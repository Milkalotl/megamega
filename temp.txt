 MARGARET FOUND APLACE AS NURSERY GOVERNESS AND FELT RICH WITH HER SMALL SALARY

 SHEFOUND IT HARDER TO BEAR THAN THE OTHERS BECAUSE SHE COULD REMEMBER ATIME WHEN HOME WAS BEAUTIFUL LIFE FULL OF EASE AND PLEASURE AND WANTOF ANY KIND UNKNOWN
 SHE TRIED NOT TO BE ENVIOUS OR DISCONTENTED BUT ITWAS VERY NATURAL THAT THE YOUNG GIRL SHOULD LONG FOR PRETTY THINGS GAYFRIENDS ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND A HAPPY LIFE
 AT THE KINGS SHE DAILY SAWALL SHE WANTED FOR THE CHILDRENS OLDER SISTERS WERE JUST OUT AND MEGCAUGHT FREQUENT GLIMPSES OF DAINTY BALLDRESSES AND BOUQUETS HEARDLIVELY GOSSIP ABOUT THEATRES CONCERTS SLEIGHING PARTIES ANDMERRYMAKINGS OF ALL KINDS AND SAW MONEY LAVISHED ON TRIFLES WHICHWOULD HAVE BEEN SO PRECIOUS TO HER
 POOR MEG SELDOM COMPLAINED BUT ASENSE OF INJUSTICE MADE HER FEEL BITTER TOWARD EVERY ONE SOMETIMES FORSHE HAD NOT YET LEARNED TO KNOW HOW RICH SHE WAS IN THE BLESSINGS WHICHALONE CAN MAKE LIFE HAPPY
JO HAPPENED TO SUIT AUNT MARCH WHO WAS LAME AND NEEDED AN ACTIVEPERSON TO WAIT UPON HER
 THE CHILDLESS OLD LADY HAD OFFERED TO ADOPT ONEOF THE GIRLS WHEN THE TROUBLES CAME AND WAS MUCH OFFENDED BECAUSE HEROFFER WAS DECLINED
 OTHER FRIENDS TOLD THE MARCHES THAT THEY HAD LOSTALL CHANCE OF BEING REMEMBERED IN THE RICH OLD LADYS WILL BUT THEUNWORLDLY MARCHES ONLY SAIDWE CANT GIVE UP OUR GIRLS FOR A DOZEN FORTUNES
 RICH OR POOR WE WILLKEEP TOGETHER AND BE HAPPY IN ONE ANOTHER
THE OLD LADY WOULDNT SPEAK TO THEM FOR A TIME BUT HAPPENING TO MEET JOAT A FRIENDS SOMETHING IN HER COMICAL FACE AND BLUNT MANNERS STRUCKTHE OLD LADYS FANCY AND SHE PROPOSED TO TAKE HER FOR A COMPANION
 THISDID NOT SUIT JO AT ALL BUT SHE ACCEPTED THE PLACE SINCE NOTHING BETTERAPPEARED AND TO EVERY ONES SURPRISE GOT ON REMARKABLY WELL WITH HERIRASCIBLE RELATIVE
 THERE WAS AN OCCASIONAL TEMPEST AND ONCE JO HADMARCHED HOME DECLARING SHE COULDNT BEAR IT ANY LONGER BUT AUNT MARCHALWAYS CLEARED UP QUICKLY AND SENT FOR HER BACK AGAIN WITH SUCH URGENCYTHAT SHE COULD NOT REFUSE FOR IN HER HEART SHE RATHER LIKED THE PEPPERYOLD LADY
I SUSPECT THAT THE REAL ATTRACTION WAS A LARGE LIBRARY OF FINE BOOKSWHICH WAS LEFT TO DUST AND SPIDERS SINCE UNCLE MARCH DIED
 JO REMEMBEREDTHE KIND OLD GENTLEMAN WHO USED TO LET HER BUILD RAILROADS AND BRIDGESWITH HIS BIG DICTIONARIES TELL HER STORIES ABOUT THE QUEER PICTURES INHIS LATIN BOOKS AND BUY HER CARDS OF GINGERBREAD WHENEVER HE MET HER INTHE STREET
 THE DIM DUSTY ROOM WITH THE BUSTS STARING DOWN FROM THETALL BOOKCASES THE COSY CHAIRS THE GLOBES AND BEST OF ALL THEWILDERNESS OF BOOKS IN WHICH SHE COULD WANDER WHERE SHE LIKED MADE THELIBRARY A REGION OF BLISS TO HER
 THE MOMENT AUNT MARCH TOOK HER NAP ORWAS BUSY WITH COMPANY JO HURRIED TO THIS QUIET PLACE AND CURLINGHERSELF UP IN THE EASYCHAIR DEVOURED POETRY ROMANCE HISTORYTRAVELS AND PICTURES LIKE A REGULAR BOOKWORM
 BUT LIKE ALLHAPPINESS IT DID NOT LAST LONG FOR AS SURE AS SHE HAD JUST REACHED THEHEART OF THE STORY THE SWEETEST VERSE OF THE SONG OR THE MOST PERILOUSADVENTURE OF HER TRAVELLER A SHRILL VOICE CALLED JOSYPHINE
JOSYPHINE
 AND SHE HAD TO LEAVE HER PARADISE TO WIND YARN WASH THEPOODLE OR READ BELSHAMS ESSAYS BY THE HOUR TOGETHER
          ILLUSTRATION CURLING HERSELF UP IN THE BIG CHAIRJOS AMBITION WAS TO DO SOMETHING VERY SPLENDID WHAT IT WAS SHE HAD NOIDEA AS YET BUT LEFT IT FOR TIME TO TELL HER AND MEANWHILE FOUNDHER GREATEST AFFLICTION IN THE FACT THAT SHE COULDNT READ RUN ANDRIDE AS MUCH AS SHE LIKED
 A QUICK TEMPER SHARP TONGUE AND RESTLESSSPIRIT WERE ALWAYS GETTING HER INTO SCRAPES AND HER LIFE WAS A SERIESOF UPS AND DOWNS WHICH WERE BOTH COMIC AND PATHETIC
 BUT THE TRAININGSHE RECEIVED AT AUNT MARCHS WAS JUST WHAT SHE NEEDED AND THE THOUGHTTHAT SHE WAS DOING SOMETHING TO SUPPORT HERSELF MADE HER HAPPY IN SPITEOF THE PERPETUAL JOSYPHINE
BETH WAS TOO BASHFUL TO GO TO SCHOOL IT HAD BEEN TRIED BUT SHESUFFERED SO MUCH THAT IT WAS GIVEN UP AND SHE DID HER LESSONS AT HOMEWITH HER FATHER
 EVEN WHEN HE WENT AWAY AND HER MOTHER WAS CALLED TODEVOTE HER SKILL AND ENERGY TO SOLDIERS AID SOCIETIES BETH WENTFAITHFULLY ON BY HERSELF AND DID THE BEST SHE COULD
 SHE WAS AHOUSEWIFELY LITTLE CREATURE AND HELPED HANNAH KEEP HOME NEAT ANDCOMFORTABLE FOR THE WORKERS NEVER THINKING OF ANY REWARD BUT TO BELOVED
 LONG QUIET DAYS SHE SPENT NOT LONELY NOR IDLE FOR HER LITTLEWORLD WAS PEOPLED WITH IMAGINARY FRIENDS AND SHE WAS BY NATURE A BUSYBEE
 THERE WERE SIX DOLLS TO BE TAKEN UP AND DRESSED EVERY MORNING FORBETH WAS A CHILD STILL AND LOVED HER PETS AS WELL AS EVER
 NOT ONEWHOLE OR HANDSOME ONE AMONG THEM ALL WERE OUTCASTS TILL BETH TOOK THEMIN FOR WHEN HER SISTERS OUTGREW THESE IDOLS THEY PASSED TO HERBECAUSE AMY WOULD HAVE NOTHING OLD OR UGLY
 BETH CHERISHED THEM ALL THEMORE TENDERLY FOR THAT VERY REASON AND SET UP A HOSPITAL FOR INFIRMDOLLS
 NO PINS WERE EVER STUCK INTO THEIR COTTON VITALS NO HARSH WORDSOR BLOWS WERE EVER GIVEN THEM NO NEGLECT EVER SADDENED THE HEART OF THEMOST REPULSIVE BUT ALL WERE FED AND CLOTHED NURSED AND CARESSED WITHAN AFFECTION WHICH NEVER FAILED
 ONE FORLORN FRAGMENT OF DOLLANITY HADBELONGED TO JO AND HAVING LED A TEMPESTUOUS LIFE WAS LEFT A WRECK INTHE RAGBAG FROM WHICH DREARY POORHOUSE IT WAS RESCUED BY BETH ANDTAKEN TO HER REFUGE
 HAVING NO TOP TO ITS HEAD SHE TIED ON A NEATLITTLE CAP AND AS BOTH ARMS AND LEGS WERE GONE SHE HID THESEDEFICIENCIES BY FOLDING IT IN A BLANKET AND DEVOTING HER BEST BED TOTHIS CHRONIC INVALID
 IF ANY ONE HAD KNOWN THE CARE LAVISHED ON THATDOLLY I THINK IT WOULD HAVE TOUCHED THEIR HEARTS EVEN WHILE THEYLAUGHED
 SHE BROUGHT IT BITS OF BOUQUETS SHE READ TO IT TOOK IT OUT TOBREATHE THE AIR HIDDEN UNDER HER COAT SHE SUNG IT LULLABYS AND NEVERWENT TO BED WITHOUT KISSING ITS DIRTY FACE AND WHISPERING TENDERLY IHOPE YOULL HAVE A GOOD NIGHT MY POOR DEAR
BETH HAD HER TROUBLES AS WELL AS THE OTHERS AND NOT BEING AN ANGEL BUTA VERY HUMAN LITTLE GIRL SHE OFTEN WEPT A LITTLE WEEP AS JO SAIDBECAUSE SHE COULDNT TAKE MUSIC LESSONS AND HAVE A FINE PIANO
 SHE LOVEDMUSIC SO DEARLY TRIED SO HARD TO LEARN AND PRACTISED AWAY SO PATIENTLYAT THE JINGLING OLD INSTRUMENT THAT IT DID SEEM AS IF SOME ONE NOT TOHINT AUNT MARCH OUGHT TO HELP HER
 NOBODY DID HOWEVER AND NOBODY SAWBETH WIPE THE TEARS OFF THE YELLOW KEYS THAT WOULDNT KEEP IN TUNEWHEN SHE WAS ALL ALONE
 SHE SANG LIKE A LITTLE LARK ABOUT HER WORKNEVER WAS TOO TIRED TO PLAY FOR MARMEE AND THE GIRLS AND DAY AFTER DAYSAID HOPEFULLY TO HERSELF I KNOW ILL GET MY MUSIC SOME TIME IF IMGOOD
THERE ARE MANY BETHS IN THE WORLD SHY AND QUIET SITTING IN CORNERSTILL NEEDED AND LIVING FOR OTHERS SO CHEERFULLY THAT NO ONE SEES THESACRIFICES TILL THE LITTLE CRICKET ON THE HEARTH STOPS CHIRPING AND THESWEET SUNSHINY PRESENCE VANISHES LEAVING SILENCE AND SHADOW BEHIND
IF ANYBODY HAD ASKED AMY WHAT THE GREATEST TRIAL OF HER LIFE WAS SHEWOULD HAVE ANSWERED AT ONCE MY NOSE
 WHEN SHE WAS A BABY JO HADACCIDENTALLY DROPPED HER INTO THE COALHOD AND AMY INSISTED THAT THEFALL HAD RUINED HER NOSE FOREVER
 IT WAS NOT BIG NOR RED LIKE POORPETREAS IT WAS ONLY RATHER FLAT AND ALL THE PINCHING IN THE WORLDCOULD NOT GIVE IT AN ARISTOCRATIC POINT
 NO ONE MINDED IT BUT HERSELFAND IT WAS DOING ITS BEST TO GROW BUT AMY FELT DEEPLY THE WANT OF AGRECIAN NOSE AND DREW WHOLE SHEETS OF HANDSOME ONES TO CONSOLE HERSELF
LITTLE RAPHAEL AS HER SISTERS CALLED HER HAD A DECIDED TALENT FORDRAWING AND WAS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN COPYING FLOWERS DESIGNINGFAIRIES OR ILLUSTRATING STORIES WITH QUEER SPECIMENS OF ART
 HERTEACHERS COMPLAINED THAT INSTEAD OF DOING HER SUMS SHE COVERED HERSLATE WITH ANIMALS THE BLANK PAGES OF HER ATLAS WERE USED TO COPY MAPSON AND CARICATURES OF THE MOST LUDICROUS DESCRIPTION CAME FLUTTERINGOUT OF ALL HER BOOKS AT UNLUCKY MOMENTS
 SHE GOT THROUGH HER LESSONS ASWELL AS SHE COULD AND MANAGED TO ESCAPE REPRIMANDS BY BEING A MODEL OFDEPORTMENT
 SHE WAS A GREAT FAVORITE WITH HER MATES BEINGGOODTEMPERED AND POSSESSING THE HAPPY ART OF PLEASING WITHOUT EFFORT
HER LITTLE AIRS AND GRACES WERE MUCH ADMIRED SO WERE HERACCOMPLISHMENTS FOR BESIDE HER DRAWING SHE COULD PLAY TWELVE TUNESCROCHET AND READ FRENCH WITHOUT MISPRONOUNCING MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OFTHE WORDS
 SHE HAD A PLAINTIVE WAY OF SAYING WHEN PAPA WAS RICH WE DIDSOANDSO WHICH WAS VERY TOUCHING AND HER LONG WORDS WERE CONSIDEREDPERFECTLY ELEGANT BY THE GIRLS
AMY WAS IN A FAIR WAY TO BE SPOILT FOR EVERY ONE PETTED HER AND HERSMALL VANITIES AND SELFISHNESSES WERE GROWING NICELY
 ONE THINGHOWEVER RATHER QUENCHED THE VANITIES SHE HAD TO WEAR HER COUSINSCLOTHES
 NOW FLORENCES MAMMA HADNT A PARTICLE OF TASTE AND AMYSUFFERED DEEPLY AT HAVING TO WEAR A RED INSTEAD OF A BLUE BONNETUNBECOMING GOWNS AND FUSSY APRONS THAT DID NOT FIT
 EVERYTHING WASGOOD WELL MADE AND LITTLE WORN BUT AMYS ARTISTIC EYES WERE MUCHAFFLICTED ESPECIALLY THIS WINTER WHEN HER SCHOOL DRESS WAS A DULLPURPLE WITH YELLOW DOTS AND NO TRIMMING
MY ONLY COMFORT SHE SAID TO MEG WITH TEARS IN HER EYES IS THATMOTHER DONT TAKE TUCKS IN MY DRESSES WHENEVER IM NAUGHTY AS MARIAPARKS MOTHER DOES
 MY DEAR ITS REALLY DREADFUL FOR SOMETIMES SHE ISSO BAD HER FROCK IS UP TO HER KNEES AND SHE CANT COME TO SCHOOL
 WHENI THINK OF THIS DEGGERREDATION I FEEL THAT I CAN BEAR EVEN MY FLATNOSE AND PURPLE GOWN WITH YELLOW SKYROCKETS ON IT
MEG WAS AMYS CONFIDANT AND MONITOR AND BY SOME STRANGE ATTRACTION OFOPPOSITES JO WAS GENTLE BETHS
 TO JO ALONE DID THE SHY CHILD TELL HERTHOUGHTS AND OVER HER BIG HARUMSCARUM SISTER BETH UNCONSCIOUSLYEXERCISED MORE INFLUENCE THAN ANY ONE IN THE FAMILY
 THE TWO OLDER GIRLSWERE A GREAT DEAL TO ONE ANOTHER BUT EACH TOOK ONE OF THE YOUNGER INTOHER KEEPING AND WATCHED OVER HER IN HER OWN WAY PLAYING MOTHER THEYCALLED IT AND PUT THEIR SISTERS IN THE PLACES OF DISCARDED DOLLS WITHTHE MATERNAL INSTINCT OF LITTLE WOMEN

 I DIDNT ENVY HER THEN FOR I FELT THAT MILLIONS OFCARNELIAN RINGS WOULDNT HAVE MADE ME HAPPY AFTER THAT
 I NEVER NEVERSHOULD HAVE GOT OVER SUCH A AGONIZING MORTIFICATION
 AND AMY WENT ONWITH HER WORK IN THE PROUD CONSCIOUSNESS OF VIRTUE AND THE SUCCESSFULUTTERANCE OF TWO LONG WORDS IN A BREATH
I SAW SOMETHING THAT I LIKED THIS MORNING AND I MEANT TO TELL IT ATDINNER BUT I FORGOT SAID BETH PUTTING JOS TOPSYTURVY BASKET INORDER AS SHE TALKED

TELL ANOTHER STORY MOTHERONE WITH A MORAL TO IT LIKE THIS
 I LIKETO THINK ABOUT THEM AFTERWARDS IF THEY ARE REAL AND NOT TOO PREACHYSAID JO AFTER A MINUTES SILENCE
MRS
 MARCH SMILED AND BEGAN AT ONCE FOR SHE HAD TOLD STORIES TO THISLITTLE AUDIENCE FOR MANY YEARS AND KNEW HOW TO PLEASE THEM
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WERE FOUR GIRLS WHO HAD ENOUGH TO EAT ANDDRINK AND WEAR A GOOD MANY COMFORTS AND PLEASURES KIND FRIENDS ANDPARENTS WHO LOVED THEM DEARLY AND YET THEY WERE NOT CONTENTED
 HERETHE LISTENERS STOLE SLY LOOKS AT ONE ANOTHER AND BEGAN TO SEWDILIGENTLY
 THESE GIRLS WERE ANXIOUS TO BE GOOD AND MADE MANYEXCELLENT RESOLUTIONS BUT THEY DID NOT KEEP THEM VERY WELL AND WERECONSTANTLY SAYING IF WE ONLY HAD THIS OR IF WE COULD ONLY DO THATQUITE FORGETTING HOW MUCH THEY ALREADY HAD AND HOW MANY PLEASANT THINGSTHEY ACTUALLY COULD DO
 SO THEY ASKED AN OLD WOMAN WHAT SPELL THEY COULDUSE TO MAKE THEM HAPPY AND SHE SAID WHEN YOU FEEL DISCONTENTED THINKOVER YOUR BLESSINGS AND BE GRATEFUL
 HERE JO LOOKED UP QUICKLY ASIF ABOUT TO SPEAK BUT CHANGED HER MIND SEEING THAT THE STORY WAS NOTDONE YET
BEING SENSIBLE GIRLS THEY DECIDED TO TRY HER ADVICE AND SOON WERESURPRISED TO SEE HOW WELL OFF THEY WERE
 ONE DISCOVERED THAT MONEYCOULDNT KEEP SHAME AND SORROW OUT OF RICH PEOPLES HOUSES ANOTHERTHAT THOUGH SHE WAS POOR SHE WAS A GREAT DEAL HAPPIER WITH HER YOUTHHEALTH AND GOOD SPIRITS THAN A CERTAIN FRETFUL FEEBLE OLD LADY WHOCOULDNT ENJOY HER COMFORTS A THIRD THAT DISAGREEABLE AS IT WAS TOHELP GET DINNER IT WAS HARDER STILL TO HAVE TO GO BEGGING FOR IT ANDTHE FOURTH THAT EVEN CARNELIAN RINGS WERE NOT SO VALUABLE AS GOODBEHAVIOR
 SO THEY AGREED TO STOP COMPLAINING TO ENJOY THE BLESSINGSALREADY POSSESSED AND TRY TO DESERVE THEM LEST THEY SHOULD BE TAKENAWAY ENTIRELY INSTEAD OF INCREASED AND I BELIEVE THEY WERE NEVERDISAPPOINTED OR SORRY THAT THEY TOOK THE OLD WOMANS ADVICE
NOW MARMEE THAT IS VERY CUNNING OF YOU TO TURN OUR OWN STORIESAGAINST US AND GIVE US A SERMON INSTEAD OF A ROMANCE

 LAURENCE
 BOTH STOOD IN A SUBURB OF THECITY WHICH WAS STILL COUNTRYLIKE WITH GROVES AND LAWNS LARGEGARDENS AND QUIET STREETS
 A LOW HEDGE PARTED THE TWO ESTATES
 ON ONESIDE WAS AN OLD BROWN HOUSE LOOKING RATHER BARE AND SHABBY ROBBED OFTHE VINES THAT IN SUMMER COVERED ITS WALLS AND THE FLOWERS WHICH THENSURROUNDED IT
 ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS A STATELY STONE MANSION PLAINLYBETOKENING EVERY SORT OF COMFORT AND LUXURY FROM THE BIG COACHHOUSEAND WELLKEPT GROUNDS TO THE CONSERVATORY AND THE GLIMPSES OF LOVELYTHINGS ONE CAUGHT BETWEEN THE RICH CURTAINS

MOTHER WHY DIDNT MR
 LAURENCE LIKE TO HAVE LAURIE PLAY

 THE LADY WAS GOOD AND LOVELY AND ACCOMPLISHED BUT HE DIDNOT LIKE HER AND NEVER SAW HIS SON AFTER HE MARRIED
 THEY BOTH DIEDWHEN LAURIE WAS A LITTLE CHILD AND THEN HIS GRANDFATHER TOOK HIM HOME
I FANCY THE BOY WHO WAS BORN IN ITALY IS NOT VERY STRONG AND THE OLDMAN IS AFRAID OF LOSING HIM WHICH MAKES HIM SO CAREFUL
 LAURIE COMESNATURALLY BY HIS LOVE OF MUSIC FOR HE IS LIKE HIS MOTHER AND I DARESAY HIS GRANDFATHER FEARS THAT HE MAY WANT TO BE A MUSICIAN AT ANYRATE HIS SKILL REMINDS HIM OF THE WOMAN HE DID NOT LIKE AND SO HEGLOWERED AS JO SAID
DEAR ME HOW ROMANTIC

 SAID JO
 LET HIM BE A MUSICIAN IF HE WANTS TO AND NOTPLAGUE HIS LIFE OUT SENDING HIM TO COLLEGE WHEN HE HATES TO GO

THE BIG HOUSE DID PROVE A PALACE BEAUTIFUL THOUGH IT TOOK SOME TIME FORALL TO GET IN AND BETH FOUND IT VERY HARD TO PASS THE LIONS
 OLD MR
LAURENCE WAS THE BIGGEST ONE BUT AFTER HE HAD CALLED SAID SOMETHINGFUNNY OR KIND TO EACH ONE OF THE GIRLS AND TALKED OVER OLD TIMES WITHTHEIR MOTHER NOBODY FELT MUCH AFRAID OF HIM EXCEPT TIMID BETH
 THEOTHER LION WAS THE FACT THAT THEY WERE POOR AND LAURIE RICH FOR THISMADE THEM SHY OF ACCEPTING FAVORS WHICH THEY COULD NOT RETURN
 BUTAFTER A WHILE THEY FOUND THAT HE CONSIDERED THEM THE BENEFACTORS ANDCOULD NOT DO ENOUGH TO SHOW HOW GRATEFUL HE WAS FOR MRS
 MARCHSMOTHERLY WELCOME THEIR CHEERFUL SOCIETY AND THE COMFORT HE TOOK INTHAT HUMBLE HOME OF THEIRS
 SO THEY SOON FORGOT THEIR PRIDE ANDINTERCHANGED KINDNESSES WITHOUT STOPPING TO THINK WHICH WAS THE GREATER
ALL SORTS OF PLEASANT THINGS HAPPENED ABOUT THAT TIME FOR THE NEWFRIENDSHIP FLOURISHED LIKE GRASS IN SPRING
 EVERY ONE LIKED LAURIE ANDHE PRIVATELY INFORMED HIS TUTOR THAT THE MARCHES WERE REGULARLYSPLENDID GIRLS
 WITH THE DELIGHTFUL ENTHUSIASM OF YOUTH THEY TOOK THESOLITARY BOY INTO THEIR MIDST AND MADE MUCH OF HIM AND HE FOUNDSOMETHING VERY CHARMING IN THE INNOCENT COMPANIONSHIP OF THESESIMPLEHEARTED GIRLS
 NEVER HAVING KNOWN MOTHER OR SISTERS HE WAS QUICKTO FEEL THE INFLUENCES THEY BROUGHT ABOUT HIM AND THEIR BUSY LIVELYWAYS MADE HIM ASHAMED OF THE INDOLENT LIFE HE LED
 HE WAS TIRED OFBOOKS AND FOUND PEOPLE SO INTERESTING NOW THAT MR
 BROOKE WAS OBLIGEDTO MAKE VERY UNSATISFACTORY REPORTS FOR LAURIE WAS ALWAYS PLAYINGTRUANT AND RUNNING OVER TO THE MARCHES
NEVER MIND LET HIM TAKE A HOLIDAY AND MAKE IT UP AFTERWARDS SAIDTHE OLD GENTLEMAN
 THE GOOD LADY NEXT DOOR SAYS HE IS STUDYING TOOHARD AND NEEDS YOUNG SOCIETY AMUSEMENT AND EXERCISE
 I SUSPECT SHE ISRIGHT AND THAT IVE BEEN CODDLING THE FELLOW AS IF ID BEEN HISGRANDMOTHER

BUT BETH THOUGH YEARNING FOR THE GRAND PIANO COULD NOT PLUCK UPCOURAGE TO GO TO THE MANSION OF BLISS AS MEG CALLED IT
 SHE WENT ONCEWITH JO BUT THE OLD GENTLEMAN NOT BEING AWARE OF HER INFIRMITY STAREDAT HER SO HARD FROM UNDER HIS HEAVY EYEBROWS AND SAID HEY
 SO LOUDTHAT HE FRIGHTENED HER SO MUCH HER FEET CHATTERED ON THE FLOOR SHETOLD HER MOTHER AND SHE RAN AWAY DECLARING SHE WOULD NEVER GO THEREANY MORE NOT EVEN FOR THE DEAR PIANO
 NO PERSUASIONS OR ENTICEMENTSCOULD OVERCOME HER FEAR TILL THE FACT COMING TO MR
 LAURENCES EAR INSOME MYSTERIOUS WAY HE SET ABOUT MENDING MATTERS
 DURING ONE OF THEBRIEF CALLS HE MADE HE ARTFULLY LED THE CONVERSATION TO MUSIC ANDTALKED AWAY ABOUT GREAT SINGERS WHOM HE HAD SEEN FINE ORGANS HE HADHEARD AND TOLD SUCH CHARMING ANECDOTES THAT BETH FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TOSTAY IN HER DISTANT CORNER BUT CREPT NEARER AND NEARER AS IFFASCINATED
 AT THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR SHE STOPPED AND STOOD LISTENINGWITH HER GREAT EYES WIDE OPEN AND HER CHEEKS RED WITH THE EXCITEMENT OFTHIS UNUSUAL PERFORMANCE
 TAKING NO MORE NOTICE OF HER THAN IF SHE HADBEEN A FLY MR
 LAURENCE TALKED ON ABOUT LAURIES LESSONS AND TEACHERSAND PRESENTLY AS IF THE IDEA HAD JUST OCCURRED TO HIM HE SAID TO MRS
MARCHTHE BOY NEGLECTS HIS MUSIC NOW AND IM GLAD OF IT FOR HE WAS GETTINGTOO FOND OF IT

SHE STAYED TILL HANNAH CAME TO TAKE HER HOME TO DINNER BUT SHE HAD NOAPPETITE AND COULD ONLY SIT AND SMILE UPON EVERY ONE IN A GENERAL STATEOF BEATITUDE
AFTER THAT THE LITTLE BROWN HOOD SLIPPED THROUGH THE HEDGE NEARLY EVERYDAY AND THE GREAT DRAWINGROOM WAS HAUNTED BY A TUNEFUL SPIRIT THATCAME AND WENT UNSEEN

 ILL HAVE AGRAND FEAST FOR I HAVENT TASTED A LIME THIS WEEK
 I FELT DELICATEABOUT TAKING ANY AS I COULDNT RETURN THEM AND IM ACTUALLY SUFFERINGFOR ONE
NEXT DAY AMY WAS RATHER LATE AT SCHOOL BUT COULD NOT RESIST THETEMPTATION OF DISPLAYING WITH PARDONABLE PRIDE A MOIST BROWNPAPERPARCEL BEFORE SHE CONSIGNED IT TO THE INMOST RECESSES OF HER DESK
DURING THE NEXT FEW MINUTES THE RUMOR THAT AMY MARCH HAD GOT TWENTYFOURDELICIOUS LIMES SHE ATE ONE ON THE WAY AND WAS GOING TO TREATCIRCULATED THROUGH HER SET AND THE ATTENTIONS OF HER FRIENDS BECAMEQUITE OVERWHELMING
 KATY BROWN INVITED HER TO HER NEXT PARTY ON THESPOT MARY KINGSLEY INSISTED ON LENDING HER HER WATCH TILL RECESS ANDJENNY SNOW A SATIRICAL YOUNG LADY WHO HAD BASELY TWITTED AMY UPON HERLIMELESS STATE PROMPTLY BURIED THE HATCHET AND OFFERED TO FURNISHANSWERS TO CERTAIN APPALLING SUMS
 BUT AMY HAD NOT FORGOTTEN MISS SNOWSCUTTING REMARKS ABOUT SOME PERSONS WHOSE NOSES WERE NOT TOO FLAT TOSMELL OTHER PEOPLES LIMES AND STUCKUP PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT TOO PROUDTO ASK FOR THEM AND SHE INSTANTLY CRUSHED THAT SNOW GIRLS HOPES BYTHE WITHERING TELEGRAM YOU NEEDNT BE SO POLITE ALL OF A SUDDEN FORYOU WONT GET ANY
A DISTINGUISHED PERSONAGE HAPPENED TO VISIT THE SCHOOL THAT MORNING ANDAMYS BEAUTIFULLY DRAWN MAPS RECEIVED PRAISE WHICH HONOR TO HER FOERANKLED IN THE SOUL OF MISS SNOW AND CAUSED MISS MARCH TO ASSUME THEAIRS OF A STUDIOUS YOUNG PEACOCK
 BUT ALAS ALAS
 PRIDE GOES BEFORE AFALL AND THE REVENGEFUL SNOW TURNED THE TABLES WITH DISASTROUS SUCCESS
NO SOONER HAD THE GUEST PAID THE USUAL STALE COMPLIMENTS AND BOWEDHIMSELF OUT THAN JENNY UNDER PRETENCE OF ASKING AN IMPORTANT QUESTIONINFORMED MR
 DAVIS THE TEACHER THAT AMY MARCH HAD PICKLED LIMES IN HERDESK
NOW MR
 DAVIS HAD DECLARED LIMES A CONTRABAND ARTICLE AND SOLEMNLYVOWED TO PUBLICLY FERRULE THE FIRST PERSON WHO WAS FOUND BREAKING THELAW
 THIS MUCHENDURING MAN HAD SUCCEEDED IN BANISHING CHEWINGGUM AFTERA LONG AND STORMY WAR HAD MADE A BONFIRE OF THE CONFISCATED NOVELS ANDNEWSPAPERS HAD SUPPRESSED A PRIVATE POSTOFFICE HAD FORBIDDENDISTORTIONS OF THE FACE NICKNAMES AND CARICATURES AND DONE ALL THATONE MAN COULD DO TO KEEP HALF A HUNDRED REBELLIOUS GIRLS IN ORDER
 BOYSARE TRYING ENOUGH TO HUMAN PATIENCE GOODNESS KNOWS
 BUT GIRLS AREINFINITELY MORE SO ESPECIALLY TO NERVOUS GENTLEMEN WITH TYRANNICALTEMPERS AND NO MORE TALENT FOR TEACHING THAN DR
 BLIMBER
 MR
 DAVISKNEW ANY QUANTITY OF GREEK LATIN ALGEBRA AND OLOGIES OF ALL SORTS SOHE WAS CALLED A FINE TEACHER AND MANNERS MORALS FEELINGS ANDEXAMPLES WERE NOT CONSIDERED OF ANY PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE
 IT WAS A MOSTUNFORTUNATE MOMENT FOR DENOUNCING AMY AND JENNY KNEW IT
 MR
 DAVIS HADEVIDENTLY TAKEN HIS COFFEE TOO STRONG THAT MORNING THERE WAS AN EASTWIND WHICH ALWAYS AFFECTED HIS NEURALGIA AND HIS PUPILS HAD NOT DONEHIM THE CREDIT WHICH HE FELT HE DESERVED THEREFORE TO USE THEEXPRESSIVE IF NOT ELEGANT LANGUAGE OF A SCHOOLGIRL HE WAS ASNERVOUS AS A WITCH AND AS CROSS AS A BEAR
 THE WORD LIMES WAS LIKEFIRE TO POWDER HIS YELLOW FACE FLUSHED AND HE RAPPED ON HIS DESK WITHAN ENERGY WHICH MADE JENNY SKIP TO HER SEAT WITH UNUSUAL RAPIDITY
YOUNG LADIES ATTENTION IF YOU PLEASE
AT THE STERN ORDER THE BUZZ CEASED AND FIFTY PAIRS OF BLUE BLACKGRAY AND BROWN EYES WERE OBEDIENTLY FIXED UPON HIS AWFUL COUNTENANCE
MISS MARCH COME TO THE DESK
AMY ROSE TO COMPLY WITH OUTWARD COMPOSURE BUT A SECRET FEAR OPPRESSEDHER FOR THE LIMES WEIGHED UPON HER CONSCIENCE
BRING WITH YOU THE LIMES YOU HAVE IN YOUR DESK WAS THE UNEXPECTEDCOMMAND WHICH ARRESTED HER BEFORE SHE GOT OUT OF HER SEAT
DONT TAKE ALL WHISPERED HER NEIGHBOR A YOUNG LADY OF GREAT PRESENCEOF MIND
AMY HASTILY SHOOK OUT HALF A DOZEN AND LAID THE REST DOWN BEFORE MR
DAVIS FEELING THAT ANY MAN POSSESSING A HUMAN HEART WOULD RELENT WHENTHAT DELICIOUS PERFUME MET HIS NOSE
 UNFORTUNATELY MR
 DAVISPARTICULARLY DETESTED THE ODOR OF THE FASHIONABLE PICKLE AND DISGUSTADDED TO HIS WRATH
IS THAT ALL
NOT QUITE STAMMERED AMY
BRING THE REST IMMEDIATELY
WITH A DESPAIRING GLANCE AT HER SET SHE OBEYED
YOU ARE SURE THERE ARE NO MORE
I NEVER LIE SIR
SO I SEE
 NOW TAKE THESE DISGUSTING THINGS TWO BY TWO AND THROW THEMOUT OF THE WINDOW
THERE WAS A SIMULTANEOUS SIGH WHICH CREATED QUITE A LITTLE GUST AS THELAST HOPE FLED AND THE TREAT WAS RAVISHED FROM THEIR LONGING LIPS
SCARLET WITH SHAME AND ANGER AMY WENT TO AND FRO SIX DREADFUL TIMESAND AS EACH DOOMED COUPLELOOKING OH
 SO PLUMP AND JUICYFELL FROM HERRELUCTANT HANDS A SHOUT FROM THE STREET COMPLETED THE ANGUISH OF THEGIRLS FOR IT TOLD THEM THAT THEIR FEAST WAS BEING EXULTED OVER BY THELITTLE IRISH CHILDREN WHO WERE THEIR SWORN FOES
 THISTHIS WAS TOOMUCH ALL FLASHED INDIGNANT OR APPEALING GLANCES AT THE INEXORABLEDAVIS AND ONE PASSIONATE LIMELOVER BURST INTO TEARS
AS AMY RETURNED FROM HER LAST TRIP MR
 DAVIS GAVE A PORTENTOUS HEM
AND SAID IN HIS MOST IMPRESSIVE MANNERYOUNG LADIES YOU REMEMBER WHAT I SAID TO YOU A WEEK AGO
 I AM SORRYTHIS HAS HAPPENED BUT I NEVER ALLOW MY RULES TO BE INFRINGED AND INEVER BREAK MY WORD
 MISS MARCH HOLD OUT YOUR HAND
AMY STARTED AND PUT BOTH HANDS BEHIND HER TURNING ON HIM AN IMPLORINGLOOK WHICH PLEADED FOR HER BETTER THAN THE WORDS SHE COULD NOT UTTER
SHE WAS RATHER A FAVORITE WITH OLD DAVIS AS OF COURSE HE WASCALLED AND ITS MY PRIVATE BELIEF THAT HE WOULD HAVE BROKEN HIS WORDIF THE INDIGNATION OF ONE IRREPRESSIBLE YOUNG LADY HAD NOT FOUND VENT INA HISS
 THAT HISS FAINT AS IT WAS IRRITATED THE IRASCIBLE GENTLEMANAND SEALED THE CULPRITS FATE
YOUR HAND MISS MARCH
 WAS THE ONLY ANSWER HER MUTE APPEAL RECEIVEDAND TOO PROUD TO CRY OR BESEECH AMY SET HER TEETH THREW BACK HERHEAD DEFIANTLY AND BORE WITHOUT FLINCHING SEVERAL TINGLING BLOWS ON HERLITTLE PALM
 THEY WERE NEITHER MANY NOR HEAVY BUT THAT MADE NODIFFERENCE TO HER
 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE SHE HAD BEEN STRUCKAND THE DISGRACE IN HER EYES WAS AS DEEP AS IF HE HAD KNOCKED HERDOWN
   ILLUSTRATION AMY BORE WITHOUT FLINCHING SEVERAL TINGLING BLOWSYOU WILL NOW STAND ON THE PLATFORM TILL RECESS SAID MR
 DAVISRESOLVED TO DO THE THING THOROUGHLY SINCE HE HAD BEGUN
THAT WAS DREADFUL
 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BAD ENOUGH TO GO TO HER SEAT ANDSEE THE PITYING FACES OF HER FRIENDS OR THE SATISFIED ONES OF HER FEWENEMIES BUT TO FACE THE WHOLE SCHOOL WITH THAT SHAME FRESH UPON HERSEEMED IMPOSSIBLE AND FOR A SECOND SHE FELT AS IF SHE COULD ONLY DROPDOWN WHERE SHE STOOD AND BREAK HER HEART WITH CRYING
 A BITTER SENSE OFWRONG AND THE THOUGHT OF JENNY SNOW HELPED HER TO BEAR IT AND TAKINGTHE IGNOMINIOUS PLACE SHE FIXED HER EYES ON THE STOVEFUNNEL ABOVE WHATNOW SEEMED A SEA OF FACES AND STOOD THERE SO MOTIONLESS AND WHITE THATTHE GIRLS FOUND IT VERY HARD TO STUDY WITH THAT PATHETIC FIGURE BEFORETHEM
DURING THE FIFTEEN MINUTES THAT FOLLOWED THE PROUD AND SENSITIVE LITTLEGIRL SUFFERED A SHAME AND PAIN WHICH SHE NEVER FORGOT
 TO OTHERS ITMIGHT SEEM A LUDICROUS OR TRIVIAL AFFAIR BUT TO HER IT WAS A HARDEXPERIENCE FOR DURING THE TWELVE YEARS OF HER LIFE SHE HAD BEENGOVERNED BY LOVE ALONE AND A BLOW OF THAT SORT HAD NEVER TOUCHED HERBEFORE
 THE SMART OF HER HAND AND THE ACHE OF HER HEART WERE FORGOTTENIN THE STING OF THE THOUGHTI SHALL HAVE TO TELL AT HOME AND THEY WILL BE SO DISAPPOINTED IN ME
THE FIFTEEN MINUTES SEEMED AN HOUR BUT THEY CAME TO AN END AT LAST ANDTHE WORD RECESS
 HAD NEVER SEEMED SO WELCOME TO HER BEFORE
YOU CAN GO MISS MARCH SAID MR
 DAVIS LOOKING AS HE FELTUNCOMFORTABLE
HE DID NOT SOON FORGET THE REPROACHFUL GLANCE AMY GAVE HIM AS SHE WENTWITHOUT A WORD TO ANY ONE STRAIGHT INTO THE ANTEROOM SNATCHED HERTHINGS AND LEFT THE PLACE FOREVER AS SHE PASSIONATELY DECLARED TOHERSELF
 SHE WAS IN A SAD STATE WHEN SHE GOT HOME AND WHEN THE OLDERGIRLS ARRIVED SOME TIME LATER AN INDIGNATION MEETING WAS HELD ATONCE
 MRS
 MARCH DID NOT SAY MUCH BUT LOOKED DISTURBED AND COMFORTEDHER AFFLICTED LITTLE DAUGHTER IN HER TENDEREST MANNER
 MEG BATHED THEINSULTED HAND WITH GLYCERINE AND TEARS BETH FELT THAT EVEN HER BELOVEDKITTENS WOULD FAIL AS A BALM FOR GRIEFS LIKE THIS JO WRATHFULLYPROPOSED THAT MR
 DAVIS BE ARRESTED WITHOUT DELAY AND HANNAH SHOOK HERFIST AT THE VILLAIN AND POUNDED POTATOES FOR DINNER AS IF SHE HAD HIMUNDER HER PESTLE
NO NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF AMYS FLIGHT EXCEPT BY HER MATES BUT THESHARPEYED DEMOISELLES DISCOVERED THAT MR
 DAVIS WAS QUITE BENIGNANT INTHE AFTERNOON ALSO UNUSUALLY NERVOUS
 JUST BEFORE SCHOOL CLOSED JOAPPEARED WEARING A GRIM EXPRESSION AS SHE STALKED UP TO THE DESK ANDDELIVERED A LETTER FROM HER MOTHER THEN COLLECTED AMYS PROPERTY ANDDEPARTED CAREFULLY SCRAPING THE MUD FROM HER BOOTS ON THE DOORMAT ASIF SHE SHOOK THE DUST OF THE PLACE OFF HER FEET

 POOR JO TRIED DESPERATELY TO BEGOOD BUT HER BOSOM ENEMY WAS ALWAYS READY TO FLAME UP AND DEFEAT HERAND IT TOOK YEARS OF PATIENT EFFORT TO SUBDUE IT
WHEN THEY GOT HOME THEY FOUND AMY READING IN THE PARLOR

 IT WAS ONLY HALF A DOZENLITTLE FAIRY TALES BUT JO HAD WORKED OVER THEM PATIENTLY PUTTING HERWHOLE HEART INTO HER WORK HOPING TO MAKE SOMETHING GOOD ENOUGH TOPRINT
 SHE HAD JUST COPIED THEM WITH GREAT CARE AND HAD DESTROYED THEOLD MANUSCRIPT SO THAT AMYS BONFIRE HAD CONSUMED THE LOVING WORK OFSEVERAL YEARS

 BUT BY AND BY WHEN I HAD FOUR LITTLE DAUGHTERS ROUND ME AND WEWERE POOR THEN THE OLD TROUBLE BEGAN AGAIN FOR I AM NOT PATIENT BYNATURE AND IT TRIED ME VERY MUCH TO SEE MY CHILDREN WANTING ANYTHING
POOR MOTHER
 WHAT HELPED YOU THEN
YOUR FATHER JO
 HE NEVER LOSES PATIENCENEVER DOUBTS ORCOMPLAINSBUT ALWAYS HOPES AND WORKS AND WAITS SO CHEERFULLY THATONE IS ASHAMED TO DO OTHERWISE BEFORE HIM
 HE HELPED AND COMFORTED MEAND SHOWED ME THAT I MUST TRY TO PRACTISE ALL THE VIRTUES I WOULD HAVEMY LITTLE GIRLS POSSESS FOR I WAS THEIR EXAMPLE
 IT WAS EASIER TO TRYFOR YOUR SAKES THAN FOR MY OWN A STARTLED OR SURPRISED LOOK FROM ONE OFYOU WHEN I SPOKE SHARPLY REBUKED ME MORE THAN ANY WORDS COULD HAVEDONE AND THE LOVE RESPECT AND CONFIDENCE OF MY CHILDREN WAS THESWEETEST REWARD I COULD RECEIVE FOR MY EFFORTS TO BE THE WOMAN I WOULDHAVE THEM COPY
O MOTHER IF IM EVER HALF AS GOOD AS YOU I SHALL BE SATISFIED CRIEDJO MUCH TOUCHED
I HOPE YOU WILL BE A GREAT DEAL BETTER DEAR BUT YOU MUST KEEP WATCHOVER YOUR BOSOM ENEMY AS FATHER CALLS IT OR IT MAY SADDEN IF NOTSPOIL YOUR LIFE
 YOU HAVE HAD A WARNING REMEMBER IT AND TRY WITH HEARTAND SOUL TO MASTER THIS QUICK TEMPER BEFORE IT BRINGS YOU GREATERSORROW AND REGRET THAN YOU HAVE KNOWN TODAY
I WILL TRY MOTHER I TRULY WILL
 BUT YOU MUST HELP ME REMIND ME ANDKEEP ME FROM FLYING OUT
 I USED TO SEE FATHER SOMETIMES PUT HIS FINGERON HIS LIPS AND LOOK AT YOU WITH A VERY KIND BUT SOBER FACE AND YOUALWAYS FOLDED YOUR LIPS TIGHT OR WENT AWAY WAS HE REMINDING YOU THEN
ASKED JO SOFTLY
YES I ASKED HIM TO HELP ME SO AND HE NEVER FORGOT IT BUT SAVED MEFROM MANY A SHARP WORD BY THAT LITTLE GESTURE AND KIND LOOK
JO SAW THAT HER MOTHERS EYES FILLED AND HER LIPS TREMBLED AS SHESPOKE AND FEARING THAT SHE HAD SAID TOO MUCH SHE WHISPERED ANXIOUSLYWAS IT WRONG TO WATCH YOU AND TO SPEAK OF IT
 I DIDNT MEAN TO BERUDE BUT ITS SO COMFORTABLE TO SAY ALL I THINK TO YOU AND FEEL SOSAFE AND HAPPY HERE
MY JO YOU MAY SAY ANYTHING TO YOUR MOTHER FOR IT IS MY GREATESTHAPPINESS AND PRIDE TO FEEL THAT MY GIRLS CONFIDE IN ME AND KNOW HOWMUCH I LOVE THEM
I THOUGHT ID GRIEVED YOU
NO DEAR BUT SPEAKING OF FATHER REMINDED ME HOW MUCH I MISS HIM HOWMUCH I OWE HIM AND HOW FAITHFULLY I SHOULD WATCH AND WORK TO KEEP HISLITTLE DAUGHTERS SAFE AND GOOD FOR HIM
YET YOU TOLD HIM TO GO MOTHER AND DIDNT CRY WHEN HE WENT AND NEVERCOMPLAIN NOW OR SEEM AS IF YOU NEEDED ANY HELP SAID JO WONDERING
I GAVE MY BEST TO THE COUNTRY I LOVE AND KEPT MY TEARS TILL HE WASGONE
 WHY SHOULD I COMPLAIN WHEN WE BOTH HAVE MERELY DONE OUR DUTY ANDWILL SURELY BE THE HAPPIER FOR IT IN THE END
 IF I DONT SEEM TO NEEDHELP IT IS BECAUSE I HAVE A BETTER FRIEND EVEN THAN FATHER TO COMFORTAND SUSTAIN ME
 MY CHILD THE TROUBLES AND TEMPTATIONS OF YOUR LIFE AREBEGINNING AND MAY BE MANY BUT YOU CAN OVERCOME AND OUTLIVE THEM ALL IFYOU LEARN TO FEEL THE STRENGTH AND TENDERNESS OF YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER ASYOU DO THAT OF YOUR EARTHLY ONE
 THE MORE YOU LOVE AND TRUST HIM THENEARER YOU WILL FEEL TO HIM AND THE LESS YOU WILL DEPEND ON HUMAN POWERAND WISDOM
 HIS LOVE AND CARE NEVER TIRE OR CHANGE CAN NEVER BE TAKENFROM YOU BUT MAY BECOME THE SOURCE OF LIFELONG PEACE HAPPINESS ANDSTRENGTH
 BELIEVE THIS HEARTILY AND GO TO GOD WITH ALL YOUR LITTLECARES AND HOPES AND SINS AND SORROWS AS FREELY AND CONFIDINGLY ASYOU COME TO YOUR MOTHER
JOS ONLY ANSWER WAS TO HOLD HER MOTHER CLOSE AND IN THE SILENCE WHICHFOLLOWED THE SINCEREST PRAYER SHE HAD EVER PRAYED LEFT HER HEARTWITHOUT WORDS FOR IN THAT SAD YET HAPPY HOUR SHE HAD LEARNED NOT ONLYTHE BITTERNESS OF REMORSE AND DESPAIR BUT THE SWEETNESS OF SELFDENIALAND SELFCONTROL AND LED BY HER MOTHERS HAND SHE HAD DRAWN NEARER TOTHE FRIEND WHO WELCOMES EVERY CHILD WITH A LOVE STRONGER THAN THAT OFANY FATHER TENDERER THAN THAT OF ANY MOTHER
AMY STIRRED AND SIGHED IN HER SLEEP AND AS IF EAGER TO BEGIN AT ONCETO MEND HER FAULT JO LOOKED UP WITH AN EXPRESSION ON HER FACE WHICH ITHAD NEVER WORN BEFORE

THE MOFFATS WERE VERY FASHIONABLE AND SIMPLE MEG WAS RATHER DAUNTEDAT FIRST BY THE SPLENDOR OF THE HOUSE AND THE ELEGANCE OF ITSOCCUPANTS
 BUT THEY WERE KINDLY PEOPLE IN SPITE OF THE FRIVOLOUS LIFETHEY LED AND SOON PUT THEIR GUEST AT HER EASE
 PERHAPS MEG FELTWITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHY THAT THEY WERE NOT PARTICULARLY CULTIVATED ORINTELLIGENT PEOPLE AND THAT ALL THEIR GILDING COULD NOT QUITE CONCEALTHE ORDINARY MATERIAL OF WHICH THEY WERE MADE

 IT SUITED HEREXACTLY AND SOON SHE BEGAN TO IMITATE THE MANNERS AND CONVERSATION OFTHOSE ABOUT HER TO PUT ON LITTLE AIRS AND GRACES USE FRENCH PHRASESCRIMP HER HAIR TAKE IN HER DRESSES AND TALK ABOUT THE FASHIONS AS WELLAS SHE COULD
 THE MORE SHE SAW OF ANNIE MOFFATS PRETTY THINGS THE MORESHE ENVIED HER AND SIGHED TO BE RICH

                          THE MASKED MARRIAGE
                           A TALE OF VENICE
    GONDOLA AFTER GONDOLA SWEPT UP TO THE MARBLE STEPS AND LEFT ITS    LOVELY LOAD TO SWELL THE BRILLIANT THRONG THAT FILLED THE    STATELY HALLS OF COUNT DE ADELON
 KNIGHTS AND LADIES ELVES AND    PAGES MONKS AND FLOWERGIRLS ALL MINGLED GAYLY IN THE DANCE
    SWEET VOICES AND RICH MELODY FILLED THE AIR AND SO WITH MIRTH    AND MUSIC THE MASQUERADE WENT ON
    HAS YOUR HIGHNESS SEEN THE LADY VIOLA TONIGHT
 ASKED A    GALLANT TROUBADOUR OF THE FAIRY QUEEN WHO FLOATED DOWN THE HALL    UPON HIS ARM
    YES IS SHE NOT LOVELY THOUGH SO SAD
 HER DRESS IS WELL    CHOSEN TOO FOR IN A WEEK SHE WEDS COUNT ANTONIO WHOM SHE    PASSIONATELY HATES
    BY MY FAITH I ENVY HIM
 YONDER HE COMES ARRAYED LIKE A    BRIDEGROOM EXCEPT THE BLACK MASK
 WHEN THAT IS OFF WE SHALL SEE    HOW HE REGARDS THE FAIR MAID WHOSE HEART HE CANNOT WIN THOUGH    HER STERN FATHER BESTOWS HER HAND RETURNED THE TROUBADOUR
    TIS WHISPERED THAT SHE LOVES THE YOUNG ENGLISH ARTIST WHO    HAUNTS HER STEPS AND IS SPURNED BY THE OLD COUNT SAID THE    LADY AS THEY JOINED THE DANCE
    THE REVEL WAS AT ITS HEIGHT WHEN A PRIEST APPEARED AND    WITHDRAWING THE YOUNG PAIR TO AN ALCOVE HUNG WITH PURPLE VELVET    HE MOTIONED THEM TO KNEEL
 INSTANT SILENCE FELL UPON THE GAY    THRONG AND NOT A SOUND BUT THE DASH OF FOUNTAINS OR THE RUSTLE    OF ORANGEGROVES SLEEPING IN THE MOONLIGHT BROKE THE HUSH AS    COUNT DE ADELON SPOKE THUS    MY LORDS AND LADIES PARDON THE RUSE BY WHICH I HAVE GATHERED    YOU HERE TO WITNESS THE MARRIAGE OF MY DAUGHTER
 FATHER WE WAIT    YOUR SERVICES
    ALL EYES TURNED TOWARD THE BRIDAL PARTY AND A LOW MURMUR OF    AMAZEMENT WENT THROUGH THE THRONG FOR NEITHER BRIDE NOR GROOM    REMOVED THEIR MASKS
 CURIOSITY AND WONDER POSSESSED ALL HEARTS    BUT RESPECT RESTRAINED ALL TONGUES TILL THE HOLY RITE WAS OVER
    THEN THE EAGER SPECTATORS GATHERED ROUND THE COUNT DEMANDING AN    EXPLANATION
    GLADLY WOULD I GIVE IT IF I COULD BUT I ONLY KNOW THAT IT WAS    THE WHIM OF MY TIMID VIOLA AND I YIELDED TO IT
 NOW MY    CHILDREN LET THE PLAY END
 UNMASK AND RECEIVE MY BLESSING
    BUT NEITHER BENT THE KNEE FOR THE YOUNG BRIDEGROOM REPLIED IN    A TONE THAT STARTLED ALL LISTENERS AS THE MASK FELL DISCLOSING    THE NOBLE FACE OF FERDINAND DEVEREUX THE ARTIST LOVER AND    LEANING ON THE BREAST WHERE NOW FLASHED THE STAR OF AN ENGLISH    EARL WAS THE LOVELY VIOLA RADIANT WITH JOY AND BEAUTY
    MY LORD YOU SCORNFULLY BADE ME CLAIM YOUR DAUGHTER WHEN I    COULD BOAST AS HIGH A NAME AND VAST A FORTUNE AS THE COUNT    ANTONIO
 I CAN DO MORE FOR EVEN YOUR AMBITIOUS SOUL CANNOT    REFUSE THE EARL OF DEVEREUX AND DE VERE WHEN HE GIVES HIS    ANCIENT NAME AND BOUNDLESS WEALTH IN RETURN FOR THE BELOVED HAND    OF THIS FAIR LADY NOW MY WIFE
    THE COUNT STOOD LIKE ONE CHANGED TO STONE AND TURNING TO THE    BEWILDERED CROWD FERDINAND ADDED WITH A GAY SMILE OF TRIUMPH    TO YOU MY GALLANT FRIENDS I CAN ONLY WISH THAT YOUR WOOING    MAY PROSPER AS MINE HAS DONE AND THAT YOU MAY ALL WIN AS FAIR A    BRIDE AS I HAVE BY THIS MASKED MARRIAGE

 CRIED JO RISING GLASS IN HAND AS THELEMONADE WENT ROUND
THEY ALL DRANK IT MERRILY AND BEGAN THE EXPERIMENT BY LOUNGING FOR THEREST OF THE DAY
 NEXT MORNING MEG DID NOT APPEAR TILL TEN OCLOCK HERSOLITARY BREAKFAST DID NOT TASTE NICE AND THE ROOM SEEMED LONELY ANDUNTIDY FOR JO HAD NOT FILLED THE VASES BETH HAD NOT DUSTED AND AMYSBOOKS LAY SCATTERED ABOUT
 NOTHING WAS NEAT AND PLEASANT BUT MARMEESCORNER WHICH LOOKED AS USUAL AND THERE MEG SAT TO REST AND READWHICH MEANT YAWN AND IMAGINE WHAT PRETTY SUMMER DRESSES SHE WOULD GETWITH HER SALARY
 JO SPENT THE MORNING ON THE RIVER WITH LAURIE AND THEAFTERNOON READING AND CRYING OVER THE WIDE WIDE WORLD UP IN THEAPPLETREE
 BETH BEGAN BY RUMMAGING EVERYTHING OUT OF THE BIG CLOSETWHERE HER FAMILY RESIDED BUT GETTING TIRED BEFORE HALF DONE SHE LEFTHER ESTABLISHMENT TOPSYTURVY AND WENT TO HER MUSIC REJOICING THAT SHEHAD NO DISHES TO WASH
 AMY ARRANGED HER BOWER PUT ON HER BEST WHITEFROCK SMOOTHED HER CURLS AND SAT DOWN TO DRAW UNDER THE HONEYSUCKLESHOPING SOME ONE WOULD SEE AND INQUIRE WHO THE YOUNG ARTIST WAS
 AS NOONE APPEARED BUT AN INQUISITIVE DADDYLONGLEGS WHO EXAMINED HER WORKWITH INTEREST SHE WENT TO WALK GOT CAUGHT IN A SHOWER AND CAME HOMEDRIPPING
                  ILLUSTRATION AMY SAT DOWN TO DRAWAT TEATIME THEY COMPARED NOTES AND ALL AGREED THAT IT HAD BEEN ADELIGHTFUL THOUGH UNUSUALLY LONG DAY
 MEG WHO WENT SHOPPING IN THEAFTERNOON AND GOT A SWEET BLUE MUSLIN HAD DISCOVERED AFTER SHE HADCUT THE BREADTHS OFF THAT IT WOULDNT WASH WHICH MISHAP MADE HERSLIGHTLY CROSS
 JO HAD BURNT THE SKIN OFF HER NOSE BOATING AND GOT ARAGING HEADACHE BY READING TOO LONG
 BETH WAS WORRIED BY THE CONFUSIONOF HER CLOSET AND THE DIFFICULTY OF LEARNING THREE OR FOUR SONGS ATONCE AND AMY DEEPLY REGRETTED THE DAMAGE DONE HER FROCK FOR KATYBROWNS PARTY WAS TO BE THE NEXT DAY AND NOW LIKE FLORA MCFLIMSEY SHEHAD NOTHING TO WEAR
 BUT THESE WERE MERE TRIFLES AND THEY ASSUREDTHEIR MOTHER THAT THE EXPERIMENT WAS WORKING FINELY
 SHE SMILED SAIDNOTHING AND WITH HANNAHS HELP DID THEIR NEGLECTED WORK KEEPING HOMEPLEASANT AND THE DOMESTIC MACHINERY RUNNING SMOOTHLY
 IT WASASTONISHING WHAT A PECULIAR AND UNCOMFORTABLE STATE OF THINGS WASPRODUCED BY THE RESTING AND REVELLING PROCESS
 THE DAYS KEPT GETTINGLONGER AND LONGER THE WEATHER WAS UNUSUALLY VARIABLE AND SO WERETEMPERS AN UNSETTLED FEELING POSSESSED EVERY ONE AND SATAN FOUNDPLENTY OF MISCHIEF FOR THE IDLE HANDS TO DO
 AS THE HEIGHT OF LUXURYMEG PUT OUT SOME OF HER SEWING AND THEN FOUND TIME HANG SO HEAVILY THATSHE FELL TO SNIPPING AND SPOILING HER CLOTHES IN HER ATTEMPTS TOFURBISH THEM UP À LA MOFFAT
 JO READ TILL HER EYES GAVE OUT AND SHE WASSICK OF BOOKS GOT SO FIDGETY THAT EVEN GOODNATURED LAURIE HAD AQUARREL WITH HER AND SO REDUCED IN SPIRITS THAT SHE DESPERATELY WISHEDSHE HAD GONE WITH AUNT MARCH
 BETH GOT ON PRETTY WELL FOR SHE WASCONSTANTLY FORGETTING THAT IT WAS TO BE ALL PLAY AND NO WORK ANDFELL BACK INTO HER OLD WAYS NOW AND THEN BUT SOMETHING IN THE AIRAFFECTED HER AND MORE THAN ONCE HER TRANQUILLITY WAS MUCH DISTURBEDSO MUCH SO THAT ON ONE OCCASION SHE ACTUALLY SHOOK POOR DEAR JOANNAAND TOLD HER SHE WAS A FRIGHT
 AMY FARED WORST OF ALL FOR HERRESOURCES WERE SMALL AND WHEN HER SISTERS LEFT HER TO AMUSE AND CAREFOR HERSELF SHE SOON FOUND THAT ACCOMPLISHED AND IMPORTANT LITTLE SELFA GREAT BURDEN
 SHE DIDNT LIKE DOLLS FAIRYTALES WERE CHILDISH ANDONE COULDNT DRAW ALL THE TIME TEAPARTIES DIDNT AMOUNT TO MUCHNEITHER DID PICNICS UNLESS VERY WELL CONDUCTED
 IF ONE COULD HAVE AFINE HOUSE FULL OF NICE GIRLS OR GO TRAVELLING THE SUMMER WOULD BEDELIGHTFUL BUT TO STAY AT HOME WITH THREE SELFISH SISTERS AND AGROWNUP BOY WAS ENOUGH TO TRY THE PATIENCE OF A BOAZ COMPLAINED MISSMALAPROP AFTER SEVERAL DAYS DEVOTED TO PLEASURE FRETTING AND ENNUI
NO ONE WOULD OWN THAT THEY WERE TIRED OF THE EXPERIMENT BUT BY FRIDAYNIGHT EACH ACKNOWLEDGED TO HERSELF THAT SHE WAS GLAD THE WEEK WASNEARLY DONE
 HOPING TO IMPRESS THE LESSON MORE DEEPLY MRS
 MARCH WHOHAD A GOOD DEAL OF HUMOR RESOLVED TO FINISH OFF THE TRIAL IN ANAPPROPRIATE MANNER SO SHE GAVE HANNAH A HOLIDAY AND LET THE GIRLSENJOY THE FULL EFFECT OF THE PLAY SYSTEM

 MRS

 A STRANGE SENSE OF HELPLESSNESSFELL UPON THE GIRLS AS THE GRAY BONNET VANISHED ROUND THE CORNER ANDDESPAIR SEIZED THEM WHEN A FEW MINUTES LATER MISS CROCKER APPEAREDAND SAID SHED COME TO DINNER
 NOW THIS LADY WAS A THIN YELLOWSPINSTER WITH A SHARP NOSE AND INQUISITIVE EYES WHO SAW EVERYTHINGAND GOSSIPED ABOUT ALL SHE SAW
 THEY DISLIKED HER BUT HAD BEEN TAUGHTTO BE KIND TO HER SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE WAS OLD AND POOR AND HAD FEWFRIENDS
 SO MEG GAVE HER THE EASYCHAIR AND TRIED TO ENTERTAIN HERWHILE SHE ASKED QUESTIONS CRITICISED EVERYTHING AND TOLD STORIES OFTHE PEOPLE WHOM SHE KNEW
LANGUAGE CANNOT DESCRIBE THE ANXIETIES EXPERIENCES AND EXERTIONS WHICHJO UNDERWENT THAT MORNING AND THE DINNER SHE SERVED UP BECAME ASTANDING JOKE
 FEARING TO ASK ANY MORE ADVICE SHE DID HER BEST ALONEAND DISCOVERED THAT SOMETHING MORE THAN ENERGY AND GOODWILL ISNECESSARY TO MAKE A COOK
 SHE BOILED THE ASPARAGUS FOR AN HOUR AND WASGRIEVED TO FIND THE HEADS COOKED OFF AND THE STALKS HARDER THAN EVER
THE BREAD BURNT BLACK FOR THE SALADDRESSING SO AGGRAVATED HER THATSHE LET EVERYTHING ELSE GO TILL SHE HAD CONVINCED HERSELF THAT SHE COULDNOT MAKE IT FIT TO EAT
 THE LOBSTER WAS A SCARLET MYSTERY TO HER BUTSHE HAMMERED AND POKED TILL IT WAS UNSHELLED AND ITS MEAGREPROPORTIONS CONCEALED IN A GROVE OF LETTUCELEAVES
 THE POTATOES HAD TOBE HURRIED NOT TO KEEP THE ASPARAGUS WAITING AND WERE NOT DONE ATLAST

 HER HOT CHEEKS COOLED A TRIFLE AND SHE DREWA LONG BREATH AS THE PRETTY GLASS PLATES WENT ROUND AND EVERY ONELOOKED GRACIOUSLY AT THE LITTLE ROSY ISLANDS FLOATING IN A SEA OF CREAM
MISS CROCKER TASTED FIRST MADE A WRY FACE AND DRANK SOME WATERHASTILY

JO UTTERED A GROAN AND FELL BACK IN HER CHAIR REMEMBERING THAT SHE HADGIVEN A LAST HASTY POWDERING TO THE BERRIES OUT OF ONE OF THE TWO BOXESON THE KITCHEN TABLE AND HAD NEGLECTED TO PUT THE MILK IN THEREFRIGERATOR
 SHE TURNED SCARLET AND WAS ON THE VERGE OF CRYING WHENSHE MET LAURIES EYES WHICH WOULD LOOK MERRY IN SPITE OF HIS HEROICEFFORTS THE COMICAL SIDE OF THE AFFAIR SUDDENLY STRUCK HER AND SHELAUGHED TILL THE TEARS RAN DOWN HER CHEEKS
 SO DID EVERY ONE ELSE EVENCROAKER AS THE GIRLS CALLED THE OLD LADY AND THE UNFORTUNATE DINNERENDED GAYLY WITH BREAD AND BUTTER OLIVES AND FUN
I HAVENT STRENGTH OF MIND ENOUGH TO CLEAR UP NOW SO WE WILL SOBEROURSELVES WITH A FUNERAL SAID JO AS THEY ROSE AND MISS CROCKER MADEREADY TO GO BEING EAGER TO TELL THE NEW STORY AT ANOTHER FRIENDSDINNERTABLE

 KEEP THEHOUSE QUIET LET HER SLEEP AND WHEN SHE WAKES GIVE HERWHAT THEY WERE TO GIVE NEITHER HEARD FOR BOTH CREPT INTO THE DARKHALL AND SITTING ON THE STAIRS HELD EACH OTHER CLOSE REJOICING WITHHEARTS TOO FULL FOR WORDS
 WHEN THEY WENT BACK TO BE KISSED AND CUDDLEDBY FAITHFUL HANNAH THEY FOUND BETH LYING AS SHE USED TO DO WITH HERCHEEK PILLOWED ON HER HAND THE DREADFUL PALLOR GONE AND BREATHINGQUIETLY AS IF JUST FALLEN ASLEEP

 CRIED JO STARTING TO HER FEET
YES THERE WAS A SOUND OF BELLS AT THE DOOR BELOW A CRY FROM HANNAHAND THEN LAURIES VOICE SAYING IN A JOYFUL WHISPER GIRLS SHES COME

                              AMYS WILL
WHILE THESE THINGS WERE HAPPENING AT HOME AMY WAS HAVING HARD TIMES ATAUNT MARCHS
 SHE FELT HER EXILE DEEPLY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HERLIFE REALIZED HOW MUCH SHE WAS BELOVED AND PETTED AT HOME
 AUNT MARCHNEVER PETTED ANY ONE SHE DID NOT APPROVE OF IT BUT SHE MEANT TO BEKIND FOR THE WELLBEHAVED LITTLE GIRL PLEASED HER VERY MUCH AND AUNTMARCH HAD A SOFT PLACE IN HER OLD HEART FOR HER NEPHEWS CHILDRENTHOUGH SHE DIDNT THINK PROPER TO CONFESS IT
 SHE REALLY DID HER BEST TOMAKE AMY HAPPY BUT DEAR ME WHAT MISTAKES SHE MADE
 SOME OLD PEOPLEKEEP YOUNG AT HEART IN SPITE OF WRINKLES AND GRAY HAIRS CAN SYMPATHIZEWITH CHILDRENS LITTLE CARES AND JOYS MAKE THEM FEEL AT HOME AND CANHIDE WISE LESSONS UNDER PLEASANT PLAYS GIVING AND RECEIVING FRIENDSHIPIN THE SWEETEST WAY
 BUT AUNT MARCH HAD NOT THIS GIFT AND SHE WORRIEDAMY VERY MUCH WITH HER RULES AND ORDERS HER PRIM WAYS AND LONG PROSYTALKS
 FINDING THE CHILD MORE DOCILE AND AMIABLE THAN HER SISTER THEOLD LADY FELT IT HER DUTY TO TRY AND COUNTERACT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE THEBAD EFFECTS OF HOME FREEDOM AND INDULGENCE
 SO SHE TOOK AMY IN HAND ANDTAUGHT HER AS SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN TAUGHT SIXTY YEARS AGOA PROCESSWHICH CARRIED DISMAY TO AMYS SOUL AND MADE HER FEEL LIKE A FLY IN THEWEB OF A VERY STRICT SPIDER
     ILLUSTRATION POLISH UP THE SPOONS AND THE FAT SILVER TEAPOTSHE HAD TO WASH THE CUPS EVERY MORNING AND POLISH UP THE OLDFASHIONEDSPOONS THE FAT SILVER TEAPOT AND THE GLASSES TILL THEY SHONE
 THENSHE MUST DUST THE ROOM AND WHAT A TRYING JOB THAT WAS
 NOT A SPECKESCAPED AUNT MARCHS EYE AND ALL THE FURNITURE HAD CLAW LEGS AND MUCHCARVING WHICH WAS NEVER DUSTED TO SUIT
 THEN POLLY MUST BE FED THELAPDOG COMBED AND A DOZEN TRIPS UPSTAIRS AND DOWN TO GET THINGS ORDELIVER ORDERS FOR THE OLD LADY WAS VERY LAME AND SELDOM LEFT HER BIGCHAIR
 AFTER THESE TIRESOME LABORS SHE MUST DO HER LESSONS WHICH WAS ADAILY TRIAL OF EVERY VIRTUE SHE POSSESSED
 THEN SHE WAS ALLOWED ONE HOURFOR EXERCISE OR PLAY AND DIDNT SHE ENJOY IT
 LAURIE CAME EVERY DAYAND WHEEDLED AUNT MARCH TILL AMY WAS ALLOWED TO GO OUT WITH HIM WHENTHEY WALKED AND RODE AND HAD CAPITAL TIMES
 AFTER DINNER SHE HAD TOREAD ALOUD AND SIT STILL WHILE THE OLD LADY SLEPT WHICH SHE USUALLYDID FOR AN HOUR AS SHE DROPPED OFF OVER THE FIRST PAGE
 THEN PATCHWORKOR TOWELS APPEARED AND AMY SEWED WITH OUTWARD MEEKNESS AND INWARDREBELLION TILL DUSK WHEN SHE WAS ALLOWED TO AMUSE HERSELF AS SHE LIKEDTILL TEATIME
 THE EVENINGS WERE THE WORST OF ALL FOR AUNT MARCH FELLTO TELLING LONG STORIES ABOUT HER YOUTH WHICH WERE SO UNUTTERABLY DULLTHAT AMY WAS ALWAYS READY TO GO TO BED INTENDING TO CRY OVER HER HARDFATE BUT USUALLY GOING TO SLEEP BEFORE SHE HAD SQUEEZED OUT MORE THAN ATEAR OR TWO
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR LAURIE AND OLD ESTHER THE MAID SHE FELT THATSHE NEVER COULD HAVE GOT THROUGH THAT DREADFUL TIME
 THE PARROT ALONEWAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE HER DISTRACTED FOR HE SOON FELT THAT SHE DID NOTADMIRE HIM AND REVENGED HIMSELF BY BEING AS MISCHIEVOUS AS POSSIBLE
 HEPULLED HER HAIR WHENEVER SHE CAME NEAR HIM UPSET HIS BREAD AND MILK TOPLAGUE HER WHEN SHE HAD NEWLY CLEANED HIS CAGE MADE MOP BARK BY PECKINGAT HIM WHILE MADAM DOZED CALLED HER NAMES BEFORE COMPANY AND BEHAVEDIN ALL RESPECTS LIKE A REPREHENSIBLE OLD BIRD
 THEN SHE COULD NOT ENDURETHE DOGA FAT CROSS BEAST WHO SNARLED AND YELPED AT HER WHEN SHEMADE HIS TOILET AND WHO LAY ON HIS BACK WITH ALL HIS LEGS IN THE AIRAND A MOST IDIOTIC EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE WHEN HE WANTED SOMETHING TOEAT WHICH WAS ABOUT A DOZEN TIMES A DAY
 THE COOK WAS BADTEMPERED THEOLD COACHMAN DEAF AND ESTHER THE ONLY ONE WHO EVER TOOK ANY NOTICE OFTHE YOUNG LADY
       ILLUSTRATION ON HIS BACK WITH ALL HIS LEGS IN THE AIRESTHER WAS A FRENCHWOMAN WHO HAD LIVED WITH MADAME AS SHE CALLED HERMISTRESS FOR MANY YEARS AND WHO RATHER TYRANNIZED OVER THE OLD LADYWHO COULD NOT GET ALONG WITHOUT HER
 HER REAL NAME WAS ESTELLE BUTAUNT MARCH ORDERED HER TO CHANGE IT AND SHE OBEYED ON CONDITION THATSHE WAS NEVER ASKED TO CHANGE HER RELIGION
 SHE TOOK A FANCY TOMADEMOISELLE AND AMUSED HER VERY MUCH WITH ODD STORIES OF HER LIFE INFRANCE WHEN AMY SAT WITH HER WHILE SHE GOT UP MADAMES LACES
 SHE ALSOALLOWED HER TO ROAM ABOUT THE GREAT HOUSE AND EXAMINE THE CURIOUS ANDPRETTY THINGS STORED AWAY IN THE BIG WARDROBES AND THE ANCIENT CHESTSFOR AUNT MARCH HOARDED LIKE A MAGPIE
 AMYS CHIEF DELIGHT WAS AN INDIANCABINET FULL OF QUEER DRAWERS LITTLE PIGEONHOLES AND SECRET PLACESIN WHICH WERE KEPT ALL SORTS OF ORNAMENTS SOME PRECIOUS SOME MERELYCURIOUS ALL MORE OR LESS ANTIQUE
 TO EXAMINE AND ARRANGE THESE THINGSGAVE AMY GREAT SATISFACTION ESPECIALLY THE JEWELCASES IN WHICH ONVELVET CUSHIONS REPOSED THE ORNAMENTS WHICH HAD ADORNED A BELLE FORTYYEARS AGO
 THERE WAS THE GARNET SET WHICH AUNT MARCH WORE WHEN SHE CAMEOUT THE PEARLS HER FATHER GAVE HER ON HER WEDDINGDAY HER LOVERSDIAMONDS THE JET MOURNING RINGS AND PINS THE QUEER LOCKETS WITHPORTRAITS OF DEAD FRIENDS AND WEEPING WILLOWS MADE OF HAIR INSIDE THEBABY BRACELETS HER ONE LITTLE DAUGHTER HAD WORN UNCLE MARCHS BIGWATCH WITH THE RED SEAL SO MANY CHILDISH HANDS HAD PLAYED WITH AND INA BOX ALL BY ITSELF LAY AUNT MARCHS WEDDINGRING TOO SMALL NOW FORHER FAT FINGER BUT PUT CAREFULLY AWAY LIKE THE MOST PRECIOUS JEWEL OFTHEM ALL
                  ILLUSTRATION I SHOULD CHOOSE THISWHICH WOULD MADEMOISELLE CHOOSE IF SHE HAD HER WILL
 ASKED ESTHER WHOALWAYS SAT NEAR TO WATCH OVER AND LOCK UP THE VALUABLES
I LIKE THE DIAMONDS BEST BUT THERE IS NO NECKLACE AMONG THEM AND IMFOND OF NECKLACES THEY ARE SO BECOMING
 I SHOULD CHOOSE THIS IF IMIGHT REPLIED AMY LOOKING WITH GREAT ADMIRATION AT A STRING OF GOLDAND EBONY BEADS FROM WHICH HUNG A HEAVY CROSS OF THE SAME
I TOO COVET THAT BUT NOT AS A NECKLACE AH NO
 TO ME IT IS AROSARY AND AS SUCH I SHOULD USE IT LIKE A GOOD CATHOLIC SAID ESTHEREYING THE HANDSOME THING WISTFULLY
IS IT MEANT TO USE AS YOU USE THE STRING OF GOODSMELLING WOODEN BEADSHANGING OVER YOUR GLASS
 ASKED AMY
TRULY YES TO PRAY WITH
 IT WOULD BE PLEASING TO THE SAINTS IF ONEUSED SO FINE A ROSARY AS THIS INSTEAD OF WEARING IT AS A VAIN BIJOU
YOU SEEM TO TAKE A GREAT DEAL OF COMFORT IN YOUR PRAYERS ESTHER ANDALWAYS COME DOWN LOOKING QUIET AND SATISFIED
 I WISH I COULD
IF MADEMOISELLE WAS A CATHOLIC SHE WOULD FIND TRUE COMFORT BUT ASTHAT IS NOT TO BE IT WOULD BE WELL IF YOU WENT APART EACH DAY TOMEDITATE AND PRAY AS DID THE GOOD MISTRESS WHOM I SERVED BEFORE MADAME
SHE HAD A LITTLE CHAPEL AND IN IT FOUND SOLACEMENT FOR MUCH TROUBLE
WOULD IT BE RIGHT FOR ME TO DO SO TOO
 ASKED AMY WHO IN HERLONELINESS FELT THE NEED OF HELP OF SOME SORT AND FOUND THAT SHE WASAPT TO FORGET HER LITTLE BOOK NOW THAT BETH WAS NOT THERE TO REMIND HEROF IT
IT WOULD BE EXCELLENT AND CHARMING AND I SHALL GLADLY ARRANGE THELITTLE DRESSINGROOM FOR YOU IF YOU LIKE IT
 SAY NOTHING TO MADAME BUTWHEN SHE SLEEPS GO YOU AND SIT ALONE A WHILE TO THINK GOOD THOUGHTS ANDPRAY THE DEAR GOD TO PRESERVE YOUR SISTER
ESTHER WAS TRULY PIOUS AND QUITE SINCERE IN HER ADVICE FOR SHE HAD ANAFFECTIONATE HEART AND FELT MUCH FOR THE SISTERS IN THEIR ANXIETY
 AMYLIKED THE IDEA AND GAVE HER LEAVE TO ARRANGE THE LIGHT CLOSET NEXT HERROOM HOPING IT WOULD DO HER GOOD
I WISH I KNEW WHERE ALL THESE PRETTY THINGS WOULD GO WHEN AUNT MARCHDIES SHE SAID AS SHE SLOWLY REPLACED THE SHINING ROSARY AND SHUT THEJEWELCASES ONE BY ONE
TO YOU AND YOUR SISTERS
 I KNOW IT MADAME CONFIDES IN ME I WITNESSEDHER WILL AND IT IS TO BE SO WHISPERED ESTHER SMILING
HOW NICE
 BUT I WISH SHED LET US HAVE THEM NOW
 PROCRASTINATION ISNOT AGREEABLE OBSERVED AMY TAKING A LAST LOOK AT THE DIAMONDS
IT IS TOO SOON YET FOR THE YOUNG LADIES TO WEAR THESE THINGS
 THE FIRSTONE WHO IS AFFIANCED WILL HAVE THE PEARLSMADAME HAS SAID IT AND IHAVE A FANCY THAT THE LITTLE TURQUOISE RING WILL BE GIVEN TO YOU WHENYOU GO FOR MADAME APPROVES YOUR GOOD BEHAVIOR AND CHARMING MANNERS
DO YOU THINK SO
 OH ILL BE A LAMB IF I CAN ONLY HAVE THAT LOVELYRING
 ITS EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN KITTY BRYANTS
 I DO LIKE AUNTMARCH AFTER ALL AND AMY TRIED ON THE BLUE RING WITH A DELIGHTED FACEAND A FIRM RESOLVE TO EARN IT
FROM THAT DAY SHE WAS A MODEL OF OBEDIENCE AND THE OLD LADYCOMPLACENTLY ADMIRED THE SUCCESS OF HER TRAINING
 ESTHER FITTED UP THECLOSET WITH A LITTLE TABLE PLACED A FOOTSTOOL BEFORE IT AND OVER IT APICTURE TAKEN FROM ONE OF THE SHUTUP ROOMS
 SHE THOUGHT IT WAS OF NOGREAT VALUE BUT BEING APPROPRIATE SHE BORROWED IT WELL KNOWING THATMADAME WOULD NEVER KNOW IT NOR CARE IF SHE DID
 IT WAS HOWEVER A VERYVALUABLE COPY OF ONE OF THE FAMOUS PICTURES OF THE WORLD AND AMYSBEAUTYLOVING EYES WERE NEVER TIRED OF LOOKING UP AT THE SWEET FACE OFTHE DIVINE MOTHER WHILE TENDER THOUGHTS OF HER OWN WERE BUSY AT HERHEART
 ON THE TABLE SHE LAID HER LITTLE TESTAMENT AND HYMNBOOK KEPT AVASE ALWAYS FULL OF THE BEST FLOWERS LAURIE BROUGHT HER AND CAME EVERYDAY TO SIT ALONE THINKING GOOD THOUGHTS AND PRAYING THE DEAR GOD TOPRESERVE HER SISTER
 ESTHER HAD GIVEN HER A ROSARY OF BLACK BEADS WITHA SILVER CROSS BUT AMY HUNG IT UP AND DID NOT USE IT FEELING DOUBTFULAS TO ITS FITNESS FOR PROTESTANT PRAYERS
THE LITTLE GIRL WAS VERY SINCERE IN ALL THIS FOR BEING LEFT ALONEOUTSIDE THE SAFE HOMENEST SHE FELT THE NEED OF SOME KIND HAND TO HOLDBY SO SORELY THAT SHE INSTINCTIVELY TURNED TO THE STRONG AND TENDERFRIEND WHOSE FATHERLY LOVE MOST CLOSELY SURROUNDS HIS LITTLE CHILDREN
SHE MISSED HER MOTHERS HELP TO UNDERSTAND AND RULE HERSELF BUT HAVINGBEEN TAUGHT WHERE TO LOOK SHE DID HER BEST TO FIND THE WAY AND WALK INIT CONFIDINGLY
 BUT AMY WAS A YOUNG PILGRIM AND JUST NOW HER BURDENSEEMED VERY HEAVY
 SHE TRIED TO FORGET HERSELF TO KEEP CHEERFUL AND BESATISFIED WITH DOING RIGHT THOUGH NO ONE SAW OR PRAISED HER FOR IT
 INHER FIRST EFFORT AT BEING VERY VERY GOOD SHE DECIDED TO MAKE HER WILLAS AUNT MARCH HAD DONE SO THAT IF SHE DID FALL ILL AND DIE HERPOSSESSIONS MIGHT BE JUSTLY AND GENEROUSLY DIVIDED
 IT COST HER A PANGEVEN TO THINK OF GIVING UP THE LITTLE TREASURES WHICH IN HER EYES WEREAS PRECIOUS AS THE OLD LADYS JEWELS
DURING ONE OF HER PLAYHOURS SHE WROTE OUT THE IMPORTANT DOCUMENT ASWELL AS SHE COULD WITH SOME HELP FROM ESTHER AS TO CERTAIN LEGAL TERMSAND WHEN THE GOODNATURED FRENCHWOMAN HAD SIGNED HER NAME AMY FELTRELIEVED AND LAID IT BY TO SHOW LAURIE WHOM SHE WANTED AS A SECONDWITNESS
 AS IT WAS A RAINY DAY SHE WENT UPSTAIRS TO AMUSE HERSELF INONE OF THE LARGE CHAMBERS AND TOOK POLLY WITH HER FOR COMPANY
 IN THISROOM THERE WAS A WARDROBE FULL OF OLDFASHIONED COSTUMES WITH WHICHESTHER ALLOWED HER TO PLAY AND IT WAS HER FAVORITE AMUSEMENT TO ARRAYHERSELF IN THE FADED BROCADES AND PARADE UP AND DOWN BEFORE THE LONGMIRROR MAKING STATELY COURTESIES AND SWEEPING HER TRAIN ABOUT WITH ARUSTLE WHICH DELIGHTED HER EARS
 SO BUSY WAS SHE ON THIS DAY THAT SHEDID NOT HEAR LAURIES RING NOR SEE HIS FACE PEEPING IN AT HER AS SHEGRAVELY PROMENADED TO AND FRO FLIRTING HER FAN AND TOSSING HER HEAD ONWHICH SHE WORE A GREAT PINK TURBAN CONTRASTING ODDLY WITH HER BLUEBROCADE DRESS AND YELLOW QUILTED PETTICOAT
 SHE WAS OBLIGED TO WALKCAREFULLY FOR SHE HAD ON HIGHHEELED SHOES AND AS LAURIE TOLD JOAFTERWARD IT WAS A COMICAL SIGHT TO SEE HER MINCE ALONG IN HER GAYSUIT WITH POLLY SIDLING AND BRIDLING JUST BEHIND HER IMITATING HER ASWELL AS HE COULD AND OCCASIONALLY STOPPING TO LAUGH OR EXCLAIM AINTWE FINE
 GET ALONG YOU FRIGHT
 HOLD YOUR TONGUE

I DONT THINK I HAVE ANY WORDS IN WHICH TO TELL THE MEETING OF THEMOTHER AND DAUGHTERS SUCH HOURS ARE BEAUTIFUL TO LIVE BUT VERY HARD TODESCRIBE SO I WILL LEAVE IT TO THE IMAGINATION OF MY READERS MERELYSAYING THAT THE HOUSE WAS FULL OF GENUINE HAPPINESS AND THAT MEGSTENDER HOPE WAS REALIZED FOR WHEN BETH WOKE FROM THAT LONG HEALINGSLEEP THE FIRST OBJECTS ON WHICH HER EYES FELL WERE THE LITTLE ROSEAND MOTHERS FACE
 TOO WEAK TO WONDER AT ANYTHING SHE ONLY SMILED ANDNESTLED CLOSE INTO THE LOVING ARMS ABOUT HER FEELING THAT THE HUNGRYLONGING WAS SATISFIED AT LAST
 THEN SHE SLEPT AGAIN AND THE GIRLSWAITED UPON THEIR MOTHER FOR SHE WOULD NOT UNCLASP THE THIN HAND WHICHCLUNG TO HERS EVEN IN SLEEP
 HANNAH HAD DISHED UP AN ASTONISHINGBREAKFAST FOR THE TRAVELLER FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO VENT HEREXCITEMENT IN ANY OTHER WAY AND MEG AND JO FED THEIR MOTHER LIKEDUTIFUL YOUNG STORKS WHILE THEY LISTENED TO HER WHISPERED ACCOUNT OFFATHERS STATE MR

 MRS
 MARCH WOULD NOT LEAVEBETHS SIDE BUT RESTED IN THE BIG CHAIR WAKING OFTEN TO LOOK ATTOUCH AND BROOD OVER HER CHILD LIKE A MISER OVER SOME RECOVEREDTREASURE
LAURIE MEANWHILE POSTED OFF TO COMFORT AMY AND TOLD HIS STORY SO WELLTHAT AUNT MARCH ACTUALLY SNIFFED HERSELF AND NEVER ONCE SAID I TOLDYOU SO
 AMY CAME OUT SO STRONG ON THIS OCCASION THAT I THINK THE GOODTHOUGHTS IN THE LITTLE CHAPEL REALLY BEGAN TO BEAR FRUIT
 SHE DRIED HERTEARS QUICKLY RESTRAINED HER IMPATIENCE TO SEE HER MOTHER AND NEVEREVEN THOUGHT OF THE TURQUOISE RING WHEN THE OLD LADY HEARTILY AGREED INLAURIES OPINION THAT SHE BEHAVED LIKE A CAPITAL LITTLE WOMAN
 EVENPOLLY SEEMED IMPRESSED FOR HE CALLED HER GOOD GIRL BLESSED HERBUTTONS AND BEGGED HER TO COME AND TAKE A WALK DEAR IN HIS MOSTAFFABLE TONE
 SHE WOULD VERY GLADLY HAVE GONE OUT TO ENJOY THE BRIGHTWINTRY WEATHER BUT DISCOVERING THAT LAURIE WAS DROPPING WITH SLEEP INSPITE OF MANFUL EFFORTS TO CONCEAL THE FACT SHE PERSUADED HIM TO RESTON THE SOFA WHILE SHE WROTE A NOTE TO HER MOTHER
 SHE WAS A LONG TIMEABOUT IT AND WHEN SHE RETURNED HE WAS STRETCHED OUT WITH BOTH ARMSUNDER HIS HEAD SOUND ASLEEP WHILE AUNT MARCH HAD PULLED DOWN THECURTAINS AND SAT DOING NOTHING IN AN UNUSUAL FIT OF BENIGNITY
AFTER A WHILE THEY BEGAN TO THINK HE WAS NOT GOING TO WAKE TILL NIGHTAND IM NOT SURE THAT HE WOULD HAD HE NOT BEEN EFFECTUALLY ROUSED BYAMYS CRY OF JOY AT SIGHT OF HER MOTHER
 THERE PROBABLY WERE A GOODMANY HAPPY LITTLE GIRLS IN AND ABOUT THE CITY THAT DAY BUT IT IS MYPRIVATE OPINION THAT AMY WAS THE HAPPIEST OF ALL WHEN SHE SAT IN HERMOTHERS LAP AND TOLD HER TRIALS RECEIVING CONSOLATION AND COMPENSATIONIN THE SHAPE OF APPROVING SMILES AND FOND CARESSES
 THEY WERE ALONETOGETHER IN THE CHAPEL TO WHICH HER MOTHER DID NOT OBJECT WHEN ITSPURPOSE WAS EXPLAINED TO HER
ON THE CONTRARY I LIKE IT VERY MUCH DEAR LOOKING FROM THE DUSTYROSARY TO THE WELLWORN LITTLE BOOK AND THE LOVELY PICTURE WITH ITSGARLAND OF EVERGREEN
 IT IS AN EXCELLENT PLAN TO HAVE SOME PLACE WHEREWE CAN GO TO BE QUIET WHEN THINGS VEX OR GRIEVE US
 THERE ARE A GOODMANY HARD TIMES IN THIS LIFE OF OURS BUT WE CAN ALWAYS BEAR THEM IF WEASK HELP IN THE RIGHT WAY
 I THINK MY LITTLE GIRL IS LEARNING THIS
YES MOTHER AND WHEN I GO HOME I MEAN TO HAVE A CORNER IN THE BIGCLOSET TO PUT MY BOOKS AND THE COPY OF THAT PICTURE WHICH IVE TRIED TOMAKE
 THE WOMANS FACE IS NOT GOODITS TOO BEAUTIFUL FOR ME TODRAWBUT THE BABY IS DONE BETTER AND I LOVE IT VERY MUCH

 AMY LOOKED SO EARNEST AND SINCEREABOUT IT THAT HER MOTHER STOPPED LAUGHING AND LISTENED RESPECTFULLY TOTHE LITTLE PLAN
IVE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL LATELY ABOUT MY BUNDLE OF NAUGHTIES ANDBEING SELFISH IS THE LARGEST ONE IN IT SO IM GOING TO TRY HARD TO CUREIT IF I CAN

 I SHOULDLIKE TO KNOW THAT JOHN WAS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED IN SOME GOOD BUSINESSWHICH GAVE HIM AN INCOME LARGE ENOUGH TO KEEP FREE FROM DEBT AND MAKEMEG COMFORTABLE
 IM NOT AMBITIOUS FOR A SPLENDID FORTUNE A FASHIONABLEPOSITION OR A GREAT NAME FOR MY GIRLS
 IF RANK AND MONEY COME WITHLOVE AND VIRTUE ALSO I SHOULD ACCEPT THEM GRATEFULLY AND ENJOY YOURGOOD FORTUNE BUT I KNOW BY EXPERIENCE HOW MUCH GENUINE HAPPINESS CANBE HAD IN A PLAIN LITTLE HOUSE WHERE THE DAILY BREAD IS EARNED ANDSOME PRIVATIONS GIVE SWEETNESS TO THE FEW PLEASURES
 I AM CONTENT TO SEEMEG BEGIN HUMBLY FOR IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN SHE WILL BE RICH IN THEPOSSESSION OF A GOOD MANS HEART AND THAT IS BETTER THAN A FORTUNE

 OF COURSE THERE WAS A GENERAL STAMPEDE AND FOR SEVERALMINUTES EVERYBODY SEEMED TO LOSE THEIR WITS FOR THE STRANGEST THINGSWERE DONE AND NO ONE SAID A WORD
 MR
 MARCH BECAME INVISIBLE IN THEEMBRACE OF FOUR PAIRS OF LOVING ARMS JO DISGRACED HERSELF BY NEARLYFAINTING AWAY AND HAD TO BE DOCTORED BY LAURIE IN THE CHINACLOSET MR
BROOKE KISSED MEG ENTIRELY BY MISTAKE AS HE SOMEWHAT INCOHERENTLYEXPLAINED AND AMY THE DIGNIFIED TUMBLED OVER A STOOL AND NEVERSTOPPING TO GET UP HUGGED AND CRIED OVER HER FATHERS BOOTS IN THE MOSTTOUCHING MANNER

 REMEMBER BETH
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE THE STUDY DOOR FLEW OPEN THE LITTLE RED WRAPPERAPPEARED ON THE THRESHOLDJOY PUT STRENGTH INTO THE FEEBLE LIMBSANDBETH RAN STRAIGHT INTO HER FATHERS ARMS
 NEVER MIND WHAT HAPPENED JUSTAFTER THAT FOR THE FULL HEARTS OVERFLOWED WASHING AWAY THE BITTERNESSOF THE PAST AND LEAVING ONLY THE SWEETNESS OF THE PRESENT
IT WAS NOT AT ALL ROMANTIC BUT A HEARTY LAUGH SET EVERYBODY STRAIGHTAGAIN FOR HANNAH WAS DISCOVERED BEHIND THE DOOR SOBBING OVER THE FATTURKEY WHICH SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO PUT DOWN WHEN SHE RUSHED UP FROM THEKITCHEN
 AS THE LAUGH SUBSIDED MRS
 MARCH BEGAN TO THANK MR
 BROOKE FORHIS FAITHFUL CARE OF HER HUSBAND AT WHICH MR
 BROOKE SUDDENLYREMEMBERED THAT MR
 MARCH NEEDED REST AND SEIZING LAURIE HEPRECIPITATELY RETIRED
 THEN THE TWO INVALIDS WERE ORDERED TO REPOSEWHICH THEY DID BY BOTH SITTING IN ONE BIG CHAIR AND TALKING HARD
MR
 MARCH TOLD HOW HE HAD LONGED TO SURPRISE THEM AND HOW WHEN THEFINE WEATHER CAME HE HAD BEEN ALLOWED BY HIS DOCTOR TO TAKE ADVANTAGEOF IT HOW DEVOTED BROOKE HAD BEEN AND HOW HE WAS ALTOGETHER A MOSTESTIMABLE AND UPRIGHT YOUNG MAN
 WHY MR
 MARCH PAUSED A MINUTE JUSTTHERE AND AFTER A GLANCE AT MEG WHO WAS VIOLENTLY POKING THE FIRELOOKED AT HIS WIFE WITH AN INQUIRING LIFT OF THE EYEBROWS I LEAVE YOUTO IMAGINE ALSO WHY MRS
 MARCH GENTLY NODDED HER HEAD AND ASKEDRATHER ABRUPTLY IF HE WOULDNT HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT
 JO SAW ANDUNDERSTOOD THE LOOK AND SHE STALKED GRIMLY AWAY TO GET WINE ANDBEEFTEA MUTTERING TO HERSELF AS SHE SLAMMED THE DOOR I HATEESTIMABLE YOUNG MEN WITH BROWN EYES
THERE NEVER WAS SUCH A CHRISTMAS DINNER AS THEY HAD THAT DAY
 THE FATTURKEY WAS A SIGHT TO BEHOLD WHEN HANNAH SENT HIM UP STUFFED BROWNEDAND DECORATED SO WAS THE PLUMPUDDING WHICH QUITE MELTED IN ONESMOUTH LIKEWISE THE JELLIES IN WHICH AMY REVELLED LIKE A FLY IN AHONEYPOT
 EVERYTHING TURNED OUT WELL WHICH WAS A MERCY HANNAH SAIDFOR MY MIND WAS THAT FLUSTERED MUM THAT ITS A MERRYCLE I DIDNTROAST THE PUDDING AND STUFF THE TURKEY WITH RAISINS LET ALONE BILINOF IT IN A CLOTH
MR

 TWO EASYCHAIRSSTOOD SIDE BY SIDE AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE IN WHICH SAT BETH AND HERFATHER FEASTING MODESTLY ON CHICKEN AND A LITTLE FRUIT
 THEY DRANKHEALTHS TOLD STORIES SUNG SONGS REMINISCED AS THE OLD FOLKS SAYAND HAD A THOROUGHLY GOOD TIME
 A SLEIGHRIDE HAD BEEN PLANNED BUT THEGIRLS WOULD NOT LEAVE THEIR FATHER SO THE GUESTS DEPARTED EARLY ANDAS TWILIGHT GATHERED THE HAPPY FAMILY SAT TOGETHER ROUND THE FIRE

 MARCHLOOKING WITH FATHERLY SATISFACTION AT THE FOUR YOUNG FACES GATHEREDROUND HIM
HOW DO YOU KNOW
 DID MOTHER TELL YOU
 ASKED JO
NOT MUCH STRAWS SHOW WHICH WAY THE WIND BLOWS AND IVE MADE SEVERALDISCOVERIES TODAY
OH TELL US WHAT THEY ARE
 CRIED MEG WHO SAT BESIDE HIM
HERE IS ONE AND TAKING UP THE HAND WHICH LAY ON THE ARM OF HIS CHAIRHE POINTED TO THE ROUGHENED FOREFINGER A BURN ON THE BACK AND TWO ORTHREE LITTLE HARD SPOTS ON THE PALM
 I REMEMBER A TIME WHEN THIS HANDWAS WHITE AND SMOOTH AND YOUR FIRST CARE WAS TO KEEP IT SO
 IT WAS VERYPRETTY THEN BUT TO ME IT IS MUCH PRETTIER NOWFOR IN THESE SEEMINGBLEMISHES I READ A LITTLE HISTORY
 A BURNTOFFERING HAS BEEN MADE OFVANITY THIS HARDENED PALM HAS EARNED SOMETHING BETTER THAN BLISTERSAND IM SURE THE SEWING DONE BY THESE PRICKED FINGERS WILL LAST A LONGTIME SO MUCH GOODWILL WENT INTO THE STITCHES
 MEG MY DEAR I VALUETHE WOMANLY SKILL WHICH KEEPS HOME HAPPY MORE THAN WHITE HANDS ORFASHIONABLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS
 IM PROUD TO SHAKE THIS GOOD INDUSTRIOUSLITTLE HAND AND HOPE I SHALL NOT SOON BE ASKED TO GIVE IT AWAY
IF MEG HAD WANTED A REWARD FOR HOURS OF PATIENT LABOR SHE RECEIVED ITIN THE HEARTY PRESSURE OF HER FATHERS HAND AND THE APPROVING SMILE HEGAVE HER
WHAT ABOUT JO
 PLEASE SAY SOMETHING NICE FOR SHE HAS TRIED SO HARDAND BEEN SO VERY VERY GOOD TO ME SAID BETH IN HER FATHERS EAR
HE LAUGHED AND LOOKED ACROSS AT THE TALL GIRL WHO SAT OPPOSITE WITH ANUNUSUALLY MILD EXPRESSION IN HER BROWN FACE
IN SPITE OF THE CURLY CROP I DONT SEE THE SON JO WHOM I LEFT A YEARAGO SAID MR
 MARCH
 I SEE A YOUNG LADY WHO PINS HER COLLAR STRAIGHTLACES HER BOOTS NEATLY AND NEITHER WHISTLES TALKS SLANG NOR LIES ONTHE RUG AS SHE USED TO DO
 HER FACE IS RATHER THIN AND PALE JUST NOWWITH WATCHING AND ANXIETY BUT I LIKE TO LOOK AT IT FOR IT HAS GROWNGENTLER AND HER VOICE IS LOWER SHE DOESNT BOUNCE BUT MOVES QUIETLYAND TAKES CARE OF A CERTAIN LITTLE PERSON IN A MOTHERLY WAY WHICHDELIGHTS ME
 I RATHER MISS MY WILD GIRL BUT IF I GET A STRONG HELPFULTENDERHEARTED WOMAN IN HER PLACE I SHALL FEEL QUITE SATISFIED
 I DONTKNOW WHETHER THE SHEARING SOBERED OUR BLACK SHEEP BUT I DO KNOW THAT INALL WASHINGTON I COULDNT FIND ANYTHING BEAUTIFUL ENOUGH TO BE BOUGHTWITH THE FIVEANDTWENTY DOLLARS WHICH MY GOOD GIRL SENT ME
JOS KEEN EYES WERE RATHER DIM FOR A MINUTE AND HER THIN FACE GREW ROSYIN THE FIRELIGHT AS SHE RECEIVED HER FATHERS PRAISE FEELING THAT SHEDID DESERVE A PORTION OF IT

 I ALSO OBSERVE THAT SHE DOESNOT FRET MUCH NOR LOOK IN THE GLASS AND HAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED A VERYPRETTY RING WHICH SHE WEARS SO I CONCLUDE THAT SHE HAS LEARNED TO THINKOF OTHER PEOPLE MORE AND OF HERSELF LESS AND HAS DECIDED TO TRY ANDMOULD HER CHARACTER AS CAREFULLY AS SHE MOULDS HER LITTLE CLAY FIGURES
I AM GLAD OF THIS FOR THOUGH I SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF A GRACEFULSTATUE MADE BY HER I SHALL BE INFINITELY PROUDER OF A LOVABLE DAUGHTERWITH A TALENT FOR MAKING LIFE BEAUTIFUL TO HERSELF AND OTHERS
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF BETH

I THINK NOT FOR I MIGHT SEE SOMETHING SAD AND EVERY ONE LOOKS SOHAPPY NOW I DONT BELIEVE THEY COULD BE MUCH IMPROVED AND JOS EYESWENT SLOWLY ROUND THE ROOM BRIGHTENING AS THEY LOOKED FOR THE PROSPECTWAS A PLEASANT ONE
FATHER AND MOTHER SAT TOGETHER QUIETLY RELIVING THE FIRST CHAPTER OFTHE ROMANCE WHICH FOR THEM BEGAN SOME TWENTY YEARS AGO
 AMY WAS DRAWINGTHE LOVERS WHO SAT APART IN A BEAUTIFUL WORLD OF THEIR OWN THE LIGHTOF WHICH TOUCHED THEIR FACES WITH A GRACE THE LITTLE ARTIST COULD NOTCOPY
 BETH LAY ON HER SOFA TALKING CHEERILY WITH HER OLD FRIEND WHOHELD HER LITTLE HAND AS IF HE FELT THAT IT POSSESSED THE POWER TO LEADHIM ALONG THE PEACEFUL WAY SHE WALKED
 JO LOUNGED IN HER FAVORITE LOWSEAT WITH THE GRAVE QUIET LOOK WHICH BEST BECAME HER AND LAURIELEANING ON THE BACK OF HER CHAIR HIS CHIN ON A LEVEL WITH HER CURLYHEAD SMILED WITH HIS FRIENDLIEST ASPECT AND NODDED AT HER IN THE LONGGLASS WHICH REFLECTED THEM BOTH
                                               SO GROUPED THE CURTAIN FALLS UPON MEG JO BETH AND AMY
 WHETHER ITEVER RISES AGAIN DEPENDS UPON THE RECEPTION GIVEN TO THE FIRST ACT OFTHE DOMESTIC DRAMA CALLED LITTLE WOMEN
                ILLUSTRATION HOME OF THE LITTLE WOMEN                            THE SECOND PART                     ILLUSTRATION THE DOVE COTE                                 XXIV
                                GOSSIP
IN ORDER THAT WE MAY START AFRESH AND GO TO MEGS WEDDING WITH FREEMINDS IT WILL BE WELL TO BEGIN WITH A LITTLE GOSSIP ABOUT THE MARCHES
AND HERE LET ME PREMISE THAT IF ANY OF THE ELDERS THINK THERE IS TOOMUCH LOVERING IN THE STORY AS I FEAR THEY MAY IM NOT AFRAID THEYOUNG FOLKS WILL MAKE THAT OBJECTION I CAN ONLY SAY WITH MRS
 MARCHWHAT CAN YOU EXPECT WHEN I HAVE FOUR GAY GIRLS IN THE HOUSE AND ADASHING YOUNG NEIGHBOR OVER THE WAY
THE THREE YEARS THAT HAVE PASSED HAVE BROUGHT BUT FEW CHANGES TO THEQUIET FAMILY
 THE WAR IS OVER AND MR
 MARCH SAFELY AT HOME BUSY WITHHIS BOOKS AND THE SMALL PARISH WHICH FOUND IN HIM A MINISTER BY NATUREAS BY GRACEA QUIET STUDIOUS MAN RICH IN THE WISDOM THAT IS BETTERTHAN LEARNING THE CHARITY WHICH CALLS ALL MANKIND BROTHER THE PIETYTHAT BLOSSOMS INTO CHARACTER MAKING IT AUGUST AND LOVELY
THESE ATTRIBUTES IN SPITE OF POVERTY AND THE STRICT INTEGRITY WHICHSHUT HIM OUT FROM THE MORE WORLDLY SUCCESSES ATTRACTED TO HIM MANYADMIRABLE PERSONS AS NATURALLY AS SWEET HERBS DRAW BEES AND ASNATURALLY HE GAVE THEM THE HONEY INTO WHICH FIFTY YEARS OF HARDEXPERIENCE HAD DISTILLED NO BITTER DROP
 EARNEST YOUNG MEN FOUND THEGRAYHEADED SCHOLAR AS YOUNG AT HEART AS THEY THOUGHTFUL OR TROUBLEDWOMEN INSTINCTIVELY BROUGHT THEIR DOUBTS AND SORROWS TO HIM SURE OFFINDING THE GENTLEST SYMPATHY THE WISEST COUNSEL SINNERS TOLD THEIRSINS TO THE PUREHEARTED OLD MAN AND WERE BOTH REBUKED AND SAVEDGIFTED MEN FOUND A COMPANION IN HIM AMBITIOUS MEN CAUGHT GLIMPSES OFNOBLER AMBITIONS THAN THEIR OWN AND EVEN WORLDLINGS CONFESSED THAT HISBELIEFS WERE BEAUTIFUL AND TRUE ALTHOUGH THEY WOULDNT PAY
TO OUTSIDERS THE FIVE ENERGETIC WOMEN SEEMED TO RULE THE HOUSE AND SOTHEY DID IN MANY THINGS BUT THE QUIET SCHOLAR SITTING AMONG HIS BOOKSWAS STILL THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY THE HOUSEHOLD CONSCIENCE ANCHOR ANDCOMFORTER FOR TO HIM THE BUSY ANXIOUS WOMEN ALWAYS TURNED IN TROUBLOUSTIMES FINDING HIM IN THE TRUEST SENSE OF THOSE SACRED WORDS HUSBANDAND FATHER
THE GIRLS GAVE THEIR HEARTS INTO THEIR MOTHERS KEEPING THEIR SOULSINTO THEIR FATHERS AND TO BOTH PARENTS WHO LIVED AND LABORED SOFAITHFULLY FOR THEM THEY GAVE A LOVE THAT GREW WITH THEIR GROWTH ANDBOUND THEM TENDERLY TOGETHER BY THE SWEETEST TIE WHICH BLESSES LIFE ANDOUTLIVES DEATH
MRS
 MARCH IS AS BRISK AND CHEERY THOUGH RATHER GRAYER THAN WHEN WESAW HER LAST AND JUST NOW SO ABSORBED IN MEGS AFFAIRS THAT THEHOSPITALS AND HOMES STILL FULL OF WOUNDED BOYS AND SOLDIERS WIDOWSDECIDEDLY MISS THE MOTHERLY MISSIONARYS VISITS
JOHN BROOKE DID HIS DUTY MANFULLY FOR A YEAR GOT WOUNDED WAS SENTHOME AND NOT ALLOWED TO RETURN
 HE RECEIVED NO STARS OR BARS BUT HEDESERVED THEM FOR HE CHEERFULLY RISKED ALL HE HAD AND LIFE AND LOVEARE VERY PRECIOUS WHEN BOTH ARE IN FULL BLOOM
 PERFECTLY RESIGNED TO HISDISCHARGE HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO GETTING WELL PREPARING FOR BUSINESSAND EARNING A HOME FOR MEG
 WITH THE GOOD SENSE AND STURDY INDEPENDENCETHAT CHARACTERIZED HIM HE REFUSED MR
 LAURENCES MORE GENEROUS OFFERSAND ACCEPTED THE PLACE OF BOOKKEEPER FEELING BETTER SATISFIED TO BEGINWITH AN HONESTLYEARNED SALARY THAN BY RUNNING ANY RISKS WITH BORROWEDMONEY
MEG HAD SPENT THE TIME IN WORKING AS WELL AS WAITING GROWING WOMANLY INCHARACTER WISE IN HOUSEWIFELY ARTS AND PRETTIER THAN EVER FOR LOVE ISA GREAT BEAUTIFIER
 SHE HAD HER GIRLISH AMBITIONS AND HOPES AND FELTSOME DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE HUMBLE WAY IN WHICH THE NEW LIFE MUST BEGIN
NED MOFFAT HAD JUST MARRIED SALLIE GARDINER AND MEG COULDNT HELPCONTRASTING THEIR FINE HOUSE AND CARRIAGE MANY GIFTS AND SPLENDIDOUTFIT WITH HER OWN AND SECRETLY WISHING SHE COULD HAVE THE SAME
 BUTSOMEHOW ENVY AND DISCONTENT SOON VANISHED WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF ALL THEPATIENT LOVE AND LABOR JOHN HAD PUT INTO THE LITTLE HOME AWAITING HERAND WHEN THEY SAT TOGETHER IN THE TWILIGHT TALKING OVER THEIR SMALLPLANS THE FUTURE ALWAYS GREW SO BEAUTIFUL AND BRIGHT THAT SHE FORGOTSALLIES SPLENDOR AND FELT HERSELF THE RICHEST HAPPIEST GIRL INCHRISTENDOM
JO NEVER WENT BACK TO AUNT MARCH FOR THE OLD LADY TOOK SUCH A FANCY TOAMY THAT SHE BRIBED HER WITH THE OFFER OF DRAWING LESSONS FROM ONE OFTHE BEST TEACHERS GOING AND FOR THE SAKE OF THIS ADVANTAGE AMY WOULDHAVE SERVED A FAR HARDER MISTRESS
 SO SHE GAVE HER MORNINGS TO DUTY HERAFTERNOONS TO PLEASURE AND PROSPERED FINELY
 JO MEANTIME DEVOTEDHERSELF TO LITERATURE AND BETH WHO REMAINED DELICATE LONG AFTER THEFEVER WAS A THING OF THE PAST
 NOT AN INVALID EXACTLY BUT NEVER AGAINTHE ROSY HEALTHY CREATURE SHE HAD BEEN YET ALWAYS HOPEFUL HAPPY ANDSERENE BUSY WITH THE QUIET DUTIES SHE LOVED EVERY ONES FRIEND AND ANANGEL IN THE HOUSE LONG BEFORE THOSE WHO LOVED HER MOST HAD LEARNED TOKNOW IT
AS LONG AS THE SPREAD EAGLE PAID HER A DOLLAR A COLUMN FOR HERRUBBISH AS SHE CALLED IT JO FELT HERSELF A WOMAN OF MEANS AND SPUNHER LITTLE ROMANCES DILIGENTLY
 BUT GREAT PLANS FERMENTED IN HER BUSYBRAIN AND AMBITIOUS MIND AND THE OLD TIN KITCHEN IN THE GARRET HELD ASLOWLY INCREASING PILE OF BLOTTED MANUSCRIPT WHICH WAS ONE DAY TO PLACETHE NAME OF MARCH UPON THE ROLL OF FAME
LAURIE HAVING DUTIFULLY GONE TO COLLEGE TO PLEASE HIS GRANDFATHER WASNOW GETTING THROUGH IT IN THE EASIEST POSSIBLE MANNER TO PLEASEHIMSELF
 A UNIVERSAL FAVORITE THANKS TO MONEY MANNERS MUCH TALENTAND THE KINDEST HEART THAT EVER GOT ITS OWNER INTO SCRAPES BY TRYING TOGET OTHER PEOPLE OUT OF THEM HE STOOD IN GREAT DANGER OF BEING SPOILTAND PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE MANY ANOTHER PROMISING BOY IF HE HADNOT POSSESSED A TALISMAN AGAINST EVIL IN THE MEMORY OF THE KIND OLD MANWHO WAS BOUND UP IN HIS SUCCESS THE MOTHERLY FRIEND WHO WATCHED OVERHIM AS IF HE WERE HER SON AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST BY ANY MEANS THEKNOWLEDGE THAT FOUR INNOCENT GIRLS LOVED ADMIRED AND BELIEVED IN HIMWITH ALL THEIR HEARTS
BEING ONLY A GLORIOUS HUMAN BOY OF COURSE HE FROLICKED AND FLIRTEDGREW DANDIFIED AQUATIC SENTIMENTAL OR GYMNASTIC AS COLLEGE FASHIONSORDAINED HAZED AND WAS HAZED TALKED SLANG AND MORE THAN ONCE CAMEPERILOUSLY NEAR SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION
 BUT AS HIGH SPIRITS AND THELOVE OF FUN WERE THE CAUSES OF THESE PRANKS HE ALWAYS MANAGED TO SAVEHIMSELF BY FRANK CONFESSION HONORABLE ATONEMENT OR THE IRRESISTIBLEPOWER OF PERSUASION WHICH HE POSSESSED IN PERFECTION
 IN FACT HE RATHERPRIDED HIMSELF ON HIS NARROW ESCAPES AND LIKED TO THRILL THE GIRLS WITHGRAPHIC ACCOUNTS OF HIS TRIUMPHS OVER WRATHFUL TUTORS DIGNIFIEDPROFESSORS AND VANQUISHED ENEMIES
 THE MEN OF MY CLASS WERE HEROES INTHE EYES OF THE GIRLS WHO NEVER WEARIED OF THE EXPLOITS OF OURFELLOWS AND WERE FREQUENTLY ALLOWED TO BASK IN THE SMILES OF THESEGREAT CREATURES WHEN LAURIE BROUGHT THEM HOME WITH HIM
AMY ESPECIALLY ENJOYED THIS HIGH HONOR AND BECAME QUITE A BELLE AMONGTHEM FOR HER LADYSHIP EARLY FELT AND LEARNED TO USE THE GIFT OFFASCINATION WITH WHICH SHE WAS ENDOWED
 MEG WAS TOO MUCH ABSORBED IN HERPRIVATE AND PARTICULAR JOHN TO CARE FOR ANY OTHER LORDS OF CREATION ANDBETH TOO SHY TO DO MORE THAN PEEP AT THEM AND WONDER HOW AMY DARED TOORDER THEM ABOUT SO BUT JO FELT QUITE IN HER ELEMENT AND FOUND IT VERYDIFFICULT TO REFRAIN FROM IMITATING THE GENTLEMANLY ATTITUDES PHRASESAND FEATS WHICH SEEMED MORE NATURAL TO HER THAN THE DECORUMS PRESCRIBEDFOR YOUNG LADIES
 THEY ALL LIKED JO IMMENSELY BUT NEVER FELL IN LOVEWITH HER THOUGH VERY FEW ESCAPED WITHOUT PAYING THE TRIBUTE OF ASENTIMENTAL SIGH OR TWO AT AMYS SHRINE
 AND SPEAKING OF SENTIMENTBRINGS US VERY NATURALLY TO THE DOVECOTE
THAT WAS THE NAME OF THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE WHICH MR
 BROOKE HADPREPARED FOR MEGS FIRST HOME
 LAURIE HAD CHRISTENED IT SAYING IT WASHIGHLY APPROPRIATE TO THE GENTLE LOVERS WHO WENT ON TOGETHER LIKE APAIR OF TURTLEDOVES WITH FIRST A BILL AND THEN A COO
 IT WAS A TINYHOUSE WITH A LITTLE GARDEN BEHIND AND A LAWN ABOUT AS BIG AS APOCKETHANDKERCHIEF IN FRONT
 HERE MEG MEANT TO HAVE A FOUNTAINSHRUBBERY AND A PROFUSION OF LOVELY FLOWERS THOUGH JUST AT PRESENTTHE FOUNTAIN WAS REPRESENTED BY A WEATHERBEATEN URN VERY LIKE ADILAPIDATED SLOPBOWL THE SHRUBBERY CONSISTED OF SEVERAL YOUNG LARCHESUNDECIDED WHETHER TO LIVE OR DIE AND THE PROFUSION OF FLOWERS WASMERELY HINTED BY REGIMENTS OF STICKS TO SHOW WHERE SEEDS WERE PLANTED
BUT INSIDE IT WAS ALTOGETHER CHARMING AND THE HAPPY BRIDE SAW NO FAULTFROM GARRET TO CELLAR
 TO BE SURE THE HALL WAS SO NARROW IT WASFORTUNATE THAT THEY HAD NO PIANO FOR ONE NEVER COULD HAVE BEEN GOT INWHOLE THE DININGROOM WAS SO SMALL THAT SIX PEOPLE WERE A TIGHT FITAND THE KITCHEN STAIRS SEEMED BUILT FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OFPRECIPITATING BOTH SERVANTS AND CHINA PELLMELL INTO THE COALBIN
 BUTONCE GET USED TO THESE SLIGHT BLEMISHES AND NOTHING COULD BE MORECOMPLETE FOR GOOD SENSE AND GOOD TASTE HAD PRESIDED OVER THEFURNISHING AND THE RESULT WAS HIGHLY SATISFACTORY
 THERE WERE NOMARBLETOPPED TABLES LONG MIRRORS OR LACE CURTAINS IN THE LITTLEPARLOR BUT SIMPLE FURNITURE PLENTY OF BOOKS A FINE PICTURE OR TWO ASTAND OF FLOWERS IN THE BAYWINDOW AND SCATTERED ALL ABOUT THE PRETTYGIFTS WHICH CAME FROM FRIENDLY HANDS AND WERE THE FAIRER FOR THE LOVINGMESSAGES THEY BROUGHT
I DONT THINK THE PARIAN PSYCHE LAURIE GAVE LOST ANY OF ITS BEAUTYBECAUSE JOHN PUT UP THE BRACKET IT STOOD UPON THAT ANY UPHOLSTERERCOULD HAVE DRAPED THE PLAIN MUSLIN CURTAINS MORE GRACEFULLY THAN AMYSARTISTIC HAND OR THAT ANY STOREROOM WAS EVER BETTER PROVIDED WITH GOODWISHES MERRY WORDS AND HAPPY HOPES THAN THAT IN WHICH JO AND HERMOTHER PUT AWAY MEGS FEW BOXES BARRELS AND BUNDLES AND I AM MORALLYCERTAIN THAT THE SPANDYNEW KITCHEN NEVER COULD HAVE LOOKED SO COSEYAND NEAT IF HANNAH HAD NOT ARRANGED EVERY POT AND PAN A DOZEN TIMESOVER AND LAID THE FIRE ALL READY FOR LIGHTING THE MINUTE MIS
 BROOKECAME HOME
 I ALSO DOUBT IF ANY YOUNG MATRON EVER BEGAN LIFE WITH SORICH A SUPPLY OF DUSTERS HOLDERS AND PIECEBAGS FOR BETH MADE ENOUGHTO LAST TILL THE SILVER WEDDING CAME ROUND AND INVENTED THREEDIFFERENT KINDS OF DISHCLOTHS FOR THE EXPRESS SERVICE OF THE BRIDALCHINA
PEOPLE WHO HIRE ALL THESE THINGS DONE FOR THEM NEVER KNOW WHAT THEYLOSE FOR THE HOMELIEST TASKS GET BEAUTIFIED IF LOVING HANDS DO THEMAND MEG FOUND SO MANY PROOFS OF THIS THAT EVERYTHING IN HER SMALL NESTFROM THE KITCHEN ROLLER TO THE SILVER VASE ON HER PARLOR TABLE WASELOQUENT OF HOME LOVE AND TENDER FORETHOUGHT
WHAT HAPPY TIMES THEY HAD PLANNING TOGETHER WHAT SOLEMN SHOPPINGEXCURSIONS WHAT FUNNY MISTAKES THEY MADE AND WHAT SHOUTS OF LAUGHTERAROSE OVER LAURIES RIDICULOUS BARGAINS
 IN HIS LOVE OF JOKES THISYOUNG GENTLEMAN THOUGH NEARLY THROUGH COLLEGE WAS AS MUCH OF A BOY ASEVER
 HIS LAST WHIM HAD BEEN TO BRING WITH HIM ON HIS WEEKLY VISITSSOME NEW USEFUL AND INGENIOUS ARTICLE FOR THE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER
 NOW ABAG OF REMARKABLE CLOTHESPINS NEXT A WONDERFUL NUTMEGGRATER WHICHFELL TO PIECES AT THE FIRST TRIAL A KNIFECLEANER THAT SPOILT ALL THEKNIVES OR A SWEEPER THAT PICKED THE NAP NEATLY OFF THE CARPET AND LEFTTHE DIRT LABORSAVING SOAP THAT TOOK THE SKIN OFF ONES HANDSINFALLIBLE CEMENTS WHICH STUCK FIRMLY TO NOTHING BUT THE FINGERS OF THEDELUDED BUYER AND EVERY KIND OF TINWARE FROM A TOY SAVINGSBANK FORODD PENNIES TO A WONDERFUL BOILER WHICH WOULD WASH ARTICLES IN ITS OWNSTEAM WITH EVERY PROSPECT OF EXPLODING IN THE PROCESS
IN VAIN MEG BEGGED HIM TO STOP
 JOHN LAUGHED AT HIM AND JO CALLED HIMMR
 TOODLES
 HE WAS POSSESSED WITH A MANIA FOR PATRONIZING YANKEEINGENUITY AND SEEING HIS FRIENDS FITLY FURNISHED FORTH
 SO EACH WEEKBEHELD SOME FRESH ABSURDITY
EVERYTHING WAS DONE AT LAST EVEN TO AMYS ARRANGING DIFFERENT COLOREDSOAPS TO MATCH THE DIFFERENT COLORED ROOMS AND BETHS SETTING THE TABLEFOR THE FIRST MEAL
ARE YOU SATISFIED
 DOES IT SEEM LIKE HOME AND DO YOU FEEL AS IF YOUSHOULD BE HAPPY HERE
 ASKED MRS
 MARCH AS SHE AND HER DAUGHTER WENTTHROUGH THE NEW KINGDOM ARMINARM FOR JUST THEN THEY SEEMED TO CLINGTOGETHER MORE TENDERLY THAN EVER
YES MOTHER PERFECTLY SATISFIED THANKS TO YOU ALL AND SO HAPPYTHAT I CANT TALK ABOUT IT ANSWERED MEG WITH A LOOK THAT WAS BETTERTHAN WORDS
IF SHE ONLY HAD A SERVANT OR TWO IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT SAID AMYCOMING OUT OF THE PARLOR WHERE SHE HAD BEEN TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHERTHE BRONZE MERCURY LOOKED BEST ON THE WHATNOT OR THE MANTLEPIECE
MOTHER AND I HAVE TALKED THAT OVER AND I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO TRYHER WAY FIRST
 THERE WILL BE SO LITTLE TO DO THAT WITH LOTTY TO RUN MYERRANDS AND HELP ME HERE AND THERE I SHALL ONLY HAVE ENOUGH WORK TOKEEP ME FROM GETTING LAZY OR HOMESICK ANSWERED MEG TRANQUILLY
SALLIE MOFFAT HAS FOUR BEGAN AMY
IF MEG HAD FOUR THE HOUSE WOULDNT HOLD THEM AND MASTER AND MISSISWOULD HAVE TO CAMP IN THE GARDEN BROKE IN JO WHO ENVELOPED IN A BIGBLUE PINAFORE WAS GIVING THE LAST POLISH TO THE DOORHANDLES
SALLIE ISNT A POOR MANS WIFE AND MANY MAIDS ARE IN KEEPING WITH HERFINE ESTABLISHMENT
 MEG AND JOHN BEGIN HUMBLY BUT I HAVE A FEELING THATTHERE WILL BE QUITE AS MUCH HAPPINESS IN THE LITTLE HOUSE AS IN THE BIGONE
 ITS A GREAT MISTAKE FOR YOUNG GIRLS LIKE MEG TO LEAVE THEMSELVESNOTHING TO DO BUT DRESS GIVE ORDERS AND GOSSIP
 WHEN I WAS FIRSTMARRIED I USED TO LONG FOR MY NEW CLOTHES TO WEAR OUT OR GET TORN SOTHAT I MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF MENDING THEM FOR I GOT HEARTILY SICKOF DOING FANCY WORK AND TENDING MY POCKET HANDKERCHIEF
WHY DIDNT YOU GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND MAKE MESSES AS SALLIE SAYS SHEDOES TO AMUSE HERSELF THOUGH THEY NEVER TURN OUT WELL AND THESERVANTS LAUGH AT HER SAID MEG
I DID AFTER A WHILE NOT TO MESS BUT TO LEARN OF HANNAH HOW THINGSSHOULD BE DONE THAT MY SERVANTS NEED NOT LAUGH AT ME
 IT WAS PLAYTHEN BUT THERE CAME A TIME WHEN I WAS TRULY GRATEFUL THAT I NOT ONLYPOSSESSED THE WILL BUT THE POWER TO COOK WHOLESOME FOOD FOR MY LITTLEGIRLS AND HELP MYSELF WHEN I COULD NO LONGER AFFORD TO HIRE HELP
 YOUBEGIN AT THE OTHER END MEG DEAR BUT THE LESSONS YOU LEARN NOW WILL BEOF USE TO YOU BY AND BY WHEN JOHN IS A RICHER MAN FOR THE MISTRESS OFA HOUSE HOWEVER SPLENDID SHOULD KNOW HOW WORK OUGHT TO BE DONE IF SHEWISHES TO BE WELL AND HONESTLY SERVED
YES MOTHER IM SURE OF THAT SAID MEG LISTENING RESPECTFULLY TO THELITTLE LECTURE FOR THE BEST OF WOMEN WILL HOLD FORTH UPON THEALLABSORBING SUBJECT OF HOUSEKEEPING
 DO YOU KNOW I LIKE THIS ROOMMOST OF ALL IN MY BABYHOUSE ADDED MEG A MINUTE AFTER AS THEY WENTUPSTAIRS AND SHE LOOKED INTO HER WELLSTORED LINENCLOSET
BETH WAS THERE LAYING THE SNOWY PILES SMOOTHLY ON THE SHELVES ANDEXULTING OVER THE GOODLY ARRAY
 ALL THREE LAUGHED AS MEG SPOKE FOR THATLINENCLOSET WAS A JOKE
 YOU SEE HAVING SAID THAT IF MEG MARRIED THATBROOKE SHE SHOULDNT HAVE A CENT OF HER MONEY AUNT MARCH WAS RATHER INA QUANDARY WHEN TIME HAD APPEASED HER WRATH AND MADE HER REPENT HERVOW
 SHE NEVER BROKE HER WORD AND WAS MUCH EXERCISED IN HER MIND HOW TOGET ROUND IT AND AT LAST DEVISED A PLAN WHEREBY SHE COULD SATISFYHERSELF
 MRS
 CARROL FLORENCES MAMMA WAS ORDERED TO BUY HAVE MADEAND MARKED A GENEROUS SUPPLY OF HOUSE AND TABLE LINEN AND SEND IT ASHER PRESENT ALL OF WHICH WAS FAITHFULLY DONE BUT THE SECRET LEAKEDOUT AND WAS GREATLY ENJOYED BY THE FAMILY FOR AUNT MARCH TRIED TO LOOKUTTERLY UNCONSCIOUS AND INSISTED THAT SHE COULD GIVE NOTHING BUT THEOLDFASHIONED PEARLS LONG PROMISED TO THE FIRST BRIDE
THATS A HOUSEWIFELY TASTE WHICH I AM GLAD TO SEE
 I HAD A YOUNG FRIENDWHO SET UP HOUSEKEEPING WITH SIX SHEETS BUT SHE HAD FINGER BOWLS FORCOMPANY AND THAT SATISFIED HER SAID MRS
 MARCH PATTING THE DAMASKTABLECLOTHS WITH A TRULY FEMININE APPRECIATION OF THEIR FINENESS

LAURIE THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND LAUGHED SO HEARTILY AT THIS ATTACK THATTHE FELTBASIN FELL OFF AND JO WALKED ON IT WHICH INSULT ONLY AFFORDEDHIM AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EXPATIATING ON THE ADVANTAGES OF AROUGHANDREADY COSTUME AS HE FOLDED UP THE MALTREATED HAT AND STUFFEDIT INTO HIS POCKET

THIS UNASSUMING STYLE PROMOTES STUDY THATS WHY WE ADOPT IT RETURNEDLAURIE WHO CERTAINLY COULD NOT BE ACCUSED OF VANITY HAVING VOLUNTARILYSACRIFICED A HANDSOME CURLY CROP TO THE DEMAND FORQUARTEROFANINCHLONG STUBBLE
BY THE WAY JO I THINK THAT LITTLE PARKER IS REALLY GETTING DESPERATEABOUT AMY
 HE TALKS OF HER CONSTANTLY WRITES POETRY AND MOONS ABOUT INA MOST SUSPICIOUS MANNER
 HED BETTER NIP HIS LITTLE PASSION IN THE BUDHADNT HE
 ADDED LAURIE IN A CONFIDENTIAL ELDERBROTHERLY TONE AFTERA MINUTES SILENCE

 MERCY ON US WHAT ARE THE CHILDREN THINKING OF

ITS A FAST AGE AND I DONT KNOW WHAT WE ARE COMING TO MAAM
 YOU AREA MERE INFANT BUT YOULL GO NEXT JO AND WELL BE LEFT LAMENTINGSAID LAURIE SHAKING HIS HEAD OVER THE DEGENERACY OF THE TIMES
DONT BE ALARMED IM NOT ONE OF THE AGREEABLE SORT
 NOBODY WILL WANTME AND ITS A MERCY FOR THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE ONE OLD MAID IN AFAMILY
YOU WONT GIVE ANY ONE A CHANCE SAID LAURIE WITH A SIDELONG GLANCEAND A LITTLE MORE COLOR THAN BEFORE IN HIS SUNBURNT FACE
 YOU WONTSHOW THE SOFT SIDE OF YOUR CHARACTER AND IF A FELLOW GETS A PEEP AT ITBY ACCIDENT AND CANT HELP SHOWING THAT HE LIKES IT YOU TREAT HIM ASMRS
 GUMMIDGE DID HER SWEETHEARTTHROW COLD WATER OVER HIMAND GETSO THORNY NO ONE DARES TOUCH OR LOOK AT YOU
I DONT LIKE THAT SORT OF THING IM TOO BUSY TO BE WORRIED WITHNONSENSE AND I THINK ITS DREADFUL TO BREAK UP FAMILIES SO
 NOW DONTSAY ANY MORE ABOUT IT MEGS WEDDING HAS TURNED ALL OUR HEADS AND WETALK OF NOTHING BUT LOVERS AND SUCH ABSURDITIES
 I DONT WISH TO GETCROSS SO LETS CHANGE THE SUBJECT AND JO LOOKED QUITE READY TO FLINGCOLD WATER ON THE SLIGHTEST PROVOCATION
WHATEVER HIS FEELINGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN LAURIE FOUND A VENT FOR THEM IN ALONG LOW WHISTLE AND THE FEARFUL PREDICTION AS THEY PARTED AT THEGATE MARK MY WORDS JO YOULL GO NEXT
                       ILLUSTRATION TAILPIECE                   ILLUSTRATION THE FIRST WEDDING                                  XXV
                           THE FIRST WEDDING
THE JUNE ROSES OVER THE PORCH WERE AWAKE BRIGHT AND EARLY ON THATMORNING REJOICING WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS IN THE CLOUDLESS SUNSHINE LIKEFRIENDLY LITTLE NEIGHBORS AS THEY WERE
 QUITE FLUSHED WITH EXCITEMENTWERE THEIR RUDDY FACES AS THEY SWUNG IN THE WIND WHISPERING TO ONEANOTHER WHAT THEY HAD SEEN FOR SOME PEEPED IN AT THE DININGROOMWINDOWS WHERE THE FEAST WAS SPREAD SOME CLIMBED UP TO NOD AND SMILE ATTHE SISTERS AS THEY DRESSED THE BRIDE OTHERS WAVED A WELCOME TO THOSEWHO CAME AND WENT ON VARIOUS ERRANDS IN GARDEN PORCH AND HALL ANDALL FROM THE ROSIEST FULLBLOWN FLOWER TO THE PALEST BABYBUD OFFEREDTHEIR TRIBUTE OF BEAUTY AND FRAGRANCE TO THE GENTLE MISTRESS WHO HADLOVED AND TENDED THEM SO LONG
MEG LOOKED VERY LIKE A ROSE HERSELF FOR ALL THAT WAS BEST AND SWEETESTIN HEART AND SOUL SEEMED TO BLOOM INTO HER FACE THAT DAY MAKING IT FAIRAND TENDER WITH A CHARM MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN BEAUTY
 NEITHER SILK LACENOR ORANGEFLOWERS WOULD SHE HAVE
 I DONT WANT TO LOOK STRANGE ORFIXED UP TODAY SHE SAID
 I DONT WANT A FASHIONABLE WEDDING BUTONLY THOSE ABOUT ME WHOM I LOVE AND TO THEM I WISH TO LOOK AND BE MYFAMILIAR SELF
SO SHE MADE HER WEDDING GOWN HERSELF SEWING INTO IT THE TENDER HOPESAND INNOCENT ROMANCES OF A GIRLISH HEART
 HER SISTERS BRAIDED UP HERPRETTY HAIR AND THE ONLY ORNAMENTS SHE WORE WERE THE LILIES OF THEVALLEY WHICH HER JOHN LIKED BEST OF ALL THE FLOWERS THAT GREW
YOU DO LOOK JUST LIKE OUR OWN DEAR MEG ONLY SO VERY SWEET AND LOVELYTHAT I SHOULD HUG YOU IF IT WOULDNT CRUMPLE YOUR DRESS CRIED AMYSURVEYING HER WITH DELIGHT WHEN ALL WAS DONE
THEN I AM SATISFIED
 BUT PLEASE HUG AND KISS ME EVERY ONE AND DONTMIND MY DRESS I WANT A GREAT MANY CRUMPLES OF THIS SORT PUT INTO ITTODAY AND MEG OPENED HER ARMS TO HER SISTERS WHO CLUNG ABOUT HERWITH APRIL FACES FOR A MINUTE FEELING THAT THE NEW LOVE HAD NOT CHANGEDTHE OLD
NOW IM GOING TO TIE JOHNS CRAVAT FOR HIM AND THEN TO STAY A FEWMINUTES WITH FATHER QUIETLY IN THE STUDY AND MEG RAN DOWN TO PERFORMTHESE LITTLE CEREMONIES AND THEN TO FOLLOW HER MOTHER WHEREVER SHEWENT CONSCIOUS THAT IN SPITE OF THE SMILES ON THE MOTHERLY FACE THEREWAS A SECRET SORROW HID IN THE MOTHERLY HEART AT THE FLIGHT OF THE FIRSTBIRD FROM THE NEST
AS THE YOUNGER GIRLS STAND TOGETHER GIVING THE LAST TOUCHES TO THEIRSIMPLE TOILET IT MAY BE A GOOD TIME TO TELL OF A FEW CHANGES WHICHTHREE YEARS HAVE WROUGHT IN THEIR APPEARANCE FOR ALL ARE LOOKING THEIRBEST JUST NOW
JOS ANGLES ARE MUCH SOFTENED SHE HAS LEARNED TO CARRY HERSELF WITHEASE IF NOT GRACE
 THE CURLY CROP HAS LENGTHENED INTO A THICK COILMORE BECOMING TO THE SMALL HEAD ATOP OF THE TALL FIGURE
 THERE IS AFRESH COLOR IN HER BROWN CHEEKS A SOFT SHINE IN HER EYES AND ONLYGENTLE WORDS FALL FROM HER SHARP TONGUE TODAY
BETH HAS GROWN SLENDER PALE AND MORE QUIET THAN EVER THE BEAUTIFULKIND EYES ARE LARGER AND IN THEM LIES AN EXPRESSION THAT SADDENS ONEALTHOUGH IT IS NOT SAD ITSELF
 IT IS THE SHADOW OF PAIN WHICH TOUCHESTHE YOUNG FACE WITH SUCH PATHETIC PATIENCE BUT BETH SELDOM COMPLAINSAND ALWAYS SPEAKS HOPEFULLY OF BEING BETTER SOON
AMY IS WITH TRUTH CONSIDERED THE FLOWER OF THE FAMILY FOR AT SIXTEENSHE HAS THE AIR AND BEARING OF A FULLGROWN WOMANNOT BEAUTIFUL BUTPOSSESSED OF THAT INDESCRIBABLE CHARM CALLED GRACE
 ONE SAW IT IN THELINES OF HER FIGURE THE MAKE AND MOTION OF HER HANDS THE FLOW OF HERDRESS THE DROOP OF HER HAIRUNCONSCIOUS YET HARMONIOUS AND ASATTRACTIVE TO MANY AS BEAUTY ITSELF
 AMYS NOSE STILL AFFLICTED HER FORIT NEVER WOULD GROW GRECIAN SO DID HER MOUTH BEING TOO WIDE ANDHAVING A DECIDED CHIN
 THESE OFFENDING FEATURES GAVE CHARACTER TO HERWHOLE FACE BUT SHE NEVER COULD SEE IT AND CONSOLED HERSELF WITH HERWONDERFULLY FAIR COMPLEXION KEEN BLUE EYES AND CURLS MORE GOLDEN ANDABUNDANT THAN EVER
ALL THREE WORE SUITS OF THIN SILVER GRAY THEIR BEST GOWNS FOR THESUMMER WITH BLUSHROSES IN HAIR AND BOSOM AND ALL THREE LOOKED JUSTWHAT THEY WEREFRESHFACED HAPPYHEARTED GIRLS PAUSING A MOMENT INTHEIR BUSY LIVES TO READ WITH WISTFUL EYES THE SWEETEST CHAPTER IN THEROMANCE OF WOMANHOOD
THERE WERE TO BE NO CEREMONIOUS PERFORMANCES EVERYTHING WAS TO BE ASNATURAL AND HOMELIKE AS POSSIBLE SO WHEN AUNT MARCH ARRIVED SHE WASSCANDALIZED TO SEE THE BRIDE COME RUNNING TO WELCOME AND LEAD HER IN TOFIND THE BRIDEGROOM FASTENING UP A GARLAND THAT HAD FALLEN DOWN AND TOCATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE PATERNAL MINISTER MARCHING UPSTAIRS WITH A GRAVECOUNTENANCE AND A WINEBOTTLE UNDER EACH ARM
UPON MY WORD HERES A STATE OF THINGS
 CRIED THE OLD LADY TAKING THESEAT OF HONOR PREPARED FOR HER AND SETTLING THE FOLDS OF HER LAVENDERMOIRE WITH A GREAT RUSTLE
 YOU OUGHTNT TO BE SEEN TILL THE LASTMINUTE CHILD
IM NOT A SHOW AUNTY AND NO ONE IS COMING TO STARE AT ME TOCRITICISE MY DRESS OR COUNT THE COST OF MY LUNCHEON
 IM TOO HAPPY TOCARE WHAT ANY ONE SAYS OR THINKS AND IM GOING TO HAVE MY LITTLEWEDDING JUST AS I LIKE IT
 JOHN DEAR HERES YOUR HAMMER AND AWAYWENT MEG TO HELP THAT MAN IN HIS HIGHLY IMPROPER EMPLOYMENT
MR
 BROOKE DIDNT EVEN SAY THANK YOU BUT AS HE STOOPED FOR THEUNROMANTIC TOOL HE KISSED HIS LITTLE BRIDE BEHIND THE FOLDINGDOORWITH A LOOK THAT MADE AUNT MARCH WHISK OUT HER POCKETHANDKERCHIEF WITHA SUDDEN DEW IN HER SHARP OLD EYES
A CRASH A CRY AND A LAUGH FROM LAURIE ACCOMPANIED BY THE INDECOROUSEXCLAMATION JUPITER AMMON
 JOS UPSET THE CAKE AGAIN
 CAUSED AMOMENTARY FLURRY WHICH WAS HARDLY OVER WHEN A FLOCK OF COUSINS ARRIVEDAND THE PARTY CAME IN AS BETH USED TO SAY WHEN A CHILD
DONT LET THAT YOUNG GIANT COME NEAR ME HE WORRIES ME WORSE THANMOSQUITOES WHISPERED THE OLD LADY TO AMY AS THE ROOMS FILLED ANDLAURIES BLACK HEAD TOWERED ABOVE THE REST
HE HAS PROMISED TO BE VERY GOOD TODAY AND HE CAN BE PERFECTLYELEGANT IF HE LIKES RETURNED AMY GLIDING AWAY TO WARN HERCULES TOBEWARE OF THE DRAGON WHICH WARNING CAUSED HIM TO HAUNT THE OLD LADYWITH A DEVOTION THAT NEARLY DISTRACTED HER
THERE WAS NO BRIDAL PROCESSION BUT A SUDDEN SILENCE FELL UPON THE ROOMAS MR
 MARCH AND THE YOUNG PAIR TOOK THEIR PLACES UNDER THE GREEN ARCH
MOTHER AND SISTERS GATHERED CLOSE AS IF LOATH TO GIVE MEG UP THEFATHERLY VOICE BROKE MORE THAN ONCE WHICH ONLY SEEMED TO MAKE THESERVICE MORE BEAUTIFUL AND SOLEMN THE BRIDEGROOMS HAND TREMBLEDVISIBLY AND NO ONE HEARD HIS REPLIES BUT MEG LOOKED STRAIGHT UP IN HERHUSBANDS EYES AND SAID I WILL
 WITH SUCH TENDER TRUST IN HER OWNFACE AND VOICE THAT HER MOTHERS HEART REJOICED AND AUNT MARCH SNIFFEDAUDIBLY
JO DID NOT CRY THOUGH SHE WAS VERY NEAR IT ONCE AND WAS ONLY SAVEDFROM A DEMONSTRATION BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT LAURIE WAS STARINGFIXEDLY AT HER WITH A COMICAL MIXTURE OF MERRIMENT AND EMOTION IN HISWICKED BLACK EYES
 BETH KEPT HER FACE HIDDEN ON HER MOTHERS SHOULDERBUT AMY STOOD LIKE A GRACEFUL STATUE WITH A MOST BECOMING RAY OFSUNSHINE TOUCHING HER WHITE FOREHEAD AND THE FLOWER IN HER HAIR
IT WASNT AT ALL THE THING IM AFRAID BUT THE MINUTE SHE WAS FAIRLYMARRIED MEG CRIED THE FIRST KISS FOR MARMEE
 AND TURNING GAVE ITWITH HER HEART ON HER LIPS
 DURING THE NEXT FIFTEEN MINUTES SHE LOOKEDMORE LIKE A ROSE THAN EVER FOR EVERY ONE AVAILED THEMSELVES OF THEIRPRIVILEGES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT FROM MR
 LAURENCE TO OLD HANNAH WHOADORNED WITH A HEADDRESS FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE FELL UPON HERIN THE HALL CRYING WITH A SOB AND A CHUCKLE BLESS YOU DEARY AHUNDRED TIMES
 THE CAKE AINT HURT A MITE AND EVERYTHING LOOKS LOVELY
EVERYBODY CLEARED UP AFTER THAT AND SAID SOMETHING BRILLIANT OR TRIEDTO WHICH DID JUST AS WELL FOR LAUGHTER IS READY WHEN HEARTS ARE LIGHT
THERE WAS NO DISPLAY OF GIFTS FOR THEY WERE ALREADY IN THE LITTLEHOUSE NOR WAS THERE AN ELABORATE BREAKFAST BUT A PLENTIFUL LUNCH OFCAKE AND FRUIT DRESSED WITH FLOWERS
 MR
 LAURENCE AND AUNT MARCHSHRUGGED AND SMILED AT ONE ANOTHER WHEN WATER LEMONADE AND COFFEE WEREFOUND TO BE THE ONLY SORTS OF NECTAR WHICH THE THREE HEBES CARRIEDROUND
 NO ONE SAID ANYTHING HOWEVER TILL LAURIE WHO INSISTED ONSERVING THE BRIDE APPEARED BEFORE HER WITH A LOADED SALVER IN HIS HANDAND A PUZZLED EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE
HAS JO SMASHED ALL THE BOTTLES BY ACCIDENT
 HE WHISPERED OR AM IMERELY LABORING UNDER A DELUSION THAT I SAW SOME LYING ABOUT LOOSE THISMORNING
NO YOUR GRANDFATHER KINDLY OFFERED US HIS BEST AND AUNT MARCHACTUALLY SENT SOME BUT FATHER PUT AWAY A LITTLE FOR BETH ANDDESPATCHED THE REST TO THE SOLDIERS HOME
 YOU KNOW HE THINKS THAT WINESHOULD BE USED ONLY IN ILLNESS AND MOTHER SAYS THAT NEITHER SHE NOR HERDAUGHTERS WILL EVER OFFER IT TO ANY YOUNG MAN UNDER HER ROOF
MEG SPOKE SERIOUSLY AND EXPECTED TO SEE LAURIE FROWN OR LAUGH BUT HEDID NEITHER FOR AFTER A QUICK LOOK AT HER HE SAID IN HIS IMPETUOUSWAY I LIKE THAT
 FOR IVE SEEN ENOUGH HARM DONE TO WISH OTHER WOMENWOULD THINK AS YOU DO
YOU ARE NOT MADE WISE BY EXPERIENCE I HOPE
 AND THERE WAS AN ANXIOUSACCENT IN MEGS VOICE
NO I GIVE YOU MY WORD FOR IT
 DONT THINK TOO WELL OF ME EITHER THISIS NOT ONE OF MY TEMPTATIONS
 BEING BROUGHT UP WHERE WINE IS AS COMMONAS WATER AND ALMOST AS HARMLESS I DONT CARE FOR IT BUT WHEN A PRETTYGIRL OFFERS IT ONE DOESNT LIKE TO REFUSE YOU SEE
BUT YOU WILL FOR THE SAKE OF OTHERS IF NOT FOR YOUR OWN
 COMELAURIE PROMISE AND GIVE ME ONE MORE REASON TO CALL THIS THE HAPPIESTDAY OF MY LIFE
A DEMAND SO SUDDEN AND SO SERIOUS MADE THE YOUNG MAN HESITATE A MOMENTFOR RIDICULE IS OFTEN HARDER TO BEAR THAN SELFDENIAL
 MEG KNEW THAT IFHE GAVE THE PROMISE HE WOULD KEEP IT AT ALL COSTS AND FEELING HERPOWER USED IT AS A WOMAN MAY FOR HER FRIENDS GOOD
 SHE DID NOT SPEAKBUT SHE LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH A FACE MADE VERY ELOQUENT BY HAPPINESSAND A SMILE WHICH SAID NO ONE CAN REFUSE ME ANYTHING TODAY
 LAURIECERTAINLY COULD NOT AND WITH AN ANSWERING SMILE HE GAVE HER HIS HANDSAYING HEARTILY I PROMISE MRS
 BROOKE
I THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH

SO THE TOAST WAS DRUNK THE PLEDGE MADE AND LOYALLY KEPT IN SPITE OFMANY TEMPTATIONS FOR WITH INSTINCTIVE WISDOM THE GIRLS HAD SEIZED AHAPPY MOMENT TO DO THEIR FRIEND A SERVICE FOR WHICH HE THANKED THEM ALLHIS LIFE
AFTER LUNCH PEOPLE STROLLED ABOUT BY TWOS AND THREES THROUGH HOUSEAND GARDEN ENJOYING THE SUNSHINE WITHOUT AND WITHIN
 MEG AND JOHNHAPPENED TO BE STANDING TOGETHER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GRASSPLOT WHENLAURIE WAS SEIZED WITH AN INSPIRATION WHICH PUT THE FINISHING TOUCH TOTHIS UNFASHIONABLE WEDDING
ALL THE MARRIED PEOPLE TAKE HANDS AND DANCE ROUND THE NEWMADE HUSBANDAND WIFE AS THE GERMANS DO WHILE WE BACHELORS AND SPINSTERS PRANCE INCOUPLES OUTSIDE

                           ARTISTIC ATTEMPTS
IT TAKES PEOPLE A LONG TIME TO LEARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TALENT ANDGENIUS ESPECIALLY AMBITIOUS YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN
 AMY WAS LEARNING THISDISTINCTION THROUGH MUCH TRIBULATION FOR MISTAKING ENTHUSIASM FORINSPIRATION SHE ATTEMPTED EVERY BRANCH OF ART WITH YOUTHFUL AUDACITY
FOR A LONG TIME THERE WAS A LULL IN THE MUDPIE BUSINESS AND SHEDEVOTED HERSELF TO THE FINEST PENANDINK DRAWING IN WHICH SHE SHOWEDSUCH TASTE AND SKILL THAT HER GRACEFUL HANDIWORK PROVED BOTH PLEASANTAND PROFITABLE
 BUT OVERSTRAINED EYES SOON CAUSED PEN AND INK TO BE LAIDASIDE FOR A BOLD ATTEMPT AT POKERSKETCHING
 WHILE THIS ATTACK LASTEDTHE FAMILY LIVED IN CONSTANT FEAR OF A CONFLAGRATION FOR THE ODOR OFBURNING WOOD PERVADED THE HOUSE AT ALL HOURS SMOKE ISSUED FROM ATTICAND SHED WITH ALARMING FREQUENCY REDHOT POKERS LAY ABOUTPROMISCUOUSLY AND HANNAH NEVER WENT TO BED WITHOUT A PAIL OF WATER ANDTHE DINNERBELL AT HER DOOR IN CASE OF FIRE
 RAPHAELS FACE WAS FOUNDBOLDLY EXECUTED ON THE UNDER SIDE OF THE MOULDINGBOARD AND BACCHUS ONTHE HEAD OF A BEERBARREL A CHANTING CHERUB ADORNED THE COVER OF THESUGARBUCKET AND ATTEMPTS TO PORTRAY ROMEO AND JULIET SUPPLIEDKINDLINGS FOR SOME TIME
FROM FIRE TO OIL WAS A NATURAL TRANSITION FOR BURNT FINGERS AND AMYFELL TO PAINTING WITH UNDIMINISHED ARDOR
 AN ARTIST FRIEND FITTED HEROUT WITH HIS CASTOFF PALETTES BRUSHES AND COLORS AND SHE DAUBEDAWAY PRODUCING PASTORAL AND MARINE VIEWS SUCH AS WERE NEVER SEEN ONLAND OR SEA
 HER MONSTROSITIES IN THE WAY OF CATTLE WOULD HAVE TAKENPRIZES AT AN AGRICULTURAL FAIR AND THE PERILOUS PITCHING OF HER VESSELSWOULD HAVE PRODUCED SEASICKNESS IN THE MOST NAUTICAL OBSERVER IF THEUTTER DISREGARD TO ALL KNOWN RULES OF SHIPBUILDING AND RIGGING HAD NOTCONVULSED HIM WITH LAUGHTER AT THE FIRST GLANCE
 SWARTHY BOYS ANDDARKEYED MADONNAS STARING AT YOU FROM ONE CORNER OF THE STUDIOSUGGESTED MURILLO OILYBROWN SHADOWS OF FACES WITH A LURID STREAK INTHE WRONG PLACE MEANT REMBRANDT BUXOM LADIES AND DROPSICAL INFANTSRUBENS AND TURNER APPEARED IN TEMPESTS OF BLUE THUNDER ORANGELIGHTNING BROWN RAIN AND PURPLE CLOUDS WITH A TOMATOCOLORED SPLASHIN THE MIDDLE WHICH MIGHT BE THE SUN OR A BUOY A SAILORS SHIRT OR AKINGS ROBE AS THE SPECTATOR PLEASED
CHARCOAL PORTRAITS CAME NEXT AND THE ENTIRE FAMILY HUNG IN A ROWLOOKING AS WILD AND CROCKY AS IF JUST EVOKED FROM A COALBIN
 SOFTENEDINTO CRAYON SKETCHES THEY DID BETTER FOR THE LIKENESSES WERE GOOD ANDAMYS HAIR JOS NOSE MEGS MOUTH AND LAURIES EYES WERE PRONOUNCEDWONDERFULLY FINE
 A RETURN TO CLAY AND PLASTER FOLLOWED AND GHOSTLYCASTS OF HER ACQUAINTANCES HAUNTED CORNERS OF THE HOUSE OR TUMBLED OFFCLOSETSHELVES ON TO PEOPLES HEADS
 CHILDREN WERE ENTICED IN AS MODELSTILL THEIR INCOHERENT ACCOUNTS OF HER MYSTERIOUS DOINGS CAUSED MISS AMYTO BE REGARDED IN THE LIGHT OF A YOUNG OGRESS
 HER EFFORTS IN THIS LINEHOWEVER WERE BROUGHT TO AN ABRUPT CLOSE BY AN UNTOWARD ACCIDENT WHICHQUENCHED HER ARDOR
 OTHER MODELS FAILING HER FOR A TIME SHE UNDERTOOKTO CAST HER OWN PRETTY FOOT AND THE FAMILY WERE ONE DAY ALARMED BY ANUNEARTHLY BUMPING AND SCREAMING AND RUNNING TO THE RESCUE FOUND THEYOUNG ENTHUSIAST HOPPING WILDLY ABOUT THE SHED WITH HER FOOT HELD FASTIN A PANFULL OF PLASTER WHICH HAD HARDENED WITH UNEXPECTED RAPIDITY
WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY AND SOME DANGER SHE WAS DUG OUT FOR JO WAS SOOVERCOME WITH LAUGHTER WHILE SHE EXCAVATED THAT HER KNIFE WENT TOO FARCUT THE POOR FOOT AND LEFT A LASTING MEMORIAL OF ONE ARTISTIC ATTEMPTAT LEAST
       ILLUSTRATION HER FOOT HELD FAST IN A PANFUL OF PLASTERAFTER THIS AMY SUBSIDED TILL A MANIA FOR SKETCHING FROM NATURE SET HERTO HAUNTING RIVER FIELD AND WOOD FOR PICTURESQUE STUDIES AND SIGHINGFOR RUINS TO COPY
 SHE CAUGHT ENDLESS COLDS SITTING ON DAMP GRASS TOBOOK A DELICIOUS BIT COMPOSED OF A STONE A STUMP ONE MUSHROOM ANDA BROKEN MULLEINSTALK OR A HEAVENLY MASS OF CLOUDS THAT LOOKED LIKEA CHOICE DISPLAY OF FEATHERBEDS WHEN DONE
 SHE SACRIFICED HERCOMPLEXION FLOATING ON THE RIVER IN THE MIDSUMMER SUN TO STUDY LIGHTAND SHADE AND GOT A WRINKLE OVER HER NOSE TRYING AFTER POINTS OFSIGHT OR WHATEVER THE SQUINTANDSTRING PERFORMANCE IS CALLED
IF GENIUS IS ETERNAL PATIENCE AS MICHAEL ANGELO AFFIRMS AMYCERTAINLY HAD SOME CLAIM TO THE DIVINE ATTRIBUTE FOR SHE PERSEVERED INSPITE OF ALL OBSTACLES FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS FIRMLY BELIEVINGTHAT IN TIME SHE SHOULD DO SOMETHING WORTHY TO BE CALLED HIGH ART
SHE WAS LEARNING DOING AND ENJOYING OTHER THINGS MEANWHILE FOR SHEHAD RESOLVED TO BE AN ATTRACTIVE AND ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN EVEN IF SHENEVER BECAME A GREAT ARTIST
 HERE SHE SUCCEEDED BETTER FOR SHE WAS ONEOF THOSE HAPPILY CREATED BEINGS WHO PLEASE WITHOUT EFFORT MAKE FRIENDSEVERYWHERE AND TAKE LIFE SO GRACEFULLY AND EASILY THAT LESS FORTUNATESOULS ARE TEMPTED TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH ARE BORN UNDER A LUCKY STAR
EVERYBODY LIKED HER FOR AMONG HER GOOD GIFTS WAS TACT
 SHE HAD ANINSTINCTIVE SENSE OF WHAT WAS PLEASING AND PROPER ALWAYS SAID THE RIGHTTHING TO THE RIGHT PERSON DID JUST WHAT SUITED THE TIME AND PLACE ANDWAS SO SELFPOSSESSED THAT HER SISTERS USED TO SAY IF AMY WENT TOCOURT WITHOUT ANY REHEARSAL BEFOREHAND SHED KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO
ONE OF HER WEAKNESSES WAS A DESIRE TO MOVE IN OUR BEST SOCIETYWITHOUT BEING QUITE SURE WHAT THE BEST REALLY WAS
 MONEY POSITIONFASHIONABLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND ELEGANT MANNERS WERE MOST DESIRABLETHINGS IN HER EYES AND SHE LIKED TO ASSOCIATE WITH THOSE WHO POSSESSEDTHEM OFTEN MISTAKING THE FALSE FOR THE TRUE AND ADMIRING WHAT WAS NOTADMIRABLE
 NEVER FORGETTING THAT BY BIRTH SHE WAS A GENTLEWOMAN SHECULTIVATED HER ARISTOCRATIC TASTES AND FEELINGS SO THAT WHEN THEOPPORTUNITY CAME SHE MIGHT BE READY TO TAKE THE PLACE FROM WHICH POVERTYNOW EXCLUDED HER
MY LADY AS HER FRIENDS CALLED HER SINCERELY DESIRED TO BE A GENUINELADY AND WAS SO AT HEART BUT HAD YET TO LEARN THAT MONEY CANNOT BUYREFINEMENT OF NATURE THAT RANK DOES NOT ALWAYS CONFER NOBILITY ANDTHAT TRUE BREEDING MAKES ITSELF FELT IN SPITE OF EXTERNAL DRAWBACKS
I WANT TO ASK A FAVOR OF YOU MAMMA AMY SAID COMING IN WITH ANIMPORTANT AIR ONE DAY
WELL LITTLE GIRL WHAT IS IT
 REPLIED HER MOTHER IN WHOSE EYES THESTATELY YOUNG LADY STILL REMAINED THE BABY

 THEY ARE WILD TOSEE THE RIVER SKETCH THE BROKEN BRIDGE AND COPY SOME OF THE THINGSTHEY ADMIRE IN MY BOOK
 THEY HAVE BEEN VERY KIND TO ME IN MANY WAYS ANDI AM GRATEFUL FOR THEY ARE ALL RICH AND KNOW I AM POOR YET THEY NEVERMADE ANY DIFFERENCE
WHY SHOULD THEY
 AND MRS
 MARCH PUT THE QUESTION WITH WHAT THE GIRLSCALLED HER MARIA THERESA AIR
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I THAT IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE WITH NEARLYEVERY ONE SO DONT RUFFLE UP LIKE A DEAR MOTHERLY HEN WHEN YOURCHICKENS GET PECKED BY SMARTER BIRDS THE UGLY DUCKLING TURNED OUT ASWAN YOU KNOW AND AMY SMILED WITHOUT BITTERNESS FOR SHE POSSESSED AHAPPY TEMPER AND HOPEFUL SPIRIT
MRS

I SHOULD LIKE TO ASK THE GIRLS OUT TO LUNCH NEXT WEEK TO TAKE THEM ADRIVE TO THE PLACES THEY WANT TO SEE A ROW ON THE RIVER PERHAPS ANDMAKE A LITTLE ARTISTIC FÊTE FOR THEM
THAT LOOKS FEASIBLE
 WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR LUNCH
 CAKE SANDWICHESFRUIT AND COFFEE WILL BE ALL THAT IS NECESSARY I SUPPOSE
OH DEAR NO
 WE MUST HAVE COLD TONGUE AND CHICKEN FRENCH CHOCOLATE ANDICECREAM BESIDES
 THE GIRLS ARE USED TO SUCH THINGS AND I WANT MYLUNCH TO BE PROPER AND ELEGANT THOUGH I DO WORK FOR MY LIVING
HOW MANY YOUNG LADIES ARE THERE
 ASKED HER MOTHER BEGINNING TO LOOKSOBER
TWELVE OR FOURTEEN IN THE CLASS BUT I DARE SAY THEY WONT ALL COME
BLESS ME CHILD YOU WILL HAVE TO CHARTER AN OMNIBUS TO CARRY THEMABOUT
WHY MOTHER HOW CAN YOU THINK OF SUCH A THING
 NOT MORE THAN SIX OREIGHT WILL PROBABLY COME SO I SHALL HIRE A BEACHWAGON AND BORROW MR
LAURENCES CHERRYBOUNCE
 HANNAHS PRONUNCIATION OF CHARÀBANC
ALL THIS WILL BE EXPENSIVE AMY
NOT VERY IVE CALCULATED THE COST AND ILL PAY FOR IT MYSELF
DONT YOU THINK DEAR THAT AS THESE GIRLS ARE USED TO SUCH THINGS ANDTHE BEST WE CAN DO WILL BE NOTHING NEW THAT SOME SIMPLER PLAN WOULD BEPLEASANTER TO THEM AS A CHANGE IF NOTHING MORE AND MUCH BETTER FOR USTHAN BUYING OR BORROWING WHAT WE DONT NEED AND ATTEMPTING A STYLE NOTIN KEEPING WITH OUR CIRCUMSTANCES
IF I CANT HAVE IT AS I LIKE I DONT CARE TO HAVE IT AT ALL
 I KNOWTHAT I CAN CARRY IT OUT PERFECTLY WELL IF YOU AND THE GIRLS WILL HELPA LITTLE AND I DONT SEE WHY I CANT IF IM WILLING TO PAY FOR ITSAID AMY WITH THE DECISION WHICH OPPOSITION WAS APT TO CHANGE INTOOBSTINACY
MRS
 MARCH KNEW THAT EXPERIENCE WAS AN EXCELLENT TEACHER AND WHEN ITWAS POSSIBLE SHE LEFT HER CHILDREN TO LEARN ALONE THE LESSONS WHICH SHEWOULD GLADLY HAVE MADE EASIER IF THEY HAD NOT OBJECTED TO TAKING ADVICEAS MUCH AS THEY DID SALTS AND SENNA
VERY WELL AMY IF YOUR HEART IS SET UPON IT AND YOU SEE YOUR WAYTHROUGH WITHOUT TOO GREAT AN OUTLAY OF MONEY TIME AND TEMPER ILL SAYNO MORE
 TALK IT OVER WITH THE GIRLS AND WHICHEVER WAY YOU DECIDE ILLDO MY BEST TO HELP YOU
THANKS MOTHER YOU ARE ALWAYS SO KIND AND AWAY WENT AMY TO LAY HERPLAN BEFORE HER SISTERS
MEG AGREED AT ONCE AND PROMISED HER AID GLADLY OFFERING ANYTHING SHEPOSSESSED FROM HER LITTLE HOUSE ITSELF TO HER VERY BEST SALTSPOONS
BUT JO FROWNED UPON THE WHOLE PROJECT AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITHIT AT FIRST
WHY IN THE WORLD SHOULD YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY WORRY YOUR FAMILY ANDTURN THE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN FOR A PARCEL OF GIRLS WHO DONT CARE ASIXPENCE FOR YOU
 I THOUGHT YOU HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE AND SENSE TO TRUCKLETO ANY MORTAL WOMAN JUST BECAUSE SHE WEARS FRENCH BOOTS AND RIDES IN ACOUPÉ SAID JO WHO BEING CALLED FROM THE TRAGICAL CLIMAX OF HERNOVEL WAS NOT IN THE BEST MOOD FOR SOCIAL ENTERPRISES
I DONT TRUCKLE AND I HATE BEING PATRONIZED AS MUCH AS YOU DO
RETURNED AMY INDIGNANTLY FOR THE TWO STILL JANGLED WHEN SUCH QUESTIONSAROSE
 THE GIRLS DO CARE FOR ME AND I FOR THEM AND THERES A GREATDEAL OF KINDNESS AND SENSE AND TALENT AMONG THEM IN SPITE OF WHAT YOUCALL FASHIONABLE NONSENSE
 YOU DONT CARE TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU TO GOINTO GOOD SOCIETY AND CULTIVATE YOUR MANNERS AND TASTES
 I DO AND IMEAN TO MAKE THE MOST OF EVERY CHANCE THAT COMES
 YOU CAN GO THROUGHTHE WORLD WITH YOUR ELBOWS OUT AND YOUR NOSE IN THE AIR AND CALL ITINDEPENDENCE IF YOU LIKE
 THATS NOT MY WAY
WHEN AMY WHETTED HER TONGUE AND FREED HER MIND SHE USUALLY GOT THE BESTOF IT FOR SHE SELDOM FAILED TO HAVE COMMON SENSE ON HER SIDE WHILE JOCARRIED HER LOVE OF LIBERTY AND HATE OF CONVENTIONALITIES TO SUCH ANUNLIMITED EXTENT THAT SHE NATURALLY FOUND HERSELF WORSTED IN ANARGUMENT
 AMYS DEFINITION OF JOS IDEA OF INDEPENDENCE WAS SUCH A GOODHIT THAT BOTH BURST OUT LAUGHING AND THE DISCUSSION TOOK A MORE AMIABLETURN
 MUCH AGAINST HER WILL JO AT LENGTH CONSENTED TO SACRIFICE A DAYTO MRS
 GRUNDY AND HELP HER SISTER THROUGH WHAT SHE REGARDED AS ANONSENSICAL BUSINESS
THE INVITATIONS WERE SENT NEARLY ALL ACCEPTED AND THE FOLLOWING MONDAYWAS SET APART FOR THE GRAND EVENT
 HANNAH WAS OUT OF HUMOR BECAUSE HERWEEKS WORK WAS DERANGED AND PROPHESIED THAT EF THE WASHIN ANDIRONIN WARNT DONE REGLAR NOTHIN WOULD GO WELL ANYWHERES
 THIS HITCHIN THE MAINSPRING OF THE DOMESTIC MACHINERY HAD A BAD EFFECT UPON THEWHOLE CONCERN BUT AMYS MOTTO WAS NIL DESPERANDUM AND HAVING MADE UPHER MIND WHAT TO DO SHE PROCEEDED TO DO IT IN SPITE OF ALL OBSTACLES
TO BEGIN WITH HANNAHS COOKING DIDNT TURN OUT WELL THE CHICKEN WASTOUGH THE TONGUE TOO SALT AND THE CHOCOLATE WOULDNT FROTH PROPERLY
THEN THE CAKE AND ICE COST MORE THAN AMY EXPECTED SO DID THE WAGON ANDVARIOUS OTHER EXPENSES WHICH SEEMED TRIFLING AT THE OUTSET COUNTED UPRATHER ALARMINGLY AFTERWARD
 BETH GOT COLD AND TOOK TO HER BED MEG HADAN UNUSUAL NUMBER OF CALLERS TO KEEP HER AT HOME AND JO WAS IN SUCH ADIVIDED STATE OF MIND THAT HER BREAKAGES ACCIDENTS AND MISTAKES WEREUNCOMMONLY NUMEROUS SERIOUS AND TRYING
IF IT HADNT BEEN FOR MOTHER I NEVER SHOULD HAVE GOT THROUGH AS AMYDECLARED AFTERWARD AND GRATEFULLY REMEMBERED WHEN THE BEST JOKE OF THESEASON WAS ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN BY EVERYBODY ELSE
IF IT WAS NOT FAIR ON MONDAY THE YOUNG LADIES WERE TO COME ONTUESDAYAN ARRANGEMENT WHICH AGGRAVATED JO AND HANNAH TO THE LASTDEGREE
 ON MONDAY MORNING THE WEATHER WAS IN THAT UNDECIDED STATE WHICHIS MORE EXASPERATING THAN A STEADY POUR
 IT DRIZZLED A LITTLE SHONE ALITTLE BLEW A LITTLE AND DIDNT MAKE UP ITS MIND TILL IT WAS TOO LATEFOR ANY ONE ELSE TO MAKE UP THEIRS
 AMY WAS UP AT DAWN HUSTLING PEOPLEOUT OF THEIR BEDS AND THROUGH THEIR BREAKFASTS THAT THE HOUSE MIGHT BEGOT IN ORDER
 THE PARLOR STRUCK HER AS LOOKING UNCOMMONLY SHABBY BUTWITHOUT STOPPING TO SIGH FOR WHAT SHE HAD NOT SHE SKILFULLY MADE THEBEST OF WHAT SHE HAD ARRANGING CHAIRS OVER THE WORN PLACES IN THECARPET COVERING STAINS ON THE WALLS WITH PICTURES FRAMED IN IVY ANDFILLING UP EMPTY CORNERS WITH HOMEMADE STATUARY WHICH GAVE AN ARTISTICAIR TO THE ROOM AS DID THE LOVELY VASES OF FLOWERS JO SCATTERED ABOUT
THE LUNCH LOOKED CHARMINGLY AND AS SHE SURVEYED IT SHE SINCERELY HOPEDIT WOULD TASTE WELL AND THAT THE BORROWED GLASS CHINA AND SILVERWOULD GET SAFELY HOME AGAIN
 THE CARRIAGES WERE PROMISED MEG AND MOTHERWERE ALL READY TO DO THE HONORS BETH WAS ABLE TO HELP HANNAH BEHIND THESCENES JO HAD ENGAGED TO BE AS LIVELY AND AMIABLE AS AN ABSENT MIND ANACHING HEAD AND A VERY DECIDED DISAPPROVAL OF EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHINGWOULD ALLOW AND AS SHE WEARILY DRESSED AMY CHEERED HERSELF WITHANTICIPATIONS OF THE HAPPY MOMENT WHEN LUNCH SAFELY OVER SHE SHOULDDRIVE AWAY WITH HER FRIENDS FOR AN AFTERNOON OF ARTISTIC DELIGHTS FORTHE CHERRYBOUNCE AND THE BROKEN BRIDGE WERE HER STRONG POINTS
THEN CAME TWO HOURS OF SUSPENSE DURING WHICH SHE VIBRATED FROM PARLORTO PORCH WHILE PUBLIC OPINION VARIED LIKE THE WEATHERCOCK
 A SMARTSHOWER AT ELEVEN HAD EVIDENTLY QUENCHED THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE YOUNGLADIES WHO WERE TO ARRIVE AT TWELVE FOR NOBODY CAME AND AT TWO THEEXHAUSTED FAMILY SAT DOWN IN A BLAZE OF SUNSHINE TO CONSUME THEPERISHABLE PORTIONS OF THE FEAST THAT NOTHING MIGHT BE LOST
NO DOUBT ABOUT THE WEATHER TODAY THEY WILL CERTAINLY COME SO WE MUSTFLY ROUND AND BE READY FOR THEM SAID AMY AS THE SUN WOKE HER NEXTMORNING

                           LITERARY LESSONS
FORTUNE SUDDENLY SMILED UPON JO AND DROPPED A GOODLUCK PENNY IN HERPATH
 NOT A GOLDEN PENNY EXACTLY BUT I DOUBT IF HALF A MILLION WOULDHAVE GIVEN MORE REAL HAPPINESS THAN DID THE LITTLE SUM THAT CAME TO HERIN THIS WISE
EVERY FEW WEEKS SHE WOULD SHUT HERSELF UP IN HER ROOM PUT ON HERSCRIBBLING SUIT AND FALL INTO A VORTEX AS SHE EXPRESSED IT WRITINGAWAY AT HER NOVEL WITH ALL HER HEART AND SOUL FOR TILL THAT WASFINISHED SHE COULD FIND NO PEACE
 HER SCRIBBLING SUIT CONSISTED OF ABLACK WOOLLEN PINAFORE ON WHICH SHE COULD WIPE HER PEN AT WILL AND ACAP OF THE SAME MATERIAL ADORNED WITH A CHEERFUL RED BOW INTO WHICHSHE BUNDLED HER HAIR WHEN THE DECKS WERE CLEARED FOR ACTION
 THIS CAPWAS A BEACON TO THE INQUIRING EYES OF HER FAMILY WHO DURING THESEPERIODS KEPT THEIR DISTANCE MERELY POPPING IN THEIR HEADSSEMIOCCASIONALLY TO ASK WITH INTEREST DOES GENIUS BURN JO
 THEYDID NOT ALWAYS VENTURE EVEN TO ASK THIS QUESTION BUT TOOK ANOBSERVATION OF THE CAP AND JUDGED ACCORDINGLY
 IF THIS EXPRESSIVEARTICLE OF DRESS WAS DRAWN LOW UPON THE FOREHEAD IT WAS A SIGN THATHARD WORK WAS GOING ON IN EXCITING MOMENTS IT WAS PUSHED RAKISHLYASKEW AND WHEN DESPAIR SEIZED THE AUTHOR IT WAS PLUCKED WHOLLY OFF ANDCAST UPON THE FLOOR
 AT SUCH TIMES THE INTRUDER SILENTLY WITHDREW ANDNOT UNTIL THE RED BOW WAS SEEN GAYLY ERECT UPON THE GIFTED BROW DID ANYONE DARE ADDRESS JO
SHE DID NOT THINK HERSELF A GENIUS BY ANY MEANS BUT WHEN THE WRITINGFIT CAME ON SHE GAVE HERSELF UP TO IT WITH ENTIRE ABANDON AND LED ABLISSFUL LIFE UNCONSCIOUS OF WANT CARE OR BAD WEATHER WHILE SHE SATSAFE AND HAPPY IN AN IMAGINARY WORLD FULL OF FRIENDS ALMOST AS REAL ANDDEAR TO HER AS ANY IN THE FLESH
 SLEEP FORSOOK HER EYES MEALS STOODUNTASTED DAY AND NIGHT WERE ALL TOO SHORT TO ENJOY THE HAPPINESS WHICHBLESSED HER ONLY AT SUCH TIMES AND MADE THESE HOURS WORTH LIVING EVENIF THEY BORE NO OTHER FRUIT
 THE DIVINE AFFLATUS USUALLY LASTED A WEEKOR TWO AND THEN SHE EMERGED FROM HER VORTEX HUNGRY SLEEPY CROSSOR DESPONDENT
SHE WAS JUST RECOVERING FROM ONE OF THESE ATTACKS WHEN SHE WAS PREVAILEDUPON TO ESCORT MISS CROCKER TO A LECTURE AND IN RETURN FOR HER VIRTUEWAS REWARDED WITH A NEW IDEA
 IT WAS A PEOPLES COURSE THE LECTURE ONTHE PYRAMIDS AND JO RATHER WONDERED AT THE CHOICE OF SUCH A SUBJECT FORSUCH AN AUDIENCE BUT TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT SOME GREAT SOCIAL EVILWOULD BE REMEDIED OR SOME GREAT WANT SUPPLIED BY UNFOLDING THE GLORIESOF THE PHARAOHS TO AN AUDIENCE WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE BUSY WITH THE PRICEOF COAL AND FLOUR AND WHOSE LIVES WERE SPENT IN TRYING TO SOLVE HARDERRIDDLES THAN THAT OF THE SPHINX
THEY WERE EARLY AND WHILE MISS CROCKER SET THE HEEL OF HER STOCKING JOAMUSED HERSELF BY EXAMINING THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE WHO OCCUPIED THESEAT WITH THEM
 ON HER LEFT WERE TWO MATRONS WITH MASSIVE FOREHEADSAND BONNETS TO MATCH DISCUSSING WOMANS RIGHTS AND MAKING TATTING
BEYOND SAT A PAIR OF HUMBLE LOVERS ARTLESSLY HOLDING EACH OTHER BY THEHAND A SOMBRE SPINSTER EATING PEPPERMINTS OUT OF A PAPER BAG AND ANOLD GENTLEMAN TAKING HIS PREPARATORY NAP BEHIND A YELLOW BANDANNA
 ONHER RIGHT HER ONLY NEIGHBOR WAS A STUDIOUSLOOKING LAD ABSORBED IN ANEWSPAPER
IT WAS A PICTORIAL SHEET AND JO EXAMINED THE WORK OF ART NEAREST HERIDLY WONDERING WHAT UNFORTUITOUS CONCATENATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES NEEDEDTHE MELODRAMATIC ILLUSTRATION OF AN INDIAN IN FULL WAR COSTUME TUMBLINGOVER A PRECIPICE WITH A WOLF AT HIS THROAT WHILE TWO INFURIATED YOUNGGENTLEMEN WITH UNNATURALLY SMALL FEET AND BIG EYES WERE STABBING EACHOTHER CLOSE BY AND A DISHEVELLED FEMALE WAS FLYING AWAY IN THEBACKGROUND WITH HER MOUTH WIDE OPEN
 PAUSING TO TURN A PAGE THE LAD SAWHER LOOKING AND WITH BOYISH GOODNATURE OFFERED HALF HIS PAPERSAYING BLUNTLY WANT TO READ IT
 THATS A FIRSTRATE STORY
JO ACCEPTED IT WITH A SMILE FOR SHE HAD NEVER OUTGROWN HER LIKING FORLADS AND SOON FOUND HERSELF INVOLVED IN THE USUAL LABYRINTH OF LOVEMYSTERY AND MURDER FOR THE STORY BELONGED TO THAT CLASS OF LIGHTLITERATURE IN WHICH THE PASSIONS HAVE A HOLIDAY AND WHEN THE AUTHORSINVENTION FAILS A GRAND CATASTROPHE CLEARS THE STAGE OF ONE HALF THEDRAMATIS PERSONÆ LEAVING THE OTHER HALF TO EXULT OVER THEIR DOWNFALL
PRIME ISNT IT
 ASKED THE BOY AS HER EYE WENT DOWN THE LASTPARAGRAPH OF HER PORTION
I THINK YOU AND I COULD DO AS WELL AS THAT IF WE TRIED RETURNED JOAMUSED AT HIS ADMIRATION OF THE TRASH
I SHOULD THINK I WAS A PRETTY LUCKY CHAP IF I COULD
 SHE MAKES A GOODLIVING OUT OF SUCH STORIES THEY SAY AND HE POINTED TO THE NAME OFMRS
 S
 L
 A
 N
 G
 NORTHBURY UNDER THE TITLE OF THE TALE
DO YOU KNOW HER
 ASKED JO WITH SUDDEN INTEREST
NO BUT I READ ALL HER PIECES AND I KNOW A FELLOW WHO WORKS IN THEOFFICE WHERE THIS PAPER IS PRINTED
DO YOU SAY SHE MAKES A GOOD LIVING OUT OF STORIES LIKE THIS
 AND JOLOOKED MORE RESPECTFULLY AT THE AGITATED GROUP AND THICKLYSPRINKLEDEXCLAMATIONPOINTS THAT ADORNED THE PAGE
GUESS SHE DOES
 SHE KNOWS JUST WHAT FOLKS LIKE AND GETS PAID WELL FORWRITING IT
HERE THE LECTURE BEGAN BUT JO HEARD VERY LITTLE OF IT FOR WHILE PROF
SANDS WAS PROSING AWAY ABOUT BELZONI CHEOPS SCARABEI ANDHIEROGLYPHICS SHE WAS COVERTLY TAKING DOWN THE ADDRESS OF THE PAPERAND BOLDLY RESOLVING TO TRY FOR THE HUNDREDDOLLAR PRIZE OFFERED IN ITSCOLUMNS FOR A SENSATIONAL STORY
 BY THE TIME THE LECTURE ENDED AND THEAUDIENCE AWOKE SHE HAD BUILT UP A SPLENDID FORTUNE FOR HERSELF NOT THEFIRST FOUNDED UPON PAPER AND WAS ALREADY DEEP IN THE CONCOCTION OF HERSTORY BEING UNABLE TO DECIDE WHETHER THE DUEL SHOULD COME BEFORE THEELOPEMENT OR AFTER THE MURDER
SHE SAID NOTHING OF HER PLAN AT HOME BUT FELL TO WORK NEXT DAY MUCH TOTHE DISQUIET OF HER MOTHER WHO ALWAYS LOOKED A LITTLE ANXIOUS WHENGENIUS TOOK TO BURNING
 JO HAD NEVER TRIED THIS STYLE BEFORECONTENTING HERSELF WITH VERY MILD ROMANCES FOR THE SPREAD EAGLE
 HERTHEATRICAL EXPERIENCE AND MISCELLANEOUS READING WERE OF SERVICE NOW FORTHEY GAVE HER SOME IDEA OF DRAMATIC EFFECT AND SUPPLIED PLOT LANGUAGEAND COSTUMES
 HER STORY WAS AS FULL OF DESPERATION AND DESPAIR AS HERLIMITED ACQUAINTANCE WITH THOSE UNCOMFORTABLE EMOTIONS ENABLED HER TOMAKE IT AND HAVING LOCATED IT IN LISBON SHE WOUND UP WITH ANEARTHQUAKE AS A STRIKING AND APPROPRIATE DÉNOUEMENT
 THE MANUSCRIPTWAS PRIVATELY DESPATCHED ACCOMPANIED BY A NOTE MODESTLY SAYING THAT IFTHE TALE DIDNT GET THE PRIZE WHICH THE WRITER HARDLY DARED EXPECT SHEWOULD BE VERY GLAD TO RECEIVE ANY SUM IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED WORTH
SIX WEEKS IS A LONG TIME TO WAIT AND A STILL LONGER TIME FOR A GIRL TOKEEP A SECRET BUT JO DID BOTH AND WAS JUST BEGINNING TO GIVE UP ALLHOPE OF EVER SEEING HER MANUSCRIPT AGAIN WHEN A LETTER ARRIVED WHICHALMOST TOOK HER BREATH AWAY FOR ON OPENING IT A CHECK FOR A HUNDREDDOLLARS FELL INTO HER LAP
 FOR A MINUTE SHE STARED AT IT AS IF IT HADBEEN A SNAKE THEN SHE READ HER LETTER AND BEGAN TO CRY
 IF THE AMIABLEGENTLEMAN WHO WROTE THAT KINDLY NOTE COULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT INTENSEHAPPINESS HE WAS GIVING A FELLOWCREATURE I THINK HE WOULD DEVOTE HISLEISURE HOURS IF HE HAS ANY TO THAT AMUSEMENT FOR JO VALUED THELETTER MORE THAN THE MONEY BECAUSE IT WAS ENCOURAGING AND AFTER YEARSOF EFFORT IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO FIND THAT SHE HAD LEARNED TO DOSOMETHING THOUGH IT WAS ONLY TO WRITE A SENSATION STORY
            ILLUSTRATION A CHECK FOR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARSA PROUDER YOUNG WOMAN WAS SELDOM SEEN THAN SHE WHEN HAVING COMPOSEDHERSELF SHE ELECTRIFIED THE FAMILY BY APPEARING BEFORE THEM WITH THELETTER IN ONE HAND THE CHECK IN THE OTHER ANNOUNCING THAT SHE HAD WONTHE PRIZE
 OF COURSE THERE WAS A GREAT JUBILEE AND WHEN THE STORY CAMEEVERY ONE READ AND PRAISED IT THOUGH AFTER HER FATHER HAD TOLD HER THATTHE LANGUAGE WAS GOOD THE ROMANCE FRESH AND HEARTY AND THE TRAGEDYQUITE THRILLING HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID IN HIS UNWORLDLY WAYYOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS JO
 AIM AT THE HIGHEST AND NEVER MIND THEMONEY
I THINK THE MONEY IS THE BEST PART OF IT
 WHAT WILL YOU DO WITHSUCH A FORTUNE
 ASKED AMY REGARDING THE MAGIC SLIP OF PAPER WITH AREVERENTIAL EYE
SEND BETH AND MOTHER TO THE SEASIDE FOR A MONTH OR TWO ANSWERED JOPROMPTLY
OH HOW SPLENDID
 NO I CANT DO IT DEAR IT WOULD BE SO SELFISHCRIED BETH WHO HAD CLAPPED HER THIN HANDS AND TAKEN A LONG BREATH ASIF PINING FOR FRESH OCEANBREEZES THEN STOPPED HERSELF AND MOTIONEDAWAY THE CHECK WHICH HER SISTER WAVED BEFORE HER
AH BUT YOU SHALL GO IVE SET MY HEART ON IT THATS WHAT I TRIED FORAND THATS WHY I SUCCEEDED
 I NEVER GET ON WHEN I THINK OF MYSELF ALONESO IT WILL HELP ME TO WORK FOR YOU DONT YOU SEE
 BESIDES MARMEE NEEDSTHE CHANGE AND SHE WONT LEAVE YOU SO YOU MUST GO
 WONT IT BE FUNTO SEE YOU COME HOME PLUMP AND ROSY AGAIN
 HURRAH FOR DR
 JO WHO ALWAYSCURES HER PATIENTS
TO THE SEA SIDE THEY WENT AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION AND THOUGH BETH DIDNTCOME HOME AS PLUMP AND ROSY AS COULD BE DESIRED SHE WAS MUCH BETTERWHILE MRS
 MARCH DECLARED SHE FELT TEN YEARS YOUNGER SO JO WASSATISFIED WITH THE INVESTMENT OF HER PRIZE MONEY AND FELL TO WORK WITHA CHEERY SPIRIT BENT ON EARNING MORE OF THOSE DELIGHTFUL CHECKS
 SHEDID EARN SEVERAL THAT YEAR AND BEGAN TO FEEL HERSELF A POWER IN THEHOUSE FOR BY THE MAGIC OF A PEN HER RUBBISH TURNED INTO COMFORTS FORTHEM ALL
 THE DUKES DAUGHTER PAID THE BUTCHERS BILL A PHANTOMHAND PUT DOWN A NEW CARPET AND THE CURSE OF THE COVENTRYS PROVED THEBLESSING OF THE MARCHES IN THE WAY OF GROCERIES AND GOWNS
WEALTH IS CERTAINLY A MOST DESIRABLE THING BUT POVERTY HAS ITS SUNNYSIDE AND ONE OF THE SWEET USES OF ADVERSITY IS THE GENUINE SATISFACTIONWHICH COMES FROM HEARTY WORK OF HEAD OR HAND AND TO THE INSPIRATION OFNECESSITY WE OWE HALF THE WISE BEAUTIFUL AND USEFUL BLESSINGS OF THEWORLD
 JO ENJOYED A TASTE OF THIS SATISFACTION AND CEASED TO ENVYRICHER GIRLS TAKING GREAT COMFORT IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SHE COULDSUPPLY HER OWN WANTS AND NEED ASK NO ONE FOR A PENNY
LITTLE NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF HER STORIES BUT THEY FOUND A MARKET ANDENCOURAGED BY THIS FACT SHE RESOLVED TO MAKE A BOLD STROKE FOR FAME ANDFORTUNE
 HAVING COPIED HER NOVEL FOR THE FOURTH TIME READ IT TO ALL HERCONFIDENTIAL FRIENDS AND SUBMITTED IT WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING TO THREEPUBLISHERS SHE AT LAST DISPOSED OF IT ON CONDITION THAT SHE WOULD CUTIT DOWN ONE THIRD AND OMIT ALL THE PARTS WHICH SHE PARTICULARLYADMIRED
NOW I MUST EITHER BUNDLE IT BACK INTO MY TINKITCHEN TO MOULD PAY FORPRINTING IT MYSELF OR CHOP IT UP TO SUIT PURCHASERS AND GET WHAT I CANFOR IT
 FAME IS A VERY GOOD THING TO HAVE IN THE HOUSE BUT CASH IS MORECONVENIENT SO I WISH TO TAKE THE SENSE OF THE MEETING ON THIS IMPORTANTSUBJECT SAID JO CALLING A FAMILY COUNCIL
DONT SPOIL YOUR BOOK MY GIRL FOR THERE IS MORE IN IT THAN YOU KNOWAND THE IDEA IS WELL WORKED OUT
 LET IT WAIT AND RIPEN WAS HERFATHERS ADVICE AND HE PRACTISED AS HE PREACHED HAVING WAITEDPATIENTLY THIRTY YEARS FOR FRUIT OF HIS OWN TO RIPEN AND BEING IN NOHASTE TO GATHER IT EVEN NOW WHEN IT WAS SWEET AND MELLOW
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT JO WILL PROFIT MORE BY MAKING THE TRIAL THAN BYWAITING SAID MRS
 MARCH
 CRITICISM IS THE BEST TEST OF SUCH WORK FORIT WILL SHOW HER BOTH UNSUSPECTED MERITS AND FAULTS AND HELP HER TO DOBETTER NEXT TIME
 WE ARE TOO PARTIAL BUT THE PRAISE AND BLAME OFOUTSIDERS WILL PROVE USEFUL EVEN IF SHE GETS BUT LITTLE MONEY
YES SAID JO KNITTING HER BROWS THATS JUST IT IVE BEEN FUSSINGOVER THE THING SO LONG I REALLY DONT KNOW WHETHER ITS GOOD BAD ORINDIFFERENT
 IT WILL BE A GREAT HELP TO HAVE COOL IMPARTIAL PERSONSTAKE A LOOK AT IT AND TELL ME WHAT THEY THINK OF IT
I WOULDNT LEAVE OUT A WORD OF IT YOULL SPOIL IT IF YOU DO FOR THEINTEREST OF THE STORY IS MORE IN THE MINDS THAN IN THE ACTIONS OF THEPEOPLE AND IT WILL BE ALL A MUDDLE IF YOU DONT EXPLAIN AS YOU GO ONSAID MEG WHO FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT THIS BOOK WAS THE MOST REMARKABLENOVEL EVER WRITTEN
BUT MR
 ALLEN SAYS LEAVE OUT THE EXPLANATIONS MAKE IT BRIEF ANDDRAMATIC AND LET THE CHARACTERS TELL THE STORY INTERRUPTED JOTURNING TO THE PUBLISHERS NOTE
DO AS HE TELLS YOU HE KNOWS WHAT WILL SELL AND WE DONT
 MAKE A GOODPOPULAR BOOK AND GET AS MUCH MONEY AS YOU CAN
 BY AND BY WHEN YOUVEGOT A NAME YOU CAN AFFORD TO DIGRESS AND HAVE PHILOSOPHICAL ANDMETAPHYSICAL PEOPLE IN YOUR NOVELS SAID AMY WHO TOOK A STRICTLYPRACTICAL VIEW OF THE SUBJECT
WELL SAID JO LAUGHING IF MY PEOPLE ARE PHILOSOPHICAL ANDMETAPHYSICAL IT ISNT MY FAULT FOR I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT SUCH THINGSEXCEPT WHAT I HEAR FATHER SAY SOMETIMES
 IF IVE GOT SOME OF HIS WISEIDEAS JUMBLED UP WITH MY ROMANCE SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR ME
 NOW BETHWHAT DO YOU SAY
I SHOULD SO LIKE TO SEE IT PRINTED SOON WAS ALL BETH SAID ANDSMILED IN SAYING IT BUT THERE WAS AN UNCONSCIOUS EMPHASIS ON THE LASTWORD AND A WISTFUL LOOK IN THE EYES THAT NEVER LOST THEIR CHILDLIKECANDOR WHICH CHILLED JOS HEART FOR A MINUTE WITH A FOREBODING FEARAND DECIDED HER TO MAKE HER LITTLE VENTURE SOON
SO WITH SPARTAN FIRMNESS THE YOUNG AUTHORESS LAID HER FIRSTBORN ONHER TABLE AND CHOPPED IT UP AS RUTHLESSLY AS ANY OGRE
 IN THE HOPE OFPLEASING EVERY ONE SHE TOOK EVERY ONES ADVICE AND LIKE THE OLD MANAND HIS DONKEY IN THE FABLE SUITED NOBODY
HER FATHER LIKED THE METAPHYSICAL STREAK WHICH HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY GOTINTO IT SO THAT WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN THOUGH SHE HAD HER DOUBTS ABOUTIT
 HER MOTHER THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS A TRIFLE TOO MUCH DESCRIPTIONOUT THEREFORE IT NEARLY ALL CAME AND WITH IT MANY NECESSARY LINKS INTHE STORY
 MEG ADMIRED THE TRAGEDY SO JO PILED UP THE AGONY TO SUITHER WHILE AMY OBJECTED TO THE FUN AND WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS INLIFE JO QUENCHED THE SPRIGHTLY SCENES WHICH RELIEVED THE SOMBRECHARACTER OF THE STORY
 THEN TO COMPLETE THE RUIN SHE CUT IT DOWN ONETHIRD AND CONFIDINGLY SENT THE POOR LITTLE ROMANCE LIKE A PICKEDROBIN OUT INTO THE BIG BUSY WORLD TO TRY ITS FATE
WELL IT WAS PRINTED AND SHE GOT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR IT LIKEWISEPLENTY OF PRAISE AND BLAME BOTH SO MUCH GREATER THAN SHE EXPECTED THATSHE WAS THROWN INTO A STATE OF BEWILDERMENT FROM WHICH IT TOOK HER SOMETIME TO RECOVER
YOU SAID MOTHER THAT CRITICISM WOULD HELP ME BUT HOW CAN IT WHENITS SO CONTRADICTORY THAT I DONT KNOW WHETHER IVE WRITTEN A PROMISINGBOOK OR BROKEN ALL THE TEN COMMANDMENTS
 CRIED POOR JO TURNING OVER AHEAP OF NOTICES THE PERUSAL OF WHICH FILLED HER WITH PRIDE AND JOY ONEMINUTE WRATH AND DIRE DISMAY THE NEXT
 THIS MAN SAYS AN EXQUISITEBOOK FULL OF TRUTH BEAUTY AND EARNESTNESS ALL IS SWEET PURE ANDHEALTHY CONTINUED THE PERPLEXED AUTHORESS
 THE NEXT THE THEORY OFTHE BOOK IS BAD FULL OF MORBID FANCIES SPIRITUALISTIC IDEAS ANDUNNATURAL CHARACTERS
 NOW AS I HAD NO THEORY OF ANY KIND DONTBELIEVE IN SPIRITUALISM AND COPIED MY CHARACTERS FROM LIFE I DONT SEEHOW THIS CRITIC CAN BE RIGHT
 ANOTHER SAYS ITS ONE OF THE BESTAMERICAN NOVELS WHICH HAS APPEARED FOR YEARS I KNOW BETTER THAN THATAND THE NEXT ASSERTS THAT THOUGH IT IS ORIGINAL AND WRITTEN WITH GREATFORCE AND FEELING IT IS A DANGEROUS BOOK
 TISNT
 SOME MAKE FUN OFIT SOME OVERPRAISE AND NEARLY ALL INSIST THAT I HAD A DEEP THEORY TOEXPOUND WHEN I ONLY WROTE IT FOR THE PLEASURE AND THE MONEY
 I WISH IDPRINTED IT WHOLE OR NOT AT ALL FOR I DO HATE TO BE SO MISJUDGED
HER FAMILY AND FRIENDS ADMINISTERED COMFORT AND COMMENDATION LIBERALLYYET IT WAS A HARD TIME FOR SENSITIVE HIGHSPIRITED JO WHO MEANT SOWELL AND HAD APPARENTLY DONE SO ILL
 BUT IT DID HER GOOD FOR THOSEWHOSE OPINION HAD REAL VALUE GAVE HER THE CRITICISM WHICH IS AN AUTHORSBEST EDUCATION AND WHEN THE FIRST SORENESS WAS OVER SHE COULD LAUGH ATHER POOR LITTLE BOOK YET BELIEVE IN IT STILL AND FEEL HERSELF THEWISER AND STRONGER FOR THE BUFFETING SHE HAD RECEIVED
NOT BEING A GENIUS LIKE KEATS IT WONT KILL ME SHE SAID STOUTLYAND IVE GOT THE JOKE ON MY SIDE AFTER ALL FOR THE PARTS THAT WERETAKEN STRAIGHT OUT OF REAL LIFE ARE DENOUNCED AS IMPOSSIBLE AND ABSURDAND THE SCENES THAT I MADE UP OUT OF MY OWN SILLY HEAD ARE PRONOUNCEDCHARMINGLY NATURAL TENDER AND TRUE
 SO ILL COMFORT MYSELF WITHTHAT AND WHEN IM READY ILL UP AGAIN AND TAKE ANOTHER

                         DOMESTIC EXPERIENCES
LIKE MOST OTHER YOUNG MATRONS MEG BEGAN HER MARRIED LIFE WITH THEDETERMINATION TO BE A MODEL HOUSEKEEPER
 JOHN SHOULD FIND HOME APARADISE HE SHOULD ALWAYS SEE A SMILING FACE SHOULD FARE SUMPTUOUSLYEVERY DAY AND NEVER KNOW THE LOSS OF A BUTTON
 SHE BROUGHT SO MUCHLOVE ENERGY AND CHEERFULNESS TO THE WORK THAT SHE COULD NOT BUTSUCCEED IN SPITE OF SOME OBSTACLES
 HER PARADISE WAS NOT A TRANQUILONE FOR THE LITTLE WOMAN FUSSED WAS OVERANXIOUS TO PLEASE ANDBUSTLED ABOUT LIKE A TRUE MARTHA CUMBERED WITH MANY CARES
 SHE WAS TOOTIRED SOMETIMES EVEN TO SMILE JOHN GREW DYSPEPTIC AFTER A COURSE OFDAINTY DISHES AND UNGRATEFULLY DEMANDED PLAIN FARE
 AS FOR BUTTONS SHESOON LEARNED TO WONDER WHERE THEY WENT TO SHAKE HER HEAD OVER THECARELESSNESS OF MEN AND TO THREATEN TO MAKE HIM SEW THEM ON HIMSELFAND THEN SEE IF HIS WORK WOULD STAND IMPATIENT TUGS AND CLUMSY FINGERSANY BETTER THAN HERS
THEY WERE VERY HAPPY EVEN AFTER THEY DISCOVERED THAT THEY COULDNT LIVEON LOVE ALONE
 JOHN DID NOT FIND MEGS BEAUTY DIMINISHED THOUGH SHEBEAMED AT HIM FROM BEHIND THE FAMILIAR COFFEEPOT NOR DID MEG MISS ANYOF THE ROMANCE FROM THE DAILY PARTING WHEN HER HUSBAND FOLLOWED UP HISKISS WITH THE TENDER INQUIRY SHALL I SEND HOME VEAL OR MUTTON FORDINNER DARLING
 THE LITTLE HOUSE CEASED TO BE A GLORIFIED BOWER BUTIT BECAME A HOME AND THE YOUNG COUPLE SOON FELT THAT IT WAS A CHANGEFOR THE BETTER
 AT FIRST THEY PLAYED KEEPHOUSE AND FROLICKED OVER ITLIKE CHILDREN THEN JOHN TOOK STEADILY TO BUSINESS FEELING THE CARES OFTHE HEAD OF A FAMILY UPON HIS SHOULDERS AND MEG LAID BY HER CAMBRICWRAPPERS PUT ON A BIG APRON AND FELL TO WORK AS BEFORE SAID WITHMORE ENERGY THAN DISCRETION
WHILE THE COOKING MANIA LASTED SHE WENT THROUGH MRS
 CORNELIUSS RECEIPTBOOK AS IF IT WERE A MATHEMATICAL EXERCISE WORKING OUT THE PROBLEMSWITH PATIENCE AND CARE
 SOMETIMES HER FAMILY WERE INVITED IN TO HELP EATUP A TOO BOUNTEOUS FEAST OF SUCCESSES OR LOTTY WOULD BE PRIVATELYDESPATCHED WITH A BATCH OF FAILURES WHICH WERE TO BE CONCEALED FROM ALLEYES IN THE CONVENIENT STOMACHS OF THE LITTLE HUMMELS
 AN EVENING WITHJOHN OVER THE ACCOUNTBOOKS USUALLY PRODUCED A TEMPORARY LULL IN THECULINARY ENTHUSIASM AND A FRUGAL FIT WOULD ENSUE DURING WHICH THE POORMAN WAS PUT THROUGH A COURSE OF BREADPUDDING HASH AND WARMEDOVERCOFFEE WHICH TRIED HIS SOUL ALTHOUGH HE BORE IT WITH PRAISEWORTHYFORTITUDE
 BEFORE THE GOLDEN MEAN WAS FOUND HOWEVER MEG ADDED TO HERDOMESTIC POSSESSIONS WHAT YOUNG COUPLES SELDOM GET ON LONG WITHOUTAFAMILY JAR
FIRED WITH A HOUSEWIFELY WISH TO SEE HER STOREROOM STOCKED WITHHOMEMADE PRESERVES SHE UNDERTOOK TO PUT UP HER OWN CURRANT JELLY
 JOHNWAS REQUESTED TO ORDER HOME A DOZEN OR SO OF LITTLE POTS AND AN EXTRAQUANTITY OF SUGAR FOR THEIR OWN CURRANTS WERE RIPE AND WERE TO BEATTENDED TO AT ONCE
 AS JOHN FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT MY WIFE WAS EQUAL TOANYTHING AND TOOK A NATURAL PRIDE IN HER SKILL HE RESOLVED THAT SHESHOULD BE GRATIFIED AND THEIR ONLY CROP OF FRUIT LAID BY IN A MOSTPLEASING FORM FOR WINTER USE
 HOME CAME FOUR DOZEN DELIGHTFUL LITTLEPOTS HALF A BARREL OF SUGAR AND A SMALL BOY TO PICK THE CURRANTS FORHER
 WITH HER PRETTY HAIR TUCKED INTO A LITTLE CAP ARMS BARED TO THEELBOW AND A CHECKED APRON WHICH HAD A COQUETTISH LOOK IN SPITE OF THEBIB THE YOUNG HOUSEWIFE FELL TO WORK FEELING NO DOUBTS ABOUT HERSUCCESS FOR HADNT SHE SEEN HANNAH DO IT HUNDREDS OF TIMES
 THE ARRAYOF POTS RATHER AMAZED HER AT FIRST BUT JOHN WAS SO FOND OF JELLY ANDTHE NICE LITTLE JARS WOULD LOOK SO WELL ON THE TOP SHELF THAT MEGRESOLVED TO FILL THEM ALL AND SPENT A LONG DAY PICKING BOILINGSTRAINING AND FUSSING OVER HER JELLY
 SHE DID HER BEST SHE ASKEDADVICE OF MRS
 CORNELIUS SHE RACKED HER BRAIN TO REMEMBER WHAT HANNAHDID THAT SHE HAD LEFT UNDONE SHE REBOILED RESUGARED AND RESTRAINEDBUT THAT DREADFUL STUFF WOULDNT JELL
SHE LONGED TO RUN HOME BIB AND ALL AND ASK MOTHER TO LEND A HAND BUTJOHN AND SHE HAD AGREED THAT THEY WOULD NEVER ANNOY ANY ONE WITH THEIRPRIVATE WORRIES EXPERIMENTS OR QUARRELS
 THEY HAD LAUGHED OVER THATLAST WORD AS IF THE IDEA IT SUGGESTED WAS A MOST PREPOSTEROUS ONE BUTTHEY HAD HELD TO THEIR RESOLVE AND WHENEVER THEY COULD GET ON WITHOUTHELP THEY DID SO AND NO ONE INTERFERED FOR MRS
 MARCH HAD ADVISED THEPLAN
 SO MEG WRESTLED ALONE WITH THE REFRACTORY SWEETMEATS ALL THAT HOTSUMMER DAY AND AT FIVE OCLOCK SAT DOWN IN HER TOPSYTURVY KITCHENWRUNG HER BEDAUBED HANDS LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND WEPT
NOW IN THE FIRST FLUSH OF THE NEW LIFE SHE HAD OFTEN SAIDMY HUSBAND SHALL ALWAYS FEEL FREE TO BRING A FRIEND HOME WHENEVER HELIKES
 I SHALL ALWAYS BE PREPARED THERE SHALL BE NO FLURRY NOSCOLDING NO DISCOMFORT BUT A NEAT HOUSE A CHEERFUL WIFE AND A GOODDINNER
 JOHN DEAR NEVER STOP TO ASK MY LEAVE INVITE WHOM YOU PLEASEAND BE SURE OF A WELCOME FROM ME
HOW CHARMING THAT WAS TO BE SURE
 JOHN QUITE GLOWED WITH PRIDE TO HEARHER SAY IT AND FELT WHAT A BLESSED THING IT WAS TO HAVE A SUPERIORWIFE
 BUT ALTHOUGH THEY HAD HAD COMPANY FROM TIME TO TIME IT NEVERHAPPENED TO BE UNEXPECTED AND MEG HAD NEVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TODISTINGUISH HERSELF TILL NOW
 IT ALWAYS HAPPENS SO IN THIS VALE OFTEARS THERE IS AN INEVITABILITY ABOUT SUCH THINGS WHICH WE CAN ONLYWONDER AT DEPLORE AND BEAR AS WE BEST CAN
IF JOHN HAD NOT FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE JELLY IT REALLY WOULD HAVE BEENUNPARDONABLE IN HIM TO CHOOSE THAT DAY OF ALL THE DAYS IN THE YEAR TOBRING A FRIEND HOME TO DINNER UNEXPECTEDLY
 CONGRATULATING HIMSELF THATA HANDSOME REPAST HAD BEEN ORDERED THAT MORNING FEELING SURE THAT ITWOULD BE READY TO THE MINUTE AND INDULGING IN PLEASANT ANTICIPATIONS OFTHE CHARMING EFFECT IT WOULD PRODUCE WHEN HIS PRETTY WIFE CAME RUNNINGOUT TO MEET HIM HE ESCORTED HIS FRIEND TO HIS MANSION WITH THEIRREPRESSIBLE SATISFACTION OF A YOUNG HOST AND HUSBAND
IT IS A WORLD OF DISAPPOINTMENTS AS JOHN DISCOVERED WHEN HE REACHED THEDOVECOTE
 THE FRONT DOOR USUALLY STOOD HOSPITABLY OPEN NOW IT WAS NOTONLY SHUT BUT LOCKED AND YESTERDAYS MUD STILL ADORNED THE STEPS
 THEPARLORWINDOWS WERE CLOSED AND CURTAINED NO PICTURE OF THE PRETTY WIFESEWING ON THE PIAZZA IN WHITE WITH A DISTRACTING LITTLE BOW IN HERHAIR OR A BRIGHTEYED HOSTESS SMILING A SHY WELCOME AS SHE GREETED HERGUEST
 NOTHING OF THE SORT FOR NOT A SOUL APPEARED BUT ASANGUINARYLOOKING BOY ASLEEP UNDER THE CURRANTBUSHES
IM AFRAID SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED
 STEP INTO THE GARDEN SCOTT WHILE ILOOK UP MRS
 BROOKE SAID JOHN ALARMED AT THE SILENCE AND SOLITUDE
ROUND THE HOUSE HE HURRIED LED BY A PUNGENT SMELL OF BURNT SUGAR ANDMR
 SCOTT STROLLED AFTER HIM WITH A QUEER LOOK ON HIS FACE
 HE PAUSEDDISCREETLY AT A DISTANCE WHEN BROOKE DISAPPEARED BUT HE COULD BOTH SEEAND HEAR AND BEING A BACHELOR ENJOYED THE PROSPECT MIGHTILY
IN THE KITCHEN REIGNED CONFUSION AND DESPAIR ONE EDITION OF JELLY WASTRICKLED FROM POT TO POT ANOTHER LAY UPON THE FLOOR AND A THIRD WASBURNING GAYLY ON THE STOVE
 LOTTY WITH TEUTONIC PHLEGM WAS CALMLYEATING BREAD AND CURRANT WINE FOR THE JELLY WAS STILL IN A HOPELESSLYLIQUID STATE WHILE MRS

JOHN BROOKE LAUGHED THEN AS HE NEVER DARED TO LAUGH AFTERWARD AND THEDERISIVE SCOTT SMILED INVOLUNTARILY AS HE HEARD THE HEARTY PEAL WHICHPUT THE FINISHING STROKE TO POOR MEGS WOE
IS THAT ALL
 FLING IT OUT OF WINDOW AND DONT BOTHER ANY MORE ABOUTIT
 ILL BUY YOU QUARTS IF YOU WANT IT BUT FOR HEAVENS SAKE DONT HAVEHYSTERICS FOR IVE BROUGHT JACK SCOTT HOME TO DINNER ANDJOHN GOT NO FURTHER FOR MEG CAST HIM OFF AND CLASPED HER HANDS WITH ATRAGIC GESTURE AS SHE FELL INTO A CHAIR EXCLAIMING IN A TONE OF MINGLEDINDIGNATION REPROACH AND DISMAYA MAN TO DINNER AND EVERYTHING IN A MESS
 JOHN BROOKE HOW COULD YOUDO SUCH A THING
HUSH HES IN THE GARDEN
 I FORGOT THE CONFOUNDED JELLY BUT IT CANTBE HELPED NOW SAID JOHN SURVEYING THE PROSPECT WITH AN ANXIOUS EYE
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SENT WORD OR TOLD ME THIS MORNING AND YOU OUGHT TOHAVE REMEMBERED HOW BUSY I WAS CONTINUED MEG PETULANTLY FOR EVENTURTLEDOVES WILL PECK WHEN RUFFLED
I DIDNT KNOW IT THIS MORNING AND THERE WAS NO TIME TO SEND WORD FORI MET HIM ON THE WAY OUT
 I NEVER THOUGHT OF ASKING LEAVE WHEN YOU HAVEALWAYS TOLD ME TO DO AS I LIKED
 I NEVER TRIED IT BEFORE AND HANG ME IFI EVER DO AGAIN
 ADDED JOHN WITH AN AGGRIEVED AIR
I SHOULD HOPE NOT
 TAKE HIM AWAY AT ONCE I CANT SEE HIM AND THEREISNT ANY DINNER
WELL I LIKE THAT
 WHERES THE BEEF AND VEGETABLES I SENT HOME AND THEPUDDING YOU PROMISED
 CRIED JOHN RUSHING TO THE LARDER
I HADNT TIME TO COOK ANYTHING I MEANT TO DINE AT MOTHERS
 IM SORRYBUT I WAS SO BUSY AND MEGS TEARS BEGAN AGAIN
JOHN WAS A MILD MAN BUT HE WAS HUMAN AND AFTER A LONG DAYS WORK TOCOME HOME TIRED HUNGRY AND HOPEFUL TO FIND A CHAOTIC HOUSE AN EMPTYTABLE AND A CROSS WIFE WAS NOT EXACTLY CONDUCIVE TO REPOSE OF MIND ORMANNER
 HE RESTRAINED HIMSELF HOWEVER AND THE LITTLE SQUALL WOULD HAVEBLOWN OVER BUT FOR ONE UNLUCKY WORD
ITS A SCRAPE I ACKNOWLEDGE BUT IF YOU WILL LEND A HAND WELL PULLTHROUGH AND HAVE A GOOD TIME YET

HE MEANT IT FOR A GOODNATURED JOKE BUT THAT ONE WORD SEALED HIS FATE
MEG THOUGHT IT WAS TOO CRUEL TO HINT ABOUT HER SAD FAILURE AND THELAST ATOM OF PATIENCE VANISHED AS HE SPOKE
YOU MUST GET YOURSELF OUT OF THE SCRAPE AS YOU CAN IM TOO USED UP TOEXERT MYSELF FOR ANY ONE
 ITS LIKE A MAN TO PROPOSE A BONE AND VULGARBREAD AND CHEESE FOR COMPANY
 I WONT HAVE ANYTHING OF THE SORT IN MYHOUSE
 TAKE THAT SCOTT UP TO MOTHERS AND TELL HIM IM AWAY SICKDEADANYTHING
 I WONT SEE HIM AND YOU TWO CAN LAUGH AT ME AND MYJELLY AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE YOU WONT HAVE ANYTHING ELSE HERE ANDHAVING DELIVERED HER DEFIANCE ALL IN ONE BREATH MEG CAST AWAY HERPINAFORE AND PRECIPITATELY LEFT THE FIELD TO BEMOAN HERSELF IN HER OWNROOM
WHAT THOSE TWO CREATURES DID IN HER ABSENCE SHE NEVER KNEW BUT MR
SCOTT WAS NOT TAKEN UP TO MOTHERS AND WHEN MEG DESCENDED AFTER THEYHAD STROLLED AWAY TOGETHER SHE FOUND TRACES OF A PROMISCUOUS LUNCHWHICH FILLED HER WITH HORROR
 LOTTY REPORTED THAT THEY HAD EATEN AMUCH AND GREATLY LAUGHED AND THE MASTER BID HER THROW AWAY ALL THESWEET STUFF AND HIDE THE POTS
MEG LONGED TO GO AND TELL MOTHER BUT A SENSE OF SHAME AT HER OWNSHORTCOMINGS OF LOYALTY TO JOHN WHO MIGHT BE CRUEL BUT NOBODYSHOULD KNOW IT RESTRAINED HER AND AFTER A SUMMARY CLEARING UP SHEDRESSED HERSELF PRETTILY AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT FOR JOHN TO COME AND BEFORGIVEN
UNFORTUNATELY JOHN DIDNT COME NOT SEEING THE MATTER IN THAT LIGHT
 HEHAD CARRIED IT OFF AS A GOOD JOKE WITH SCOTT EXCUSED HIS LITTLE WIFE ASWELL AS HE COULD AND PLAYED THE HOST SO HOSPITABLY THAT HIS FRIENDENJOYED THE IMPROMPTU DINNER AND PROMISED TO COME AGAIN
 BUT JOHN WASANGRY THOUGH HE DID NOT SHOW IT HE FELT THAT MEG HAD GOT HIM INTO ASCRAPE AND THEN DESERTED HIM IN HIS HOUR OF NEED
 IT WASNT FAIR TOTELL A MAN TO BRING FOLKS HOME ANY TIME WITH PERFECT FREEDOM AND WHENHE TOOK YOU AT YOUR WORD TO FLAME UP AND BLAME HIM AND LEAVE HIM INTHE LURCH TO BE LAUGHED AT OR PITIED
 NO BY GEORGE IT WASNT
 AND MEGMUST KNOW IT
 HE HAD FUMED INWARDLY DURING THE FEAST BUT WHEN THEFLURRY WAS OVER AND HE STROLLED HOME AFTER SEEING SCOTT OFF A MILDERMOOD CAME OVER HIM
 POOR LITTLE THING
 IT WAS HARD UPON HER WHEN SHETRIED SO HEARTILY TO PLEASE ME
 SHE WAS WRONG OF COURSE BUT THEN SHEWAS YOUNG
 I MUST BE PATIENT AND TEACH HER
 HE HOPED SHE HAD NOT GONEHOMEHE HATED GOSSIP AND INTERFERENCE
 FOR A MINUTE HE WAS RUFFLEDAGAIN AT THE MERE THOUGHT OF IT AND THEN THE FEAR THAT MEG WOULD CRYHERSELF SICK SOFTENED HIS HEART AND SENT HIM ON AT A QUICKER PACERESOLVING TO BE CALM AND KIND BUT FIRM QUITE FIRM AND SHOW HER WHERESHE HAD FAILED IN HER DUTY TO HER SPOUSE
MEG LIKEWISE RESOLVED TO BE CALM AND KIND BUT FIRM AND SHOW HIMHIS DUTY
 SHE LONGED TO RUN TO MEET HIM AND BEG PARDON AND BE KISSEDAND COMFORTED AS SHE WAS SURE OF BEING BUT OF COURSE SHE DID NOTHINGOF THE SORT AND WHEN SHE SAW JOHN COMING BEGAN TO HUM QUITE NATURALLYAS SHE ROCKED AND SEWED LIKE A LADY OF LEISURE IN HER BEST PARLOR
JOHN WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED NOT TO FIND A TENDER NIOBE BUT FEELINGTHAT HIS DIGNITY DEMANDED THE FIRST APOLOGY HE MADE NONE ONLY CAMELEISURELY IN AND LAID HIMSELF UPON THE SOFA WITH THE SINGULARLYRELEVANT REMARKWE ARE GOING TO HAVE A NEW MOON MY DEAR
IVE NO OBJECTION WAS MEGS EQUALLY SOOTHING REMARK
A FEW OTHER TOPICS OF GENERAL INTEREST WERE INTRODUCED BY MR
 BROOKEAND WETBLANKETED BY MRS
 BROOKE AND CONVERSATION LANGUISHED
 JOHN WENTTO ONE WINDOW UNFOLDED HIS PAPER AND WRAPPED HIMSELF IN ITFIGURATIVELY SPEAKING
 MEG WENT TO THE OTHER WINDOW AND SEWED AS IF NEWROSETTES FOR HER SLIPPERS WERE AMONG THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE
 NEITHERSPOKE BOTH LOOKED QUITE CALM AND FIRM AND BOTH FELT DESPERATELYUNCOMFORTABLE
          ILLUSTRATION BOTH FELT DESPERATELY UNCOMFORTABLEOH DEAR THOUGHT MEG MARRIED LIFE IS VERY TRYING AND DOES NEEDINFINITE PATIENCE AS WELL AS LOVE AS MOTHER SAYS
 THE WORD MOTHERSUGGESTED OTHER MATERNAL COUNSELS GIVEN LONG AGO AND RECEIVED WITHUNBELIEVING PROTESTS
JOHN IS A GOOD MAN BUT HE HAS HIS FAULTS AND YOU MUST LEARN TO SEEAND BEAR WITH THEM REMEMBERING YOUR OWN
 HE IS VERY DECIDED BUT NEVERWILL BE OBSTINATE IF YOU REASON KINDLY NOT OPPOSE IMPATIENTLY
 HE ISVERY ACCURATE AND PARTICULAR ABOUT THE TRUTHA GOOD TRAIT THOUGH YOUCALL HIM FUSSY
 NEVER DECEIVE HIM BY LOOK OR WORD MEG AND HE WILLGIVE YOU THE CONFIDENCE YOU DESERVE THE SUPPORT YOU NEED
 HE HAS ATEMPER NOT LIKE OURSONE FLASH AND THEN ALL OVERBUT THE WHITESTILL ANGER THAT IS SELDOM STIRRED BUT ONCE KINDLED IS HARD TOQUENCH
 BE CAREFUL VERY CAREFUL NOT TO WAKE THIS ANGER AGAINSTYOURSELF FOR PEACE AND HAPPINESS DEPEND ON KEEPING HIS RESPECT
 WATCHYOURSELF BE THE FIRST TO ASK PARDON IF YOU BOTH ERR AND GUARD AGAINSTTHE LITTLE PIQUES MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND HASTY WORDS THAT OFTEN PAVETHE WAY FOR BITTER SORROW AND REGRET
THESE WORDS CAME BACK TO MEG AS SHE SAT SEWING IN THE SUNSETESPECIALLY THE LAST
 THIS WAS THE FIRST SERIOUS DISAGREEMENT HER OWNHASTY SPEECHES SOUNDED BOTH SILLY AND UNKIND AS SHE RECALLED THEM HEROWN ANGER LOOKED CHILDISH NOW AND THOUGHTS OF POOR JOHN COMING HOME TOSUCH A SCENE QUITE MELTED HER HEART
 SHE GLANCED AT HIM WITH TEARS INHER EYES BUT HE DID NOT SEE THEM SHE PUT DOWN HER WORK AND GOT UPTHINKING I WILL BE THE FIRST TO SAY FORGIVE ME BUT HE DID NOTSEEM TO HEAR HER SHE WENT VERY SLOWLY ACROSS THE ROOM FOR PRIDE WASHARD TO SWALLOW AND STOOD BY HIM BUT HE DID NOT TURN HIS HEAD
 FOR AMINUTE SHE FELT AS IF SHE REALLY COULDNT DO IT THEN CAME THE THOUGHTTHIS IS THE BEGINNING ILL DO MY PART AND HAVE NOTHING TO REPROACHMYSELF WITH AND STOOPING DOWN SHE SOFTLY KISSED HER HUSBAND ON THEFOREHEAD
 OF COURSE THAT SETTLED IT THE PENITENT KISS WAS BETTER THAN AWORLD OF WORDS AND JOHN HAD HER ON HIS KNEE IN A MINUTE SAYINGTENDERLYIT WAS TOO BAD TO LAUGH AT THE POOR LITTLE JELLYPOTS
 FORGIVE MEDEAR I NEVER WILL AGAIN
BUT HE DID OH BLESS YOU YES HUNDREDS OF TIMES AND SO DID MEG BOTHDECLARING THAT IT WAS THE SWEETEST JELLY THEY EVER MADE FOR FAMILYPEACE WAS PRESERVED IN THAT LITTLE FAMILY JAR
AFTER THIS MEG HAD MR
 SCOTT TO DINNER BY SPECIAL INVITATION ANDSERVED HIM UP A PLEASANT FEAST WITHOUT A COOKED WIFE FOR THE FIRSTCOURSE ON WHICH OCCASION SHE WAS SO GAY AND GRACIOUS AND MADEEVERYTHING GO OFF SO CHARMINGLY THAT MR
 SCOTT TOLD JOHN HE WAS A HAPPYFELLOW AND SHOOK HIS HEAD OVER THE HARDSHIPS OF BACHELORHOOD ALL THEWAY HOME
IN THE AUTUMN NEW TRIALS AND EXPERIENCES CAME TO MEG
 SALLIE MOFFATRENEWED HER FRIENDSHIP WAS ALWAYS RUNNING OUT FOR A DISH OF GOSSIP ATTHE LITTLE HOUSE OR INVITING THAT POOR DEAR TO COME IN AND SPEND THEDAY AT THE BIG HOUSE
 IT WAS PLEASANT FOR IN DULL WEATHER MEG OFTENFELT LONELY ALL WERE BUSY AT HOME JOHN ABSENT TILL NIGHT AND NOTHINGTO DO BUT SEW OR READ OR POTTER ABOUT
 SO IT NATURALLY FELL OUT THATMEG GOT INTO THE WAY OF GADDING AND GOSSIPING WITH HER FRIEND
 SEEINGSALLIES PRETTY THINGS MADE HER LONG FOR SUCH AND PITY HERSELF BECAUSESHE HAD NOT GOT THEM
 SALLIE WAS VERY KIND AND OFTEN OFFERED HER THECOVETED TRIFLES BUT MEG DECLINED THEM KNOWING THAT JOHN WOULDNT LIKEIT AND THEN THIS FOOLISH LITTLE WOMAN WENT AND DID WHAT JOHN DISLIKEDINFINITELY WORSE
SHE KNEW HER HUSBANDS INCOME AND SHE LOVED TO FEEL THAT HE TRUSTEDHER NOT ONLY WITH HIS HAPPINESS BUT WHAT SOME MEN SEEM TO VALUEMOREHIS MONEY
 SHE KNEW WHERE IT WAS WAS FREE TO TAKE WHAT SHELIKED AND ALL HE ASKED WAS THAT SHE SHOULD KEEP ACCOUNT OF EVERY PENNYPAY BILLS ONCE A MONTH AND REMEMBER THAT SHE WAS A POOR MANS WIFE
TILL NOW SHE HAD DONE WELL BEEN PRUDENT AND EXACT KEPT HER LITTLEACCOUNTBOOKS NEATLY AND SHOWED THEM TO HIM MONTHLY WITHOUT FEAR
 BUTTHAT AUTUMN THE SERPENT GOT INTO MEGS PARADISE AND TEMPTED HER LIKEMANY A MODERN EVE NOT WITH APPLES BUT WITH DRESS
 MEG DIDNT LIKE TOBE PITIED AND MADE TO FEEL POOR IT IRRITATED HER BUT SHE WAS ASHAMEDTO CONFESS IT AND NOW AND THEN SHE TRIED TO CONSOLE HERSELF BY BUYINGSOMETHING PRETTY SO THAT SALLIE NEEDNT THINK SHE HAD TO ECONOMIZE
 SHEALWAYS FELT WICKED AFTER IT FOR THE PRETTY THINGS WERE SELDOMNECESSARIES BUT THEN THEY COST SO LITTLE IT WASNT WORTH WORRYINGABOUT SO THE TRIFLES INCREASED UNCONSCIOUSLY AND IN THE SHOPPINGEXCURSIONS SHE WAS NO LONGER A PASSIVE LOOKERON
BUT THE TRIFLES COST MORE THAN ONE WOULD IMAGINE AND WHEN SHE CAST UPHER ACCOUNTS AT THE END OF THE MONTH THE SUM TOTAL RATHER SCARED HER
JOHN WAS BUSY THAT MONTH AND LEFT THE BILLS TO HER THE NEXT MONTH HEWAS ABSENT BUT THE THIRD HE HAD A GRAND QUARTERLY SETTLING UP AND MEGNEVER FORGOT IT
 A FEW DAYS BEFORE SHE HAD DONE A DREADFUL THING AND ITWEIGHED UPON HER CONSCIENCE
 SALLIE HAD BEEN BUYING SILKS AND MEGLONGED FOR A NEW ONEJUST A HANDSOME LIGHT ONE FOR PARTIES HER BLACKSILK WAS SO COMMON AND THIN THINGS FOR EVENING WEAR WERE ONLY PROPERFOR GIRLS
 AUNT MARCH USUALLY GAVE THE SISTERS A PRESENT OF TWENTYFIVEDOLLARS APIECE AT NEW YEAR THAT WAS ONLY A MONTH TO WAIT AND HERE WASA LOVELY VIOLET SILK GOING AT A BARGAIN AND SHE HAD THE MONEY IF SHEONLY DARED TO TAKE IT
 JOHN ALWAYS SAID WHAT WAS HIS WAS HERS BUT WOULDHE THINK IT RIGHT TO SPEND NOT ONLY THE PROSPECTIVE FIVEANDTWENTY BUTANOTHER FIVEANDTWENTY OUT OF THE HOUSEHOLD FUND
 THAT WAS THEQUESTION
 SALLIE HAD URGED HER TO DO IT HAD OFFERED TO LOAN THE MONEYAND WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS IN LIFE HAD TEMPTED MEG BEYOND HERSTRENGTH
 IN AN EVIL MOMENT THE SHOPMAN HELD UP THE LOVELY SHIMMERINGFOLDS AND SAID A BARGAIN I ASSURE YOU MAAM
 SHE ANSWERED ILLTAKE IT AND IT WAS CUT OFF AND PAID FOR AND SALLIE HAD EXULTED ANDSHE HAD LAUGHED AS IF IT WERE A THING OF NO CONSEQUENCE AND DRIVENAWAY FEELING AS IF SHE HAD STOLEN SOMETHING AND THE POLICE WERE AFTERHER
             ILLUSTRATION A BARGAIN I ASSURE YOU MAAMWHEN SHE GOT HOME SHE TRIED TO ASSUAGE THE PANGS OF REMORSE BYSPREADING FORTH THE LOVELY SILK BUT IT LOOKED LESS SILVERY NOW DIDNTBECOME HER AFTER ALL AND THE WORDS FIFTY DOLLARS SEEMED STAMPED LIKEA PATTERN DOWN EACH BREADTH
 SHE PUT IT AWAY BUT IT HAUNTED HER NOTDELIGHTFULLY AS A NEW DRESS SHOULD BUT DREADFULLY LIKE THE GHOST OF AFOLLY THAT WAS NOT EASILY LAID
 WHEN JOHN GOT OUT HIS BOOKS THAT NIGHTMEGS HEART SANK AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER MARRIED LIFE SHE WASAFRAID OF HER HUSBAND
 THE KIND BROWN EYES LOOKED AS IF THEY COULD BESTERN AND THOUGH HE WAS UNUSUALLY MERRY SHE FANCIED HE HAD FOUND HEROUT BUT DIDNT MEAN TO LET HER KNOW IT
 THE HOUSEBILLS WERE ALL PAIDTHE BOOKS ALL IN ORDER
 JOHN HAD PRAISED HER AND WAS UNDOING THE OLDPOCKETBOOK WHICH THEY CALLED THE BANK WHEN MEG KNOWING THAT IT WASQUITE EMPTY STOPPED HIS HAND SAYING NERVOUSLYYOU HAVENT SEEN MY PRIVATE EXPENSE BOOK YET
JOHN NEVER ASKED TO SEE IT BUT SHE ALWAYS INSISTED ON HIS DOING SO ANDUSED TO ENJOY HIS MASCULINE AMAZEMENT AT THE QUEER THINGS WOMEN WANTEDAND MADE HIM GUESS WHAT PIPING WAS DEMAND FIERCELY THE MEANING OF AHUGMETIGHT OR WONDER HOW A LITTLE THING COMPOSED OF THREE ROSEBUDSA BIT OF VELVET AND A PAIR OF STRINGS COULD POSSIBLY BE A BONNET ANDCOST FIVE OR SIX DOLLARS
 THAT NIGHT HE LOOKED AS IF HE WOULD LIKE THEFUN OF QUIZZING HER FIGURES AND PRETENDING TO BE HORRIFIED AT HEREXTRAVAGANCE AS HE OFTEN DID BEING PARTICULARLY PROUD OF HIS PRUDENTWIFE
THE LITTLE BOOK WAS BROUGHT SLOWLY OUT AND LAID DOWN BEFORE HIM
 MEGGOT BEHIND HIS CHAIR UNDER PRETENCE OF SMOOTHING THE WRINKLES OUT OF HISTIRED FOREHEAD AND STANDING THERE SHE SAID WITH HER PANIC INCREASINGWITH EVERY WORDJOHN DEAR IM ASHAMED TO SHOW YOU MY BOOK FOR IVE REALLY BEENDREADFULLY EXTRAVAGANT LATELY
 I GO ABOUT SO MUCH I MUST HAVE THINGSYOU KNOW AND SALLIE ADVISED MY GETTING IT SO I DID AND MY NEWYEARSMONEY WILL PARTLY PAY FOR IT BUT I WAS SORRY AFTER ID DONE IT FOR IKNEW YOUD THINK IT WRONG IN ME
JOHN LAUGHED AND DREW HER ROUND BESIDE HIM SAYING GOODHUMOREDLYDONT GO AND HIDE
 I WONT BEAT YOU IF YOU HAVE GOT A PAIR OF KILLINGBOOTS IM RATHER PROUD OF MY WIFES FEET AND DONT MIND IF SHE DOESPAY EIGHT OR NINE DOLLARS FOR HER BOOTS IF THEY ARE GOOD ONES
THAT HAD BEEN ONE OF HER LAST TRIFLES AND JOHNS EYE HAD FALLEN ON ITAS HE SPOKE
 OH WHAT WILL HE SAY WHEN HE COMES TO THAT AWFUL FIFTYDOLLARS
 THOUGHT MEG WITH A SHIVER
ITS WORSE THAN BOOTS ITS A SILK DRESS SHE SAID WITH THE CALMNESSOF DESPERATION FOR SHE WANTED THE WORST OVER
WELL DEAR WHAT IS THE DEMD TOTAL AS MR
 MANTALINI SAYS
THAT DIDNT SOUND LIKE JOHN AND SHE KNEW HE WAS LOOKING UP AT HER WITHTHE STRAIGHTFORWARD LOOK THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN READY TO MEET ANDANSWER WITH ONE AS FRANK TILL NOW
 SHE TURNED THE PAGE AND HER HEAD ATTHE SAME TIME POINTING TO THE SUM WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN BAD ENOUGHWITHOUT THE FIFTY BUT WHICH WAS APPALLING TO HER WITH THAT ADDED
 FOR AMINUTE THE ROOM WAS VERY STILL THEN JOHN SAID SLOWLYBUT SHE COULDFEEL IT COST HIM AN EFFORT TO EXPRESS NO DISPLEASUREWELL I DONT KNOW THAT FIFTY IS MUCH FOR A DRESS WITH ALL THEFURBELOWS AND NOTIONS YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO FINISH IT OFF THESE DAYS
IT ISNT MADE OR TRIMMED SIGHED MEG FAINTLY FOR A SUDDENRECOLLECTION OF THE COST STILL TO BE INCURRED QUITE OVERWHELMED HER
TWENTYFIVE YARDS OF SILK SEEMS A GOOD DEAL TO COVER ONE SMALL WOMANBUT IVE NO DOUBT MY WIFE WILL LOOK AS FINE AS NED MOFFATS WHEN SHEGETS IT ON SAID JOHN DRYLY
I KNOW YOU ARE ANGRY JOHN BUT I CANT HELP IT
 I DONT MEAN TO WASTEYOUR MONEY AND I DIDNT THINK THOSE LITTLE THINGS WOULD COUNT UP SO
 ICANT RESIST THEM WHEN I SEE SALLIE BUYING ALL SHE WANTS AND PITYING MEBECAUSE I DONT
 I TRY TO BE CONTENTED BUT IT IS HARD AND IM TIRED OFBEING POOR
THE LAST WORDS WERE SPOKEN SO LOW SHE THOUGHT HE DID NOT HEAR THEM BUTHE DID AND THEY WOUNDED HIM DEEPLY FOR HE HAD DENIED HIMSELF MANYPLEASURES FOR MEGS SAKE
 SHE COULD HAVE BITTEN HER TONGUE OUT THEMINUTE SHE HAD SAID IT FOR JOHN PUSHED THE BOOKS AWAY AND GOT UPSAYING WITH A LITTLE QUIVER IN HIS VOICE I WAS AFRAID OF THIS I DOMY BEST MEG
 IF HE HAD SCOLDED HER OR EVEN SHAKEN HER IT WOULD NOTHAVE BROKEN HER HEART LIKE THOSE FEW WORDS
 SHE RAN TO HIM AND HELD HIMCLOSE CRYING WITH REPENTANT TEARS O JOHN MY DEAR KINDHARDWORKING BOY I DIDNT MEAN IT
 IT WAS SO WICKED SO UNTRUE ANDUNGRATEFUL HOW COULD I SAY IT
 OH HOW COULD I SAY IT
HE WAS VERY KIND FORGAVE HER READILY AND DID NOT UTTER ONE REPROACHBUT MEG KNEW THAT SHE HAD DONE AND SAID A THING WHICH WOULD NOT BEFORGOTTEN SOON ALTHOUGH HE MIGHT NEVER ALLUDE TO IT AGAIN
 SHE HADPROMISED TO LOVE HIM FOR BETTER FOR WORSE AND THEN SHE HIS WIFE HADREPROACHED HIM WITH HIS POVERTY AFTER SPENDING HIS EARNINGS RECKLESSLY
IT WAS DREADFUL AND THE WORST OF IT WAS JOHN WENT ON SO QUIETLYAFTERWARD JUST AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED EXCEPT THAT HE STAYED INTOWN LATER AND WORKED AT NIGHT WHEN SHE HAD GONE TO CRY HERSELF TOSLEEP
 A WEEK OF REMORSE NEARLY MADE MEG SICK AND THE DISCOVERY THATJOHN HAD COUNTERMANDED THE ORDER FOR HIS NEW GREATCOAT REDUCED HER TO ASTATE OF DESPAIR WHICH WAS PATHETIC TO BEHOLD
 HE HAD SIMPLY SAID INANSWER TO HER SURPRISED INQUIRIES AS TO THE CHANGE I CANT AFFORD ITMY DEAR
MEG SAID NO MORE BUT A FEW MINUTES AFTER HE FOUND HER IN THE HALL WITHHER FACE BURIED IN THE OLD GREATCOAT CRYING AS IF HER HEART WOULDBREAK
THEY HAD A LONG TALK THAT NIGHT AND MEG LEARNED TO LOVE HER HUSBANDBETTER FOR HIS POVERTY BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HAVE MADE A MAN OF HIMGIVEN HIM THE STRENGTH AND COURAGE TO FIGHT HIS OWN WAY AND TAUGHT HIMA TENDER PATIENCE WITH WHICH TO BEAR AND COMFORT THE NATURAL LONGINGSAND FAILURES OF THOSE HE LOVED
NEXT DAY SHE PUT HER PRIDE IN HER POCKET WENT TO SALLIE TOLD THETRUTH AND ASKED HER TO BUY THE SILK AS A FAVOR
 THE GOODNATURED MRS
MOFFAT WILLINGLY DID SO AND HAD THE DELICACY NOT TO MAKE HER A PRESENTOF IT IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD
 THEN MEG ORDERED HOME THE GREATCOAT ANDWHEN JOHN ARRIVED SHE PUT IT ON AND ASKED HIM HOW HE LIKED HER NEWSILK GOWN
 ONE CAN IMAGINE WHAT ANSWER HE MADE HOW HE RECEIVED HISPRESENT AND WHAT A BLISSFUL STATE OF THINGS ENSUED
 JOHN CAME HOMEEARLY MEG GADDED NO MORE AND THAT GREATCOAT WAS PUT ON IN THE MORNINGBY A VERY HAPPY HUSBAND AND TAKEN OFF AT NIGHT BY A MOST DEVOTED LITTLEWIFE

NONE OF THEM SHE HEARD OF A YOUNG HORSE AT THE FARMHOUSE OVER THERIVER AND THOUGH A LADY HAD NEVER RIDDEN HIM SHE RESOLVED TO TRYBECAUSE HE WAS HANDSOME AND SPIRITED
 HER STRUGGLES WERE REALLYPATHETIC THERE WAS NO ONE TO BRING THE HORSE TO THE SADDLE SO SHE TOOKTHE SADDLE TO THE HORSE
 MY DEAR CREATURE SHE ACTUALLY ROWED IT OVERTHE RIVER PUT IT ON HER HEAD AND MARCHED UP TO THE BARN TO THE UTTERAMAZEMENT OF THE OLD MAN
            ILLUSTRATION SHE TOOK THE SADDLE TO THE HORSEDID SHE RIDE THE HORSE
OF COURSE SHE DID AND HAD A CAPITAL TIME
 I EXPECTED TO SEE HERBROUGHT HOME IN FRAGMENTS BUT SHE MANAGED HIM PERFECTLY AND WAS THELIFE OF THE PARTY
WELL I CALL THAT PLUCKY
 AND YOUNG MR
 LAMB TURNED AN APPROVINGGLANCE UPON AMY WONDERING WHAT HIS MOTHER COULD BE SAYING TO MAKE THEGIRL LOOK SO RED AND UNCOMFORTABLE
SHE WAS STILL REDDER AND MORE UNCOMFORTABLE A MOMENT AFTER WHEN ASUDDEN TURN IN THE CONVERSATION INTRODUCED THE SUBJECT OF DRESS
 ONE OFTHE YOUNG LADIES ASKED JO WHERE SHE GOT THE PRETTY DRAB HAT SHE WORE TOTHE PICNIC AND STUPID JO INSTEAD OF MENTIONING THE PLACE WHERE IT WASBOUGHT TWO YEARS AGO MUST NEEDS ANSWER WITH UNNECESSARY FRANKNESSOH AMY PAINTED IT YOU CANT BUY THOSE SOFT SHADES SO WE PAINT OURSANY COLOR WE LIKE
 ITS A GREAT COMFORT TO HAVE AN ARTISTIC SISTER
ISNT THAT AN ORIGINAL IDEA
 CRIED MISS LAMB WHO FOUND JO GREAT FUN
THATS NOTHING COMPARED TO SOME OF HER BRILLIANT PERFORMANCES
 THERESNOTHING THE CHILD CANT DO
 WHY SHE WANTED A PAIR OF BLUE BOOTS FORSALLIES PARTY SO SHE JUST PAINTED HER SOILED WHITE ONES THE LOVELIESTSHADE OF SKYBLUE YOU EVER SAW AND THEY LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE SATINADDED JO WITH AN AIR OF PRIDE IN HER SISTERS ACCOMPLISHMENTS THATEXASPERATED AMY TILL SHE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE A RELIEF TO THROW HERCARDCASE AT HER
WE READ A STORY OF YOURS THE OTHER DAY AND ENJOYED IT VERY MUCHOBSERVED THE ELDER MISS LAMB WISHING TO COMPLIMENT THE LITERARY LADYWHO DID NOT LOOK THE CHARACTER JUST THEN IT MUST BE CONFESSED
ANY MENTION OF HER WORKS ALWAYS HAD A BAD EFFECT UPON JO WHO EITHERGREW RIGID AND LOOKED OFFENDED OR CHANGED THE SUBJECT WITH A BRUSQUEREMARK AS NOW
 SORRY YOU COULD FIND NOTHING BETTER TO READ
 I WRITETHAT RUBBISH BECAUSE IT SELLS AND ORDINARY PEOPLE LIKE IT
 ARE YOUGOING TO NEW YORK THIS WINTER
AS MISS LAMB HAD ENJOYED THE STORY THIS SPEECH WAS NOT EXACTLYGRATEFUL OR COMPLIMENTARY
 THE MINUTE IT WAS MADE JO SAW HER MISTAKEBUT FEARING TO MAKE THE MATTER WORSE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT IT WASFOR HER TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE TOWARD DEPARTURE AND DID SO WITH ANABRUPTNESS THAT LEFT THREE PEOPLE WITH HALFFINISHED SENTENCES IN THEIRMOUTHS
AMY WE MUST GO
 GOODBY DEAR DO COME AND SEE US WE AREPINING FOR A VISIT
 I DONT DARE TO ASK YOU MR
 LAMB BUT IF YOUSHOULD COME I DONT THINK I SHALL HAVE THE HEART TO SEND YOU AWAY
JO SAID THIS WITH SUCH A DROLL IMITATION OF MAY CHESTERS GUSHING STYLETHAT AMY GOT OUT OF THE ROOM AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE FEELING A STRONGDESIRE TO LAUGH AND CRY AT THE SAME TIME
DIDNT I DO THAT WELL
 ASKED JO WITH A SATISFIED AIR AS THEY WALKEDAWAY
NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE WAS AMYS CRUSHING REPLY
 WHATPOSSESSED YOU TO TELL THOSE STORIES ABOUT MY SADDLE AND THE HATS ANDBOOTS AND ALL THE REST OF IT
WHY ITS FUNNY AND AMUSES PEOPLE
 THEY KNOW WE ARE POOR SO ITS NOUSE PRETENDING THAT WE HAVE GROOMS BUY THREE OR FOUR HATS A SEASON ANDHAVE THINGS AS EASY AND FINE AS THEY DO
YOU NEEDNT GO AND TELL THEM ALL OUR LITTLE SHIFTS AND EXPOSE OURPOVERTY IN THAT PERFECTLY UNNECESSARY WAY
 YOU HAVENT A BIT OF PROPERPRIDE AND NEVER WILL LEARN WHEN TO HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND WHEN TO SPEAKSAID AMY DESPAIRINGLY
POOR JO LOOKED ABASHED AND SILENTLY CHAFED THE END OF HER NOSE WITH THESTIFF HANDKERCHIEF AS IF PERFORMING A PENANCE FOR HER MISDEMEANORS
HOW SHALL I BEHAVE HERE
 SHE ASKED AS THEY APPROACHED THE THIRDMANSION
JUST AS YOU PLEASE I WASH MY HANDS OF YOU WAS AMYS SHORT ANSWER
THEN ILL ENJOY MYSELF
 THE BOYS ARE AT HOME AND WELL HAVE ACOMFORTABLE TIME
 GOODNESS KNOWS I NEED A LITTLE CHANGE FOR ELEGANCEHAS A BAD EFFECT UPON MY CONSTITUTION RETURNED JO GRUFFLY BEINGDISTURBED BY HER FAILURES TO SUIT
AN ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOME FROM THREE BIG BOYS AND SEVERAL PRETTY CHILDRENSPEEDILY SOOTHED HER RUFFLED FEELINGS AND LEAVING AMY TO ENTERTAIN THEHOSTESS AND MR
 TUDOR WHO HAPPENED TO BE CALLING LIKEWISE JO DEVOTEDHERSELF TO THE YOUNG FOLKS AND FOUND THE CHANGE REFRESHING
 SHELISTENED TO COLLEGE STORIES WITH DEEP INTEREST CARESSED POINTERS ANDPOODLES WITHOUT A MURMUR AGREED HEARTILY THAT TOM BROWN WAS A BRICKREGARDLESS OF THE IMPROPER FORM OF PRAISE AND WHEN ONE LAD PROPOSED AVISIT TO HIS TURTLETANK SHE WENT WITH AN ALACRITY WHICH CAUSED MAMMATO SMILE UPON HER AS THAT MOTHERLY LADY SETTLED THE CAP WHICH WAS LEFTIN A RUINOUS CONDITION BY FILIAL HUGS BEARLIKE BUT AFFECTIONATE ANDDEARER TO HER THAN THE MOST FAULTLESS COIFFURE FROM THE HANDS OF ANINSPIRED FRENCHWOMAN
LEAVING HER SISTER TO HER OWN DEVICES AMY PROCEEDED TO ENJOY HERSELF TOHER HEARTS CONTENT
 MR
 TUDORS UNCLE HAD MARRIED AN ENGLISH LADY WHOWAS THIRD COUSIN TO A LIVING LORD AND AMY REGARDED THE WHOLE FAMILYWITH GREAT RESPECT FOR IN SPITE OF HER AMERICAN BIRTH AND BREEDINGSHE POSSESSED THAT REVERENCE FOR TITLES WHICH HAUNTS THE BEST OFUSTHAT UNACKNOWLEDGED LOYALTY TO THE EARLY FAITH IN KINGS WHICH SETTHE MOST DEMOCRATIC NATION UNDER THE SUN IN A FERMENT AT THE COMING OF AROYAL YELLOWHAIRED LADDIE SOME YEARS AGO AND WHICH STILL HASSOMETHING TO DO WITH THE LOVE THE YOUNG COUNTRY BEARS THE OLD LIKE THATOF A BIG SON FOR AN IMPERIOUS LITTLE MOTHER WHO HELD HIM WHILE SHECOULD AND LET HIM GO WITH A FAREWELL SCOLDING WHEN HE REBELLED
 BUTEVEN THE SATISFACTION OF TALKING WITH A DISTANT CONNECTION OF THEBRITISH NOBILITY DID NOT RENDER AMY FORGETFUL OF TIME AND WHEN THEPROPER NUMBER OF MINUTES HAD PASSED SHE RELUCTANTLY TORE HERSELF FROMTHIS ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY AND LOOKED ABOUT FOR JO FERVENTLY HOPINGTHAT HER INCORRIGIBLE SISTER WOULD NOT BE FOUND IN ANY POSITION WHICHSHOULD BRING DISGRACE UPON THE NAME OF MARCH
                ILLUSTRATION IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSEIT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSE BUT AMY CONSIDERED IT BAD FOR JO SAT ON THEGRASS WITH AN ENCAMPMENT OF BOYS ABOUT HER AND A DIRTYFOOTED DOGREPOSING ON THE SKIRT OF HER STATE AND FESTIVAL DRESS AS SHE RELATEDONE OF LAURIES PRANKS TO HER ADMIRING AUDIENCE
 ONE SMALL CHILD WASPOKING TURTLES WITH AMYS CHERISHED PARASOL A SECOND WAS EATINGGINGERBREAD OVER JOS BEST BONNET AND A THIRD PLAYING BALL WITH HERGLOVES
 BUT ALL WERE ENJOYING THEMSELVES AND WHEN JO COLLECTED HERDAMAGED PROPERTY TO GO HER ESCORT ACCOMPANIED HER BEGGING HER TO COMEAGAIN IT WAS SUCH FUN TO HEAR ABOUT LAURIES LARKS
CAPITAL BOYS ARENT THEY
 I FEEL QUITE YOUNG AND BRISK AGAIN AFTERTHAT SAID JO STROLLING ALONG WITH HER HANDS BEHIND HER PARTLY FROMHABIT PARTLY TO CONCEAL THE BESPATTERED PARASOL
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS AVOID MR
 TUDOR
 ASKED AMY WISELY REFRAINING FROMANY COMMENT UPON JOS DILAPIDATED APPEARANCE
DONT LIKE HIM HE PUTS ON AIRS SNUBS HIS SISTERS WORRIES HIS FATHERAND DOESNT SPEAK RESPECTFULLY OF HIS MOTHER
 LAURIE SAYS HE IS FASTAND I DONT CONSIDER HIM A DESIRABLE ACQUAINTANCE SO I LET HIMALONE
YOU MIGHT TREAT HIM CIVILLY AT LEAST
 YOU GAVE HIM A COOL NOD ANDJUST NOW YOU BOWED AND SMILED IN THE POLITEST WAY TO TOMMY CHAMBERLAINWHOSE FATHER KEEPS A GROCERY STORE
 IF YOU HAD JUST REVERSED THE NOD ANDTHE BOW IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT SAID AMY REPROVINGLY
NO IT WOULDNT RETURNED PERVERSE JO I NEITHER LIKE RESPECT NORADMIRE TUDOR THOUGH HIS GRANDFATHERS UNCLES NEPHEWS NIECE WASTHIRD COUSIN TO A LORD
 TOMMY IS POOR AND BASHFUL AND GOOD AND VERYCLEVER I THINK WELL OF HIM AND LIKE TO SHOW THAT I DO FOR HE IS AGENTLEMAN IN SPITE OF THE BROWNPAPER PARCELS
ITS NO USE TRYING TO ARGUE WITH YOU BEGAN AMY
NOT THE LEAST MY DEAR INTERRUPTED JO SO LET US LOOK AMIABLE ANDDROP A CARD HERE AS THE KINGS ARE EVIDENTLY OUT FOR WHICH IM DEEPLYGRATEFUL
THE FAMILY CARDCASE HAVING DONE ITS DUTY THE GIRLS WALKED ON AND JOUTTERED ANOTHER THANKSGIVING ON REACHING THE FIFTH HOUSE AND BEING TOLDTHAT THE YOUNG LADIES WERE ENGAGED
NOW LET US GO HOME AND NEVER MIND AUNT MARCH TODAY
 WE CAN RUN DOWNTHERE ANY TIME AND ITS REALLY A PITY TO TRAIL THROUGH THE DUST IN OURBEST BIBS AND TUCKERS WHEN WE ARE TIRED AND CROSS
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF IF YOU PLEASE
 AUNT LIKES TO HAVE US PAY HER THECOMPLIMENT OF COMING IN STYLE AND MAKING A FORMAL CALL ITS A LITTLETHING TO DO BUT IT GIVES HER PLEASURE AND I DONT BELIEVE IT WILL HURTYOUR THINGS HALF SO MUCH AS LETTING DIRTY DOGS AND CLUMPING BOYS SPOILTHEM
 STOOP DOWN AND LET ME TAKE THE CRUMBS OFF OF YOUR BONNET
WHAT A GOOD GIRL YOU ARE AMY
 SAID JO WITH A REPENTANT GLANCE FROMHER OWN DAMAGED COSTUME TO THAT OF HER SISTER WHICH WAS FRESH ANDSPOTLESS STILL
 I WISH IT WAS AS EASY FOR ME TO DO LITTLE THINGS TOPLEASE PEOPLE AS IT IS FOR YOU
 I THINK OF THEM BUT IT TAKES TOO MUCHTIME TO DO THEM SO I WAIT FOR A CHANCE TO CONFER A GREAT FAVOR AND LETTHE SMALL ONES SLIP BUT THEY TELL BEST IN THE END I FANCY
AMY SMILED AND WAS MOLLIFIED AT ONCE SAYING WITH A MATERNAL AIRWOMEN SHOULD LEARN TO BE AGREEABLE PARTICULARLY POOR ONES FOR THEYHAVE NO OTHER WAY OF REPAYING THE KINDNESSES THEY RECEIVE
 IF YOUDREMEMBER THAT AND PRACTISE IT YOUD BE BETTER LIKED THAN I AM BECAUSETHERE IS MORE OF YOU
IM A CROTCHETY OLD THING AND ALWAYS SHALL BE BUT IM WILLING TO OWNTHAT YOU ARE RIGHT ONLY ITS EASIER FOR ME TO RISK MY LIFE FOR A PERSONTHAN TO BE PLEASANT TO HIM WHEN I DONT FEEL LIKE IT
 ITS A GREATMISFORTUNE TO HAVE SUCH STRONG LIKES AND DISLIKES ISNT IT
ITS A GREATER NOT TO BE ABLE TO HIDE THEM
 I DONT MIND SAYING THAT IDONT APPROVE OF TUDOR ANY MORE THAN YOU DO BUT IM NOT CALLED UPON TOTELL HIM SO NEITHER ARE YOU AND THERE IS NO USE IN MAKING YOURSELFDISAGREEABLE BECAUSE HE IS
BUT I THINK GIRLS OUGHT TO SHOW WHEN THEY DISAPPROVE OF YOUNG MEN ANDHOW CAN THEY DO IT EXCEPT BY THEIR MANNERS
 PREACHING DOES NOT DO ANYGOOD AS I KNOW TO MY SORROW SINCE IVE HAD TEDDY TO MANAGE BUT THEREARE MANY LITTLE WAYS IN WHICH I CAN INFLUENCE HIM WITHOUT A WORD AND ISAY WE OUGHT TO DO IT TO OTHERS IF WE CAN
TEDDY IS A REMARKABLE BOY AND CANT BE TAKEN AS A SAMPLE OF OTHERBOYS SAID AMY IN A TONE OF SOLEMN CONVICTION WHICH WOULD HAVECONVULSED THE REMARKABLE BOY IF HE HAD HEARD IT
 IF WE WERE BELLESOR WOMEN OF WEALTH AND POSITION WE MIGHT DO SOMETHING PERHAPS BUT FORUS TO FROWN AT ONE SET OF YOUNG GENTLEMEN BECAUSE WE DONT APPROVE OFTHEM AND SMILE UPON ANOTHER SET BECAUSE WE DO WOULDNT HAVE A PARTICLEOF EFFECT AND WE SHOULD ONLY BE CONSIDERED ODD AND PURITANICAL
SO WE ARE TO COUNTENANCE THINGS AND PEOPLE WHICH WE DETEST MERELYBECAUSE WE ARE NOT BELLES AND MILLIONAIRES ARE WE
 THATS A NICE SORTOF MORALITY
I CANT ARGUE ABOUT IT I ONLY KNOW THAT ITS THE WAY OF THE WORLD ANDPEOPLE WHO SET THEMSELVES AGAINST IT ONLY GET LAUGHED AT FOR THEIRPAINS
 I DONT LIKE REFORMERS AND I HOPE YOU WILL NEVER TRY TO BE ONE
I DO LIKE THEM AND I SHALL BE ONE IF I CAN FOR IN SPITE OF THELAUGHING THE WORLD WOULD NEVER GET ON WITHOUT THEM
 WE CANT AGREEABOUT THAT FOR YOU BELONG TO THE OLD SET AND I TO THE NEW YOU WILLGET ON THE BEST BUT I SHALL HAVE THE LIVELIEST TIME OF IT
 I SHOULDRATHER ENJOY THE BRICKBATS AND HOOTING I THINK
WELL COMPOSE YOURSELF NOW AND DONT WORRY AUNT WITH YOUR NEW IDEAS
ILL TRY NOT TO BUT IM ALWAYS POSSESSED TO BURST OUT WITH SOMEPARTICULARLY BLUNT SPEECH OR REVOLUTIONARY SENTIMENT BEFORE HER ITS MYDOOM AND I CANT HELP IT
THEY FOUND AUNT CARROL WITH THE OLD LADY BOTH ABSORBED IN SOME VERYINTERESTING SUBJECT BUT THEY DROPPED IT AS THE GIRLS CAME IN WITH ACONSCIOUS LOOK WHICH BETRAYED THAT THEY HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT THEIRNIECES
 JO WAS NOT IN A GOOD HUMOR AND THE PERVERSE FIT RETURNED BUTAMY WHO HAD VIRTUOUSLY DONE HER DUTY KEPT HER TEMPER AND PLEASEDEVERYBODY WAS IN A MOST ANGELIC FRAME OF MIND

                             CONSEQUENCES
MRS
 CHESTERS FAIR WAS SO VERY ELEGANT AND SELECT THAT IT WASCONSIDERED A GREAT HONOR BY THE YOUNG LADIES OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO BEINVITED TO TAKE A TABLE AND EVERY ONE WAS MUCH INTERESTED IN THEMATTER
 AMY WAS ASKED BUT JO WAS NOT WHICH WAS FORTUNATE FOR ALLPARTIES AS HER ELBOWS WERE DECIDEDLY AKIMBO AT THIS PERIOD OF HER LIFEAND IT TOOK A GOOD MANY HARD KNOCKS TO TEACH HER HOW TO GET ON EASILY
THE HAUGHTY UNINTERESTING CREATURE WAS LET SEVERELY ALONE BUT AMYSTALENT AND TASTE WERE DULY COMPLIMENTED BY THE OFFER OF THE ARTTABLEAND SHE EXERTED HERSELF TO PREPARE AND SECURE APPROPRIATE AND VALUABLECONTRIBUTIONS TO IT
EVERYTHING WENT ON SMOOTHLY TILL THE DAY BEFORE THE FAIR OPENED THENTHERE OCCURRED ONE OF THE LITTLE SKIRMISHES WHICH IT IS ALMOSTIMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID WHEN SOME FIVE AND TWENTY WOMEN OLD AND YOUNGWITH ALL THEIR PRIVATE PIQUES AND PREJUDICES TRY TO WORK TOGETHER
MAY CHESTER WAS RATHER JEALOUS OF AMY BECAUSE THE LATTER WAS A GREATERFAVORITE THAN HERSELF AND JUST AT THIS TIME SEVERAL TRIFLINGCIRCUMSTANCES OCCURRED TO INCREASE THE FEELING
 AMYS DAINTY PENANDINKWORK ENTIRELY ECLIPSED MAYS PAINTED VASESTHAT WAS ONE THORN THENTHE ALLCONQUERING TUDOR HAD DANCED FOUR TIMES WITH AMY AT A LATEPARTY AND ONLY ONCE WITH MAYTHAT WAS THORN NUMBER TWO BUT THE CHIEFGRIEVANCE THAT RANKLED IN HER SOUL AND GAVE HER AN EXCUSE FOR HERUNFRIENDLY CONDUCT WAS A RUMOR WHICH SOME OBLIGING GOSSIP HAD WHISPEREDTO HER THAT THE MARCH GIRLS HAD MADE FUN OF HER AT THE LAMBS
 ALL THEBLAME OF THIS SHOULD HAVE FALLEN UPON JO FOR HER NAUGHTY IMITATION HADBEEN TOO LIFELIKE TO ESCAPE DETECTION AND THE FROLICSOME LAMBS HADPERMITTED THE JOKE TO ESCAPE
 NO HINT OF THIS HAD REACHED THE CULPRITSHOWEVER AND AMYS DISMAY CAN BE IMAGINED WHEN THE VERY EVENING BEFORETHE FAIR AS SHE WAS PUTTING THE LAST TOUCHES TO HER PRETTY TABLE MRS
CHESTER WHO OF COURSE RESENTED THE SUPPOSED RIDICULE OF HER DAUGHTERSAID IN A BLAND TONE BUT WITH A COLD LOOKI FIND DEAR THAT THERE IS SOME FEELING AMONG THE YOUNG LADIES ABOUTMY GIVING THIS TABLE TO ANY ONE BUT MY GIRLS
 AS THIS IS THE MOSTPROMINENT AND SOME SAY THE MOST ATTRACTIVE TABLE OF ALL AND THEY ARETHE CHIEF GETTERSUP OF THE FAIR IT IS THOUGHT BEST FOR THEM TO TAKETHIS PLACE
 IM SORRY BUT I KNOW YOU ARE TOO SINCERELY INTERESTED INTHE CAUSE TO MIND A LITTLE PERSONAL DISAPPOINTMENT AND YOU SHALL HAVEANOTHER TABLE IF YOU LIKE
MRS
 CHESTER HAD FANCIED BEFOREHAND THAT IT WOULD BE EASY TO DELIVERTHIS LITTLE SPEECH BUT WHEN THE TIME CAME SHE FOUND IT RATHERDIFFICULT TO UTTER IT NATURALLY WITH AMYS UNSUSPICIOUS EYES LOOKINGSTRAIGHT AT HER FULL OF SURPRISE AND TROUBLE
AMY FELT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING BEHIND THIS BUT COULD NOT GUESS WHATAND SAID QUIETLY FEELING HURT AND SHOWING THAT SHE DIDPERHAPS YOU HAD RATHER I TOOK NO TABLE AT ALL
NOW MY DEAR DONT HAVE ANY ILL FEELING I BEG ITS MERELY A MATTEROF EXPEDIENCY YOU SEE MY GIRLS WILL NATURALLY TAKE THE LEAD AND THISTABLE IS CONSIDERED THEIR PROPER PLACE
 I THINK IT VERY APPROPRIATETO YOU AND FEEL VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR EFFORTS TO MAKE IT SO PRETTYBUT WE MUST GIVE UP OUR PRIVATE WISHES OF COURSE AND I WILL SEE THATYOU HAVE A GOOD PLACE ELSEWHERE
 WOULDNT YOU LIKE THE FLOWERTABLE
 THELITTLE GIRLS UNDERTOOK IT BUT THEY ARE DISCOURAGED
 YOU COULD MAKE ACHARMING THING OF IT AND THE FLOWERTABLE IS ALWAYS ATTRACTIVE YOUKNOW
ESPECIALLY TO GENTLEMEN ADDED MAY WITH A LOOK WHICH ENLIGHTENED AMYAS TO ONE CAUSE OF HER SUDDEN FALL FROM FAVOR
 SHE COLORED ANGRILY BUTTOOK NO OTHER NOTICE OF THAT GIRLISH SARCASM AND ANSWERED WITHUNEXPECTED AMIABILITYIT SHALL BE AS YOU PLEASE MRS
 CHESTER
 ILL GIVE UP MY PLACE HERE ATONCE AND ATTEND TO THE FLOWERS IF YOU LIKE
YOU CAN PUT YOUR OWN THINGS ON YOUR OWN TABLE IF YOU PREFER BEGANMAY FEELING A LITTLE CONSCIENCESTRICKEN AS SHE LOOKED AT THE PRETTYRACKS THE PAINTED SHELLS AND QUAINT ILLUMINATIONS AMY HAD SO CAREFULLYMADE AND SO GRACEFULLY ARRANGED
 SHE MEANT IT KINDLY BUT AMY MISTOOKHER MEANING AND SAID QUICKLYOH CERTAINLY IF THEY ARE IN YOUR WAY AND SWEEPING HER CONTRIBUTIONSINTO HER APRON PELLMELL SHE WALKED OFF FEELING THAT HERSELF AND HERWORKS OF ART HAD BEEN INSULTED PAST FORGIVENESS
NOW SHES MAD
 OH DEAR I WISH I HADNT ASKED YOU TO SPEAK MAMMASAID MAY LOOKING DISCONSOLATELY AT THE EMPTY SPACES ON HER TABLE
GIRLS QUARRELS ARE SOON OVER RETURNED HER MOTHER FEELING A TRIFLEASHAMED OF HER OWN PART IN THIS ONE AS WELL SHE MIGHT
THE LITTLE GIRLS HAILED AMY AND HER TREASURES WITH DELIGHT WHICHCORDIAL RECEPTION SOMEWHAT SOOTHED HER PERTURBED SPIRIT AND SHE FELL TOWORK DETERMINED TO SUCCEED FLORALLY IF SHE COULD NOT ARTISTICALLY
 BUTEVERYTHING SEEMED AGAINST HER IT WAS LATE AND SHE WAS TIRED EVERY ONEWAS TOO BUSY WITH THEIR OWN AFFAIRS TO HELP HER AND THE LITTLE GIRLSWERE ONLY HINDRANCES FOR THE DEARS FUSSED AND CHATTERED LIKE SO MANYMAGPIES MAKING A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION IN THEIR ARTLESS EFFORTS TOPRESERVE THE MOST PERFECT ORDER
 THE EVERGREEN ARCH WOULDNT STAY FIRMAFTER SHE GOT IT UP BUT WIGGLED AND THREATENED TO TUMBLE DOWN ON HERHEAD WHEN THE HANGING BASKETS WERE FILLED HER BEST TILE GOT A SPLASH OFWATER WHICH LEFT A SEPIA TEAR ON THE CUPIDS CHEEK SHE BRUISED HERHANDS WITH HAMMERING AND GOT COLD WORKING IN A DRAUGHT WHICH LASTAFFLICTION FILLED HER WITH APPREHENSIONS FOR THE MORROW
 ANY GIRLREADERWHO HAS SUFFERED LIKE AFFLICTIONS WILL SYMPATHIZE WITH POOR AMY ANDWISH HER WELL THROUGH WITH HER TASK
THERE WAS GREAT INDIGNATION AT HOME WHEN SHE TOLD HER STORY THATEVENING
 HER MOTHER SAID IT WAS A SHAME BUT TOLD HER SHE HAD DONERIGHT BETH DECLARED SHE WOULDNT GO TO THE FAIR AT ALL AND JO DEMANDEDWHY SHE DIDNT TAKE ALL HER PRETTY THINGS AND LEAVE THOSE MEAN PEOPLE TOGET ON WITHOUT HER
BECAUSE THEY ARE MEAN IS NO REASON WHY I SHOULD BE
 I HATE SUCH THINGSAND THOUGH I THINK IVE A RIGHT TO BE HURT I DONT INTEND TO SHOW IT
THEY WILL FEEL THAT MORE THAN ANGRY SPEECHES OR HUFFY ACTIONS WONTTHEY MARMEE
THATS THE RIGHT SPIRIT MY DEAR A KISS FOR A BLOW IS ALWAYS BESTTHOUGH ITS NOT VERY EASY TO GIVE IT SOMETIMES SAID HER MOTHER WITHTHE AIR OF ONE WHO HAD LEARNED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PREACHING ANDPRACTISING
IN SPITE OF VARIOUS VERY NATURAL TEMPTATIONS TO RESENT AND RETALIATEAMY ADHERED TO HER RESOLUTION ALL THE NEXT DAY BENT ON CONQUERING HERENEMY BY KINDNESS
 SHE BEGAN WELL THANKS TO A SILENT REMINDER THAT CAMETO HER UNEXPECTEDLY BUT MOST OPPORTUNELY
 AS SHE ARRANGED HER TABLETHAT MORNING WHILE THE LITTLE GIRLS WERE IN AN ANTEROOM FILLING THEBASKETS SHE TOOK UP HER PET PRODUCTIONA LITTLE BOOK THE ANTIQUECOVER OF WHICH HER FATHER HAD FOUND AMONG HIS TREASURES AND IN WHICHON LEAVES OF VELLUM SHE HAD BEAUTIFULLY ILLUMINATED DIFFERENT TEXTS
 ASSHE TURNED THE PAGES RICH IN DAINTY DEVICES WITH VERY PARDONABLEPRIDE HER EYE FELL UPON ONE VERSE THAT MADE HER STOP AND THINK
 FRAMEDIN A BRILLIANT SCROLLWORK OF SCARLET BLUE AND GOLD WITH LITTLESPIRITS OF GOODWILL HELPING ONE ANOTHER UP AND DOWN AMONG THE THORNSAND FLOWERS WERE THE WORDS THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS THYSELF
I OUGHT BUT I DONT THOUGHT AMY AS HER EYE WENT FROM THE BRIGHTPAGE TO MAYS DISCONTENTED FACE BEHIND THE BIG VASES THAT COULD NOTHIDE THE VACANCIES HER PRETTY WORK HAD ONCE FILLED
 AMY STOOD A MINUTETURNING THE LEAVES IN HER HAND READING ON EACH SOME SWEET REBUKE FORALL HEARTBURNINGS AND UNCHARITABLENESS OF SPIRIT
 MANY WISE AND TRUESERMONS ARE PREACHED US EVERY DAY BY UNCONSCIOUS MINISTERS IN STREETSCHOOL OFFICE OR HOME EVEN A FAIRTABLE MAY BECOME A PULPIT IF ITCAN OFFER THE GOOD AND HELPFUL WORDS WHICH ARE NEVER OUT OF SEASON
AMYS CONSCIENCE PREACHED HER A LITTLE SERMON FROM THAT TEXT THEN ANDTHERE AND SHE DID WHAT MANY OF US DO NOT ALWAYS DOTOOK THE SERMON TOHEART AND STRAIGHTWAY PUT IT IN PRACTICE
A GROUP OF GIRLS WERE STANDING ABOUT MAYS TABLE ADMIRING THE PRETTYTHINGS AND TALKING OVER THE CHANGE OF SALESWOMEN
 THEY DROPPED THEIRVOICES BUT AMY KNEW THEY WERE SPEAKING OF HER HEARING ONE SIDE OF THESTORY AND JUDGING ACCORDINGLY
 IT WAS NOT PLEASANT BUT A BETTER SPIRITHAD COME OVER HER AND PRESENTLY A CHANCE OFFERED FOR PROVING IT
 SHEHEARD MAY SAY SORROWFULLYITS TOO BAD FOR THERE IS NO TIME TO MAKE OTHER THINGS AND I DONTWANT TO FILL UP WITH ODDS AND ENDS
 THE TABLE WAS JUST COMPLETE THENNOW ITS SPOILT
I DARE SAY SHED PUT THEM BACK IF YOU ASKED HER SUGGESTED SOME ONE
HOW COULD I AFTER ALL THE FUSS
 BEGAN MAY BUT SHE DID NOT FINISH FORAMYS VOICE CAME ACROSS THE HALL SAYING PLEASANTLYYOU MAY HAVE THEM AND WELCOME WITHOUT ASKING IF YOU WANT THEM
 I WASJUST THINKING ID OFFER TO PUT THEM BACK FOR THEY BELONG TO YOUR TABLERATHER THAN MINE
 HERE THEY ARE PLEASE TAKE THEM AND FORGIVE ME IF IWAS HASTY IN CARRYING THEM AWAY LAST NIGHT
AS SHE SPOKE AMY RETURNED HER CONTRIBUTION WITH A NOD AND A SMILE ANDHURRIED AWAY AGAIN FEELING THAT IT WAS EASIER TO DO A FRIENDLY THINGTHAN IT WAS TO STAY AND BE THANKED FOR IT
NOW I CALL THAT LOVELY OF HER DONT YOU
 CRIED ONE GIRL
MAYS ANSWER WAS INAUDIBLE BUT ANOTHER YOUNG LADY WHOSE TEMPER WASEVIDENTLY A LITTLE SOURED BY MAKING LEMONADE ADDED WITH A DISAGREEABLELAUGH VERY LOVELY FOR SHE KNEW SHE WOULDNT SELL THEM AT HER OWNTABLE
NOW THAT WAS HARD WHEN WE MAKE LITTLE SACRIFICES WE LIKE TO HAVE THEMAPPRECIATED AT LEAST AND FOR A MINUTE AMY WAS SORRY SHE HAD DONE ITFEELING THAT VIRTUE WAS NOT ALWAYS ITS OWN REWARD
 BUT IT ISAS SHEPRESENTLY DISCOVERED FOR HER SPIRITS BEGAN TO RISE AND HER TABLE TOBLOSSOM UNDER HER SKILFUL HANDS THE GIRLS WERE VERY KIND AND THAT ONELITTLE ACT SEEMED TO HAVE CLEARED THE ATMOSPHERE AMAZINGLY
IT WAS A VERY LONG DAY AND A HARD ONE TO AMY AS SHE SAT BEHIND HERTABLE OFTEN QUITE ALONE FOR THE LITTLE GIRLS DESERTED VERY SOON FEWCARED TO BUY FLOWERS IN SUMMER AND HER BOUQUETS BEGAN TO DROOP LONGBEFORE NIGHT
THE ARTTABLE WAS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE IN THE ROOM THERE WAS A CROWDABOUT IT ALL DAY LONG AND THE TENDERS WERE CONSTANTLY FLYING TO AND FROWITH IMPORTANT FACES AND RATTLING MONEYBOXES
 AMY OFTEN LOOKEDWISTFULLY ACROSS LONGING TO BE THERE WHERE SHE FELT AT HOME AND HAPPYINSTEAD OF IN A CORNER WITH NOTHING TO DO
 IT MIGHT SEEM NO HARDSHIP TOSOME OF US BUT TO A PRETTY BLITHE YOUNG GIRL IT WAS NOT ONLY TEDIOUSBUT VERY TRYING AND THE THOUGHT OF BEING FOUND THERE IN THE EVENING BYHER FAMILY AND LAURIE AND HIS FRIENDS MADE IT A REAL MARTYRDOM
SHE DID NOT GO HOME TILL NIGHT AND THEN SHE LOOKED SO PALE AND QUIETTHAT THEY KNEW THE DAY HAD BEEN A HARD ONE THOUGH SHE MADE NOCOMPLAINT AND DID NOT EVEN TELL WHAT SHE HAD DONE
 HER MOTHER GAVE HERAN EXTRA CORDIAL CUP OF TEA BETH HELPED HER DRESS AND MADE A CHARMINGLITTLE WREATH FOR HER HAIR WHILE JO ASTONISHED HER FAMILY BY GETTINGHERSELF UP WITH UNUSUAL CARE AND HINTING DARKLY THAT THE TABLES WEREABOUT TO BE TURNED
DONT DO ANYTHING RUDE PRAY JO

 WASNT THAT FUN GIRLS
 I LIKE TRAVELLING
    I NEVER SHALL GET TO LONDON IF I DONT HURRY
 THE TRIP WAS    LIKE RIDING THROUGH A LONG PICTUREGALLERY FULL OF LOVELY    LANDSCAPES
 THE FARMHOUSES WERE MY DELIGHT WITH THATCHED ROOFS    IVY UP TO THE EAVES LATTICED WINDOWS AND STOUT WOMEN WITH ROSY    CHILDREN AT THE DOORS
 THE VERY CATTLE LOOKED MORE TRANQUIL THAN    OURS AS THEY STOOD KNEEDEEP IN CLOVER AND THE HENS HAD A    CONTENTED CLUCK AS IF THEY NEVER GOT NERVOUS LIKE YANKEE    BIDDIES
 SUCH PERFECT COLOR I NEVER SAWTHE GRASS SO GREEN    SKY SO BLUE GRAIN SO YELLOW WOODS SO DARKI WAS IN A RAPTURE    ALL THE WAY

 GEESE YOUNG    LADIES RETURNS UNCLE IN A TONE THAT KEEPS US QUIET TILL FLO    SETTLES DOWN TO ENJOY THE FLIRTATIONS OF CAPT
 CAVENDISH AND    I HAVE THE SCENERY ALL TO MYSELF
    OF COURSE IT RAINED WHEN WE GOT TO LONDON AND THERE WAS    NOTHING TO BE SEEN BUT FOG AND UMBRELLAS
 WE RESTED UNPACKED    AND SHOPPED A LITTLE BETWEEN THE SHOWERS
 AUNT MARY GOT ME SOME    NEW THINGS FOR I CAME OFF IN SUCH A HURRY I WASNT HALF READY
    A WHITE HAT AND BLUE FEATHER A MUSLIN DRESS TO MATCH AND THE    LOVELIEST MANTLE YOU EVER SAW
 SHOPPING IN REGENT STREET IS    PERFECTLY SPLENDID THINGS SEEM SO CHEAPNICE RIBBONS ONLY    SIXPENCE A YARD
 I LAID IN A STOCK BUT SHALL GET MY GLOVES IN    PARIS
 DOESNT THAT SOUND SORT OF ELEGANT AND RICH
    FLO AND I FOR THE FUN OF IT ORDERED A HANSOM CAB WHILE AUNT    AND UNCLE WERE OUT AND WENT FOR A DRIVE THOUGH WE LEARNED    AFTERWARD THAT IT WASNT THE THING FOR YOUNG LADIES TO RIDE IN    THEM ALONE
 IT WAS SO DROLL
 FOR WHEN WE WERE SHUT IN BY THE    WOODEN APRON THE MAN DROVE SO FAST THAT FLO WAS FRIGHTENED AND    TOLD ME TO STOP HIM
 BUT HE WAS UP OUTSIDE BEHIND SOMEWHERE AND    I COULDNT GET AT HIM
 HE DIDNT HEAR ME CALL NOR SEE ME FLAP    MY PARASOL IN FRONT AND THERE WE WERE QUITE HELPLESS RATTLING    AWAY AND WHIRLING AROUND CORNERS AT A BREAKNECK PACE
 AT LAST    IN MY DESPAIR I SAW A LITTLE DOOR IN THE ROOF AND ON POKING IT    OPEN A RED EYE APPEARED AND A BEERY VOICE SAID    NOW THEN MUM
    I GAVE MY ORDER AS SOBERLY AS I COULD AND SLAMMING DOWN THE    DOOR WITH AN AYE AYE MUM THE MAN MADE HIS HORSE WALK AS    IF GOING TO A FUNERAL
 I POKED AGAIN AND SAID A LITTLE    FASTER THEN OFF HE WENT HELTERSKELTER AS BEFORE AND WE    RESIGNED OURSELVES TO OUR FATE
    TODAY WAS FAIR AND WE WENT TO HYDE PARK CLOSE BY FOR WE ARE    MORE ARISTOCRATIC THAN WE LOOK
 THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE LIVES    NEAR
 I OFTEN SEE HIS FOOTMEN LOUNGING AT THE BACK GATE AND THE    DUKE OF WELLINGTONS HOUSE IS NOT FAR OFF
 SUCH SIGHTS AS I SAW    MY DEAR
 IT WAS AS GOOD AS PUNCH FOR THERE WERE FAT DOWAGERS    ROLLING ABOUT IN THEIR RED AND YELLOW COACHES WITH GORGEOUS    JEAMESES IN SILK STOCKINGS AND VELVET COATS UP BEHIND AND    POWDERED COACHMEN IN FRONT
 SMART MAIDS WITH THE ROSIEST    CHILDREN I EVER SAW HANDSOME GIRLS LOOKING HALF ASLEEP    DANDIES IN QUEER ENGLISH HATS AND LAVENDER KIDS LOUNGING    ABOUT AND TALL SOLDIERS IN SHORT RED JACKETS AND MUFFIN CAPS    STUCK ON ONE SIDE LOOKING SO FUNNY I LONGED TO SKETCH THEM
    ROTTEN ROW MEANS ROUTE DE ROI OR THE KINGS WAY BUT NOW    ITS MORE LIKE A RIDINGSCHOOL THAN ANYTHING ELSE
 THE HORSES    ARE SPLENDID AND THE MEN ESPECIALLY THE GROOMS RIDE WELL BUT    THE WOMEN ARE STIFF AND BOUNCE WHICH ISNT ACCORDING TO OUR    RULES
 I LONGED TO SHOW THEM A TEARING AMERICAN GALLOP FOR THEY    TROTTED SOLEMNLY UP AND DOWN IN THEIR SCANT HABITS AND HIGH    HATS LOOKING LIKE THE WOMEN IN A TOY NOAHS ARK
 EVERY ONE    RIDESOLD MEN STOUT LADIES LITTLE CHILDRENAND THE YOUNG    FOLKS DO A DEAL OF FLIRTING HERE I SAW A PAIR EXCHANGE    ROSEBUDS FOR ITS THE THING TO WEAR ONE IN THE BUTTONHOLE AND    I THOUGHT IT RATHER A NICE LITTLE IDEA

 THEY HAD HEARD    FROM LAURIE WHERE WE WERE TO BE AND CAME TO ASK US TO THEIR    HOUSE BUT UNCLE WONT GO SO WE SHALL RETURN THE CALL AND SEE    THEM AS WE CAN
 THEY WENT TO THE THEATRE WITH US AND WE DID    HAVE SUCH A GOOD TIME FOR FRANK DEVOTED HIMSELF TO FLO AND    FRED AND I TALKED OVER PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE FUN AS IF WE    HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER ALL OUR DAYS
 TELL BETH FRANK ASKED FOR    HER AND WAS SORRY TO HEAR OF HER ILL HEALTH
 FRED LAUGHED WHEN    I SPOKE OF JO AND SENT HIS RESPECTFUL COMPLIMENTS TO THE BIG    HAT
 NEITHER OF THEM HAD FORGOTTEN CAMP LAURENCE OR THE FUN WE    HAD THERE
 WHAT AGES AGO IT SEEMS DOESNT IT

    IN MY LAST I TOLD YOU ABOUT OUR LONDON VISITHOW KIND THE    VAUGHNS WERE AND WHAT PLEASANT PARTIES THEY MADE FOR US
 I    ENJOYED THE TRIPS TO HAMPTON COURT AND THE KENSINGTON MUSEUM    MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSEFOR AT HAMPTON I SAW RAPHAELS    CARTOONS AND AT THE MUSEUM ROOMS FULL OF PICTURES BY TURNER    LAWRENCE REYNOLDS HOGARTH AND THE OTHER GREAT CREATURES
 THE    DAY IN RICHMOND PARK WAS CHARMING FOR WE HAD A REGULAR ENGLISH    PICNIC AND I HAD MORE SPLENDID OAKS AND GROUPS OF DEER THAN I    COULD COPY ALSO HEARD A NIGHTINGALE AND SAW LARKS GO UP
 WE    DID LONDON TO OUR HEARTS CONTENT THANKS TO FRED AND FRANK    AND WERE SORRY TO GO AWAY FOR THOUGH ENGLISH PEOPLE ARE SLOW    TO TAKE YOU IN WHEN THEY ONCE MAKE UP THEIR MINDS TO DO IT THEY    CANNOT BE OUTDONE IN HOSPITALITY I THINK
 THE VAUGHNS HOPE TO    MEET US IN ROME NEXT WINTER AND I SHALL BE DREADFULLY    DISAPPOINTED IF THEY DONT FOR GRACE AND I ARE GREAT FRIENDS    AND THE BOYS VERY NICE FELLOWSESPECIALLY FRED
    WELL WE WERE HARDLY SETTLED HERE WHEN HE TURNED UP AGAIN    SAYING HE HAD COME FOR A HOLIDAY AND WAS GOING TO SWITZERLAND
    AUNT LOOKED SOBER AT FIRST BUT HE WAS SO COOL ABOUT IT SHE    COULDNT SAY A WORD AND NOW WE GET ON NICELY AND ARE VERY GLAD    HE CAME FOR HE SPEAKS FRENCH LIKE A NATIVE AND I DONT KNOW    WHAT WE SHOULD DO WITHOUT HIM
 UNCLE DOESNT KNOW TEN WORDS AND    INSISTS ON TALKING ENGLISH VERY LOUD AS IF THAT WOULD MAKE    PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HIM
 AUNTS PRONUNCIATION IS OLDFASHIONED    AND FLO AND I THOUGH WE FLATTERED OURSELVES THAT WE KNEW A GOOD    DEAL FIND WE DONT AND ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO HAVE FRED DO THE    PARLEY VOOING AS UNCLE CALLS IT
    SUCH DELIGHTFUL TIMES AS WE ARE HAVING
 SIGHTSEEING FROM    MORNING TILL NIGHT STOPPING FOR NICE LUNCHES IN THE GAY    CAFÉS AND MEETING WITH ALL SORTS OF DROLL ADVENTURES
 RAINY    DAYS I SPEND IN THE LOUVRE REVELLING IN PICTURES
 JO WOULD TURN    UP HER NAUGHTY NOSE AT SOME OF THE FINEST BECAUSE SHE HAS NO    SOUL FOR ART BUT I HAVE AND IM CULTIVATING EYE AND TASTE AS    FAST AS I CAN
 SHE WOULD LIKE THE RELICS OF GREAT PEOPLE BETTER    FOR IVE SEEN HER NAPOLEONS COCKED HAT AND GRAY COAT HIS    BABYS CRADLE AND HIS OLD TOOTHBRUSH ALSO MARIE ANTOINETTES    LITTLE SHOE THE RING OF SAINT DENIS CHARLEMAGNES SWORD AND    MANY OTHER INTERESTING THINGS
 ILL TALK FOR HOURS ABOUT THEM    WHEN I COME BUT HAVENT TIME TO WRITE
    THE PALAIS ROYALE IS A HEAVENLY PLACESO FULL OF BIJOUTERIE    AND LOVELY THINGS THAT IM NEARLY DISTRACTED BECAUSE I CANT BUY    THEM
 FRED WANTED TO GET ME SOME BUT OF COURSE I DIDNT ALLOW    IT
 THEN THE BOIS AND THE CHAMPS ELYSÉES ARE TRÈS MAGNIFIQUE
    IVE SEEN THE IMPERIAL FAMILY SEVERAL TIMESTHE EMPEROR AN    UGLY HARDLOOKING MAN THE EMPRESS PALE AND PRETTY BUT DRESSED    IN BAD TASTE I THOUGHTPURPLE DRESS GREEN HAT AND YELLOW    GLOVES

 IS A HANDSOME BOY WHO SITS CHATTING TO HIS    TUTOR AND KISSES HIS HAND TO THE PEOPLE AS HE PASSES IN HIS    FOURHORSE BAROUCHE WITH POSTILIONS IN RED SATIN JACKETS AND A    MOUNTED GUARD BEFORE AND BEHIND
      ILLUSTRATION IVE SEEN THE IMPERIAL FAMILY SEVERAL TIMES    WE OFTEN WALK IN THE TUILERIES GARDENS FOR THEY ARE LOVELY    THOUGH THE ANTIQUE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS SUIT ME BETTER
 PÈRE LA    CHAISE IS VERY CURIOUS FOR MANY OF THE TOMBS ARE LIKE SMALL    ROOMS AND LOOKING IN ONE SEES A TABLE WITH IMAGES OR    PICTURES OF THE DEAD AND CHAIRS FOR THE MOURNERS TO SIT IN    WHEN THEY COME TO LAMENT
 THAT IS SO FRENCHY
    OUR ROOMS ARE ON THE RUE DE RIVOLI AND SITTING IN THE    BALCONY WE LOOK UP AND DOWN THE LONG BRILLIANT STREET
 IT IS    SO PLEASANT THAT WE SPEND OUR EVENINGS TALKING THERE WHEN TOO    TIRED WITH OUR DAYS WORK TO GO OUT
 FRED IS VERY ENTERTAINING    AND IS ALTOGETHER THE MOST AGREEABLE YOUNG MAN I EVER    KNEWEXCEPT LAURIE WHOSE MANNERS ARE MORE CHARMING
 I WISH    FRED WAS DARK FOR I DONT FANCY LIGHT MEN HOWEVER THE VAUGHNS    ARE VERY RICH AND COME OF AN EXCELLENT FAMILY SO I WONT FIND    FAULT WITH THEIR YELLOW HAIR AS MY OWN IS YELLOWER
    NEXT WEEK WE ARE OFF TO GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND AND AS WE    SHALL TRAVEL FAST I SHALL ONLY BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU HASTY    LETTERS
 I KEEP MY DIARY AND TRY TO REMEMBER CORRECTLY AND    DESCRIBE CLEARLY ALL THAT I SEE AND ADMIRE AS FATHER ADVISED

    ADIEU I EMBRACE YOU TENDERLY
                     VOTRE AMIE
    MY DEAR MAMMA                                   HEIDELBERG
    HAVING A QUIET HOUR BEFORE WE LEAVE FOR BERNE ILL TRY TO TELL    YOU WHAT HAS HAPPENED FOR SOME OF IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AS YOU    WILL SEE
    THE SAIL UP THE RHINE WAS PERFECT AND I JUST SAT AND ENJOYED    IT WITH ALL MY MIGHT
 GET FATHERS OLD GUIDEBOOKS AND READ    ABOUT IT I HAVENT WORDS BEAUTIFUL ENOUGH TO DESCRIBE IT
 AT    COBLENTZ WE HAD A LOVELY TIME FOR SOME STUDENTS FROM BONN WITH    WHOM FRED GOT ACQUAINTED ON THE BOAT GAVE US A SERENADE
 IT WAS    A MOONLIGHT NIGHT AND ABOUT ONE OCLOCK FLO AND I WERE WAKED    BY THE MOST DELICIOUS MUSIC UNDER OUR WINDOWS
 WE FLEW UP AND    HID BEHIND THE CURTAINS BUT SLY PEEPS SHOWED US FRED AND THE    STUDENTS SINGING AWAY DOWN BELOW
 IT WAS THE MOST ROMANTIC THING    I EVER SAWTHE RIVER THE BRIDGE OF BOATS THE GREAT FORTRESS    OPPOSITE MOONLIGHT EVERYWHERE AND MUSIC FIT TO MELT A HEART OF    STONE
    WHEN THEY WERE DONE WE THREW DOWN SOME FLOWERS AND SAW THEM    SCRAMBLE FOR THEM KISS THEIR HANDS TO THE INVISIBLE LADIES AND    GO LAUGHING AWAYTO SMOKE AND DRINK BEER I SUPPOSE
 NEXT    MORNING FRED SHOWED ME ONE OF THE CRUMPLED FLOWERS IN HIS    VESTPOCKET AND LOOKED VERY SENTIMENTAL
 I LAUGHED AT HIM AND    SAID I DIDNT THROW IT BUT FLO WHICH SEEMED TO DISGUST HIM    FOR HE TOSSED IT OUT OF THE WINDOW AND TURNED SENSIBLE AGAIN
    IM AFRAID IM GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE WITH THAT BOY IT BEGINS TO    LOOK LIKE IT
    THE BATHS AT NASSAU WERE VERY GAY SO WAS BADENBADEN WHERE    FRED LOST SOME MONEY AND I SCOLDED HIM
 HE NEEDS SOME ONE TO    LOOK AFTER HIM WHEN FRANK IS NOT WITH HIM
 KATE SAID ONCE SHE    HOPED HED MARRY SOON AND I QUITE AGREE WITH HER THAT IT WOULD    BE WELL FOR HIM
 FRANKFORT WAS DELIGHTFUL I SAW GOETHES HOUSE    SCHILLERS STATUE AND DANNECKERS FAMOUS ARIADNE
 IT WAS VERY    LOVELY BUT I SHOULD HAVE ENJOYED IT MORE IF I HAD KNOWN THE    STORY BETTER
 I DIDNT LIKE TO ASK AS EVERY ONE KNEW IT OR    PRETENDED THEY DID
 I WISH JO WOULD TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT I    OUGHT TO HAVE READ MORE FOR I FIND I DONT KNOW ANYTHING AND    IT MORTIFIES ME
    NOW COMES THE SERIOUS PARTFOR IT HAPPENED HERE AND FRED IS    JUST GONE
 HE HAS BEEN SO KIND AND JOLLY THAT WE ALL GOT QUITE    FOND OF HIM I NEVER THOUGHT OF ANYTHING BUT A TRAVELLING    FRIENDSHIP TILL THE SERENADE NIGHT
 SINCE THEN IVE BEGUN TO    FEEL THAT THE MOONLIGHT WALKS BALCONY TALKS AND DAILY    ADVENTURES WERE SOMETHING MORE TO HIM THAN FUN
 I HAVENT    FLIRTED MOTHER TRULY BUT REMEMBERED WHAT YOU SAID TO ME AND    HAVE DONE MY VERY BEST
 I CANT HELP IT IF PEOPLE LIKE ME I    DONT TRY TO MAKE THEM AND IT WORRIES ME IF I DONT CARE FOR    THEM THOUGH JO SAYS I HAVENT GOT ANY HEART
 NOW I KNOW MOTHER    WILL SHAKE HER HEAD AND THE GIRLS SAY OH THE MERCENARY    LITTLE WRETCH
 BUT IVE MADE UP MY MIND AND IF FRED ASKS ME    I SHALL ACCEPT HIM THOUGH IM NOT MADLY IN LOVE
 I LIKE HIM    AND WE GET ON COMFORTABLY TOGETHER
 HE IS HANDSOME YOUNG    CLEVER ENOUGH AND VERY RICHEVER SO MUCH RICHER THAN THE    LAURENCES
 I DONT THINK HIS FAMILY WOULD OBJECT AND I SHOULD    BE VERY HAPPY FOR THEY ARE ALL KIND WELLBRED GENEROUS    PEOPLE AND THEY LIKE ME
 FRED AS THE ELDEST TWIN WILL HAVE    THE ESTATE I SUPPOSE AND SUCH A SPLENDID ONE AS IT IS
 A CITY    HOUSE IN A FASHIONABLE STREET NOT SO SHOWY AS OUR BIG HOUSES    BUT TWICE AS COMFORTABLE AND FULL OF SOLID LUXURY SUCH AS    ENGLISH PEOPLE BELIEVE IN
 I LIKE IT FOR ITS GENUINE
 IVE    SEEN THE PLATE THE FAMILY JEWELS THE OLD SERVANTS AND    PICTURES OF THE COUNTRY PLACE WITH ITS PARK GREAT HOUSE    LOVELY GROUNDS AND FINE HORSES
 OH IT WOULD BE ALL I SHOULD    ASK
 AND ID RATHER HAVE IT THAN ANY TITLE SUCH AS GIRLS SNAP UP    SO READILY AND FIND NOTHING BEHIND
 I MAY BE MERCENARY BUT I    HATE POVERTY AND DONT MEAN TO BEAR IT A MINUTE LONGER THAN I    CAN HELP
 ONE OF US MUST MARRY WELL MEG DIDNT JO WONT    BETH CANT YET SO I SHALL AND MAKE EVERYTHING COSEY ALL ROUND
    I WOULDNT MARRY A MAN I HATED OR DESPISED
 YOU MAY BE SURE OF    THAT AND THOUGH FRED IS NOT MY MODEL HERO HE DOES VERY WELL    AND IN TIME I SHOULD GET FOND ENOUGH OF HIM IF HE WAS VERY    FOND OF ME AND LET ME DO JUST AS I LIKED
 SO IVE BEEN TURNING    THE MATTER OVER IN MY MIND THE LAST WEEK FOR IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE    TO HELP SEEING THAT FRED LIKED ME
 HE SAID NOTHING BUT LITTLE    THINGS SHOWED IT HE NEVER GOES WITH FLO ALWAYS GETS ON MY SIDE    OF THE CARRIAGE TABLE OR PROMENADE LOOKS SENTIMENTAL WHEN WE    ARE ALONE AND FROWNS AT ANY ONE ELSE WHO VENTURES TO SPEAK TO    ME
 YESTERDAY AT DINNER WHEN AN AUSTRIAN OFFICER STARED AT US    AND THEN SAID SOMETHING TO HIS FRIENDA RAKISHLOOKING    BARONABOUT EIN WONDERSCHÖNES BLÖNDCHEN FRED LOOKED AS    FIERCE AS A LION AND CUT HIS MEAT SO SAVAGELY IT NEARLY FLEW    OFF HIS PLATE
 HE ISNT ONE OF THE COOL STIFF ENGLISHMEN BUT    IS RATHER PEPPERY FOR HE HAS SCOTCH BLOOD IN HIM AS ONE MIGHT    GUESS FROM HIS BONNIE BLUE EYES
    WELL LAST EVENING WE WENT UP TO THE CASTLE ABOUT SUNSETAT    LEAST ALL OF US BUT FRED WHO WAS TO MEET US THERE AFTER GOING    TO THE POST RESTANTE FOR LETTERS
 WE HAD A CHARMING TIME POKING    ABOUT THE RUINS THE VAULTS WHERE THE MONSTER TUN IS AND THE    BEAUTIFUL GARDENS MADE BY THE ELECTOR LONG AGO FOR HIS ENGLISH    WIFE
 I LIKED THE GREAT TERRACE BEST FOR THE VIEW WAS DIVINE    SO WHILE THE REST WENT TO SEE THE ROOMS INSIDE I SAT THERE    TRYING TO SKETCH THE GRAY STONE LIONS HEAD ON THE WALL WITH    SCARLET WOODBINE SPRAYS HANGING ROUND IT
 I FELT AS IF ID GOT    INTO A ROMANCE SITTING THERE WATCHING THE NECKAR ROLLING    THROUGH THE VALLEY LISTENING TO THE MUSIC OF THE AUSTRIAN BAND    BELOW AND WAITING FOR MY LOVER LIKE A REAL STORYBOOK GIRL
 I    HAD A FEELING THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND I WAS    READY FOR IT
 I DIDNT FEEL BLUSHY OR QUAKEY BUT QUITE COOL    AND ONLY A LITTLE EXCITED
ILLUSTRATION TRYING TO SKETCH THE GRAYSTONE LIONS HEAD ON THE WALL    BY AND BY I HEARD FREDS VOICE AND THEN HE CAME HURRYING    THROUGH THE GREAT ARCH TO FIND ME
 HE LOOKED SO TROUBLED THAT I    FORGOT ALL ABOUT MYSELF AND ASKED WHAT THE MATTER WAS
 HE SAID    HED JUST GOT A LETTER BEGGING HIM TO COME HOME FOR FRANK WAS    VERY ILL SO HE WAS GOING AT ONCE IN THE NIGHT TRAIN AND ONLY    HAD TIME TO SAY GOODBY
 I WAS VERY SORRY FOR HIM AND    DISAPPOINTED FOR MYSELF BUT ONLY FOR A MINUTE BECAUSE HE    SAID AS HE SHOOK HANDSAND SAID IT IN A WAY THAT I COULD NOT    MISTAKEI SHALL SOON COME BACK YOU WONT FORGET ME AMY
    I DIDNT PROMISE BUT I LOOKED AT HIM AND HE SEEMED SATISFIED    AND THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ANYTHING BUT MESSAGES AND GOODBYES    FOR HE WAS OFF IN AN HOUR AND WE ALL MISS HIM VERY MUCH
 I KNOW    HE WANTED TO SPEAK BUT I THINK FROM SOMETHING HE ONCE HINTED    THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS FATHER NOT TO DO ANYTHING OF THE SORT    YET AWHILE FOR HE IS A RASH BOY AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN DREADS A    FOREIGN DAUGHTERINLAW
 WE SHALL SOON MEET IN ROME AND THEN    IF I DONT CHANGE MY MIND ILL SAY YES THANK YOU WHEN HE    SAYS WILL YOU PLEASE
    OF COURSE THIS IS ALL VERY PRIVATE BUT I WISHED YOU TO KNOW    WHAT WAS GOING ON
 DONT BE ANXIOUS ABOUT ME REMEMBER I AM YOUR    PRUDENT AMY AND BE SURE I WILL DO NOTHING RASHLY
 SEND ME AS    MUCH ADVICE AS YOU LIKE ILL USE IT IF I CAN
 I WISH I COULD    SEE YOU FOR A GOOD TALK MARMEE
 LOVE AND TRUST ME
                                    EVER YOUR                 AMY
                                 XXXII
                            TENDER TROUBLES

ITS NOT HER HEALTH THAT TROUBLES ME NOW ITS HER SPIRITS
 IM SURETHERE IS SOMETHING ON HER MIND AND I WANT YOU TO DISCOVER WHAT IT IS
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO MOTHER
SHE SITS ALONE A GOOD DEAL AND DOESNT TALK TO HER FATHER AS MUCH ASSHE USED
 I FOUND HER CRYING OVER THE BABIES THE OTHER DAY

HAPPY WOMAN
 IVE GOT HEAPS
MY DEAR WHAT ARE THEY
ILL SETTLE BETHYS TROUBLES AND THEN ILL TELL YOU MINE
 THEY ARE NOTVERY WEARING SO THEYLL KEEP AND JO STITCHED AWAY WITH A WISE NODWHICH SET HER MOTHERS HEART AT REST ABOUT HER FOR THE PRESENT ATLEAST
WHILE APPARENTLY ABSORBED IN HER OWN AFFAIRS JO WATCHED BETH ANDAFTER MANY CONFLICTING CONJECTURES FINALLY SETTLED UPON ONE WHICHSEEMED TO EXPLAIN THE CHANGE IN HER
 A SLIGHT INCIDENT GAVE JO THE CLUETO THE MYSTERY SHE THOUGHT AND LIVELY FANCY LOVING HEART DID THEREST
 SHE WAS AFFECTING TO WRITE BUSILY ONE SATURDAY AFTERNOON WHEN SHEAND BETH WERE ALONE TOGETHER YET AS SHE SCRIBBLED SHE KEPT HER EYE ONHER SISTER WHO SEEMED UNUSUALLY QUIET
 SITTING AT THE WINDOW BETHSWORK OFTEN DROPPED INTO HER LAP AND SHE LEANED HER HEAD UPON HER HANDIN A DEJECTED ATTITUDE WHILE HER EYES RESTED ON THE DULL AUTUMNALLANDSCAPE
 SUDDENLY SOME ONE PASSED BELOW WHISTLING LIKE AN OPERATICBLACKBIRD AND A VOICE CALLED OUT           ILLUSTRATION SHE LEANED HER HEAD UPON HER HANDSALL SERENE
 COMING IN TONIGHT
BETH STARTED LEANED FORWARD SMILED AND NODDED WATCHED THE PASSERBYTILL HIS QUICK TRAMP DIED AWAY THEN SAID SOFTLY AS IF TO HERSELFHOW STRONG AND WELL AND HAPPY THAT DEAR BOY LOOKS
HUM
 SAID JO STILL INTENT UPON HER SISTERS FACE FOR THE BRIGHTCOLOR FADED AS QUICKLY AS IT CAME THE SMILE VANISHED AND PRESENTLY ATEAR LAY SHINING ON THE WINDOWLEDGE
 BETH WHISKED IT OFF AND GLANCEDAPPREHENSIVELY AT JO BUT SHE WAS SCRATCHING AWAY AT A TREMENDOUS RATEAPPARENTLY ENGROSSED IN OLYMPIAS OATH
 THE INSTANT BETH TURNED JOBEGAN HER WATCH AGAIN SAW BETHS HAND GO QUIETLY TO HER EYES MORE THANONCE AND IN HER HALFAVERTED FACE READ A TENDER SORROW THAT MADE HEROWN EYES FILL
 FEARING TO BETRAY HERSELF SHE SLIPPED AWAY MURMURINGSOMETHING ABOUT NEEDING MORE PAPER
MERCY ON ME BETH LOVES LAURIE
 SHE SAID SITTING DOWN IN HER OWNROOM PALE WITH THE SHOCK OF THE DISCOVERY WHICH SHE BELIEVED SHE HADJUST MADE
 I NEVER DREAMT OF SUCH A THING
 WHAT WILL MOTHER SAY
 IWONDER IF HE THERE JO STOPPED AND TURNED SCARLET WITH A SUDDENTHOUGHT
 IF HE SHOULDNT LOVE BACK AGAIN HOW DREADFUL IT WOULD BE
 HEMUST ILL MAKE HIM
 AND SHE SHOOK HER HEAD THREATENINGLY AT THEPICTURE OF THE MISCHIEVOUSLOOKING BOY LAUGHING AT HER FROM THE WALL
OH DEAR WE ARE GROWING UP WITH A VENGEANCE
 HERES MEG MARRIED AND AMAMMA AMY FLOURISHING AWAY AT PARIS AND BETH IN LOVE
 IM THE ONLY ONETHAT HAS SENSE ENOUGH TO KEEP OUT OF MISCHIEF
 JO THOUGHT INTENTLY FORA MINUTE WITH HER EYES FIXED ON THE PICTURE THEN SHE SMOOTHED OUT HERWRINKLED FOREHEAD AND SAID WITH A DECIDED NOD AT THE FACE OPPOSITENO THANK YOU SIR YOURE VERY CHARMING BUT YOUVE NO MORE STABILITYTHAN A WEATHERCOCK SO YOU NEEDNT WRITE TOUCHING NOTES AND SMILE INTHAT INSINUATING WAY FOR IT WONT DO A BIT OF GOOD AND I WONT HAVEIT
THEN SHE SIGHED AND FELL INTO A REVERIE FROM WHICH SHE DID NOT WAKETILL THE EARLY TWILIGHT SENT HER DOWN TO TAKE NEW OBSERVATIONS WHICHONLY CONFIRMED HER SUSPICION
 THOUGH LAURIE FLIRTED WITH AMY AND JOKEDWITH JO HIS MANNER TO BETH HAD ALWAYS BEEN PECULIARLY KIND AND GENTLEBUT SO WAS EVERYBODYS THEREFORE NO ONE THOUGHT OF IMAGINING THAT HECARED MORE FOR HER THAN FOR THE OTHERS
 INDEED A GENERAL IMPRESSION HADPREVAILED IN THE FAMILY OF LATE THAT OUR BOY WAS GETTING FONDER THANEVER OF JO WHO HOWEVER WOULDNT HEAR A WORD UPON THE SUBJECT ANDSCOLDED VIOLENTLY IF ANY ONE DARED TO SUGGEST IT
 IF THEY HAD KNOWN THEVARIOUS TENDER PASSAGES OF THE PAST YEAR OR RATHER ATTEMPTS AT TENDERPASSAGES WHICH HAD BEEN NIPPED IN THE BUD THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THEIMMENSE SATISFACTION OF SAYING I TOLD YOU SO
 BUT JO HATEDPHILANDERING AND WOULDNT ALLOW IT ALWAYS HAVING A JOKE OR A SMILEREADY AT THE LEAST SIGN OF IMPENDING DANGER
WHEN LAURIE FIRST WENT TO COLLEGE HE FELL IN LOVE ABOUT ONCE A MONTHBUT THESE SMALL FLAMES WERE AS BRIEF AS ARDENT DID NO DAMAGE AND MUCHAMUSED JO WHO TOOK GREAT INTEREST IN THE ALTERNATIONS OF HOPE DESPAIRAND RESIGNATION WHICH WERE CONFIDED TO HER IN THEIR WEEKLYCONFERENCES
 BUT THERE CAME A TIME WHEN LAURIE CEASED TO WORSHIP AT MANYSHRINES HINTED DARKLY AT ONE ALLABSORBING PASSION AND INDULGEDOCCASIONALLY IN BYRONIC FITS OF GLOOM
 THEN HE AVOIDED THE TENDERSUBJECT ALTOGETHER WROTE PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES TO JO TURNED STUDIOUSAND GAVE OUT THAT HE WAS GOING TO DIG INTENDING TO GRADUATE IN ABLAZE OF GLORY
 THIS SUITED THE YOUNG LADY BETTER THAN TWILIGHTCONFIDENCES TENDER PRESSURES OF THE HAND AND ELOQUENT GLANCES OF THEEYE FOR WITH JO BRAIN DEVELOPED EARLIER THAN HEART AND SHE PREFERREDIMAGINARY HEROES TO REAL ONES BECAUSE WHEN TIRED OF THEM THE FORMERCOULD BE SHUT UP IN THE TINKITCHEN TILL CALLED FOR AND THE LATTER WERELESS MANAGEABLE
THINGS WERE IN THIS STATE WHEN THE GRAND DISCOVERY WAS MADE AND JOWATCHED LAURIE THAT NIGHT AS SHE HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE
 IF SHE HAD NOTGOT THE NEW IDEA INTO HER HEAD SHE WOULD HAVE SEEN NOTHING UNUSUAL INTHE FACT THAT BETH WAS VERY QUIET AND LAURIE VERY KIND TO HER
 BUTHAVING GIVEN THE REIN TO HER LIVELY FANCY IT GALLOPED AWAY WITH HER ATA GREAT PACE AND COMMON SENSE BEING RATHER WEAKENED BY A LONG COURSEOF ROMANCE WRITING DID NOT COME TO THE RESCUE
 AS USUAL BETH LAY ONTHE SOFA AND LAURIE SAT IN A LOW CHAIR CLOSE BY AMUSING HER WITH ALLSORTS OF GOSSIP FOR SHE DEPENDED ON HER WEEKLY SPIN AND HE NEVERDISAPPOINTED HER
 BUT THAT EVENING JO FANCIED THAT BETHS EYES RESTEDON THE LIVELY DARK FACE BESIDE HER WITH PECULIAR PLEASURE AND THAT SHELISTENED WITH INTENSE INTEREST TO AN ACCOUNT OF SOME EXCITINGCRICKETMATCH THOUGH THE PHRASES CAUGHT OFF A TICE STUMPED OFF HISGROUND AND THE LEG HIT FOR THREE WERE AS INTELLIGIBLE TO HER ASSANSCRIT
 SHE ALSO FANCIED HAVING SET HER HEART UPON SEEING IT THATSHE SAW A CERTAIN INCREASE OF GENTLENESS IN LAURIES MANNER THAT HEDROPPED HIS VOICE NOW AND THEN LAUGHED LESS THAN USUAL WAS A LITTLEABSENTMINDED AND SETTLED THE AFGHAN OVER BETHS FEET WITH AN ASSIDUITYTHAT WAS REALLY ALMOST TENDER
WHO KNOWS
 STRANGER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED THOUGHT JO AS SHE FUSSEDABOUT THE ROOM
 SHE WILL MAKE QUITE AN ANGEL OF HIM AND HE WILL MAKELIFE DELIGHTFULLY EASY AND PLEASANT FOR THE DEAR IF THEY ONLY LOVE EACHOTHER
 I DONT SEE HOW HE CAN HELP IT AND I DO BELIEVE HE WOULD IF THEREST OF US WERE OUT OF THE WAY
AS EVERY ONE WAS OUT OF THE WAY BUT HERSELF JO BEGAN TO FEEL THATSHE OUGHT TO DISPOSE OF HERSELF WITH ALL SPEED
 BUT WHERE SHOULD SHE GO
AND BURNING TO LAY HERSELF UPON THE SHRINE OF SISTERLY DEVOTION SHE SATDOWN TO SETTLE THAT POINT
NOW THE OLD SOFA WAS A REGULAR PATRIARCH OF A SOFALONG BROADWELLCUSHIONED AND LOW A TRIFLE SHABBY AS WELL IT MIGHT BE FOR THEGIRLS HAD SLEPT AND SPRAWLED ON IT AS BABIES FISHED OVER THE BACK RODEON THE ARMS AND HAD MENAGERIES UNDER IT AS CHILDREN AND RESTED TIREDHEADS DREAMED DREAMS AND LISTENED TO TENDER TALK ON IT AS YOUNG WOMEN
THEY ALL LOVED IT FOR IT WAS A FAMILY REFUGE AND ONE CORNER HAD ALWAYSBEEN JOS FAVORITE LOUNGINGPLACE
 AMONG THE MANY PILLOWS THAT ADORNEDTHE VENERABLE COUCH WAS ONE HARD ROUND COVERED WITH PRICKLYHORSEHAIR AND FURNISHED WITH A KNOBBY BUTTON AT EACH END THISREPULSIVE PILLOW WAS HER ESPECIAL PROPERTY BEING USED AS A WEAPON OFDEFENCE A BARRICADE OR A STERN PREVENTIVE OF TOO MUCH SLUMBER
LAURIE KNEW THIS PILLOW WELL AND HAD CAUSE TO REGARD IT WITH DEEPAVERSION HAVING BEEN UNMERCIFULLY PUMMELLED WITH IT IN FORMER DAYSWHEN ROMPING WAS ALLOWED AND NOW FREQUENTLY DEBARRED BY IT FROM TAKINGTHE SEAT HE MOST COVETED NEXT TO JO IN THE SOFA CORNER
 IF THESAUSAGE AS THEY CALLED IT STOOD ON END IT WAS A SIGN THAT HE MIGHTAPPROACH AND REPOSE BUT IF IT LAY FLAT ACROSS THE SOFA WOE TO THE MANWOMAN OR CHILD WHO DARED DISTURB IT
 THAT EVENING JO FORGOT TOBARRICADE HER CORNER AND HAD NOT BEEN IN HER SEAT FIVE MINUTES BEFOREA MASSIVE FORM APPEARED BESIDE HER AND WITH BOTH ARMS SPREAD OVER THESOFABACK BOTH LONG LEGS STRETCHED OUT BEFORE HIM LAURIE EXCLAIMEDWITH A SIGH OF SATISFACTIONNOW THIS IS FILLING AT THE PRICE
           ILLUSTRATION NOW THIS IS FILLING AT THE PRICENO SLANG SNAPPED JO SLAMMING DOWN THE PILLOW
 BUT IT WAS TOO LATETHERE WAS NO ROOM FOR IT AND COASTING ON TO THE FLOOR IT DISAPPEAREDIN A MOST MYSTERIOUS MANNER
COME JO DONT BE THORNY
 AFTER STUDYING HIMSELF TO A SKELETON ALL THEWEEK A FELLOW DESERVES PETTING AND OUGHT TO GET IT
BETH WILL PET YOU IM BUSY
NO SHES NOT TO BE BOTHERED WITH ME BUT YOU LIKE THAT SORT OF THINGUNLESS YOUVE SUDDENLY LOST YOUR TASTE FOR IT
 HAVE YOU
 DO YOU HATEYOUR BOY AND WANT TO FIRE PILLOWS AT HIM
ANYTHING MORE WHEEDLESOME THAN THAT TOUCHING APPEAL WAS SELDOM HEARDBUT JO QUENCHED HER BOY BY TURNING ON HIM WITH THE STERN QUERYHOW MANY BOUQUETS HAVE YOU SENT MISS RANDAL THIS WEEK

IM GLAD YOU CANT FLIRT ITS REALLY REFRESHING TO SEE A SENSIBLESTRAIGHTFORWARD GIRL WHO CAN BE JOLLY AND KIND WITHOUT MAKING A FOOL OFHERSELF
 BETWEEN OURSELVES JO SOME OF THE GIRLS I KNOW REALLY DO GO ONAT SUCH A RATE IM ASHAMED OF THEM
 THEY DONT MEAN ANY HARM IM SUREBUT IF THEY KNEW HOW WE FELLOWS TALKED ABOUT THEM AFTERWARD THEYD MENDTHEIR WAYS I FANCY
THEY DO THE SAME AND AS THEIR TONGUES ARE THE SHARPEST YOU FELLOWSGET THE WORST OF IT FOR YOU ARE AS SILLY AS THEY EVERY BIT
 IF YOUBEHAVED PROPERLY THEY WOULD BUT KNOWING YOU LIKE THEIR NONSENSE THEYKEEP IT UP AND THEN YOU BLAME THEM

IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HELP LAUGHING AT THE FUNNY CONFLICT BETWEENLAURIES CHIVALROUS RELUCTANCE TO SPEAK ILL OF WOMANKIND AND HIS VERYNATURAL DISLIKE OF THE UNFEMININE FOLLY OF WHICH FASHIONABLE SOCIETYSHOWED HIM MANY SAMPLES
 JO KNEW THAT YOUNG LAURENCE WAS REGARDED AS AMOST ELIGIBLE PARTI BY WORLDLY MAMMAS WAS MUCH SMILED UPON BY THEIRDAUGHTERS AND FLATTERED ENOUGH BY LADIES OF ALL AGES TO MAKE A COXCOMBOF HIM SO SHE WATCHED HIM RATHER JEALOUSLY FEARING HE WOULD BE SPOILTAND REJOICED MORE THAN SHE CONFESSED TO FIND THAT HE STILL BELIEVED INMODEST GIRLS
 RETURNING SUDDENLY TO HER ADMONITORY TONE SHE SAIDDROPPING HER VOICE IF YOU MUST HAVE A WENT TEDDY GO AND DEVOTEYOURSELF TO ONE OF THE PRETTY MODEST GIRLS WHOM YOU DO RESPECT ANDNOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THE SILLY ONES

                                                NEW YORK NOVEMBER
    DEAR MARMEE AND BETH    IM GOING TO WRITE YOU A REGULAR VOLUME FOR IVE GOT HEAPS TO    TELL THOUGH IM NOT A FINE YOUNG LADY TRAVELLING ON THE    CONTINENT
 WHEN I LOST SIGHT OF FATHERS DEAR OLD FACE I FELT A    TRIFLE BLUE AND MIGHT HAVE SHED A BRINY DROP OR TWO IF AN    IRISH LADY WITH FOUR SMALL CHILDREN ALL CRYING MORE OR LESS    HADNT DIVERTED MY MIND FOR I AMUSED MYSELF BY DROPPING    GINGERBREAD NUTS OVER THE SEAT EVERY TIME THEY OPENED THEIR    MOUTHS TO ROAR
    SOON THE SUN CAME OUT AND TAKING IT AS A GOOD OMEN I CLEARED    UP LIKEWISE AND ENJOYED MY JOURNEY WITH ALL MY HEART
    MRS
 KIRKE WELCOMED ME SO KINDLY I FELT AT HOME AT ONCE EVEN    IN THAT BIG HOUSE FULL OF STRANGERS
 SHE GAVE ME A FUNNY LITTLE    SKYPARLORALL SHE HAD BUT THERE IS A STOVE IN IT AND A NICE    TABLE IN A SUNNY WINDOW SO I CAN SIT HERE AND WRITE WHENEVER I    LIKE
 A FINE VIEW AND A CHURCHTOWER OPPOSITE ATONE FOR THE MANY    STAIRS AND I TOOK A FANCY TO MY DEN ON THE SPOT
 THE NURSERY    WHERE I AM TO TEACH AND SEW IS A PLEASANT ROOM NEXT MRS
    KIRKES PRIVATE PARLOR AND THE TWO LITTLE GIRLS ARE PRETTY    CHILDRENRATHER SPOILT I FANCY BUT THEY TOOK TO ME AFTER    TELLING THEM THE SEVEN BAD PIGS AND IVE NO DOUBT I SHALL    MAKE A MODEL GOVERNESS
    I AM TO HAVE MY MEALS WITH THE CHILDREN IF I PREFER IT TO THE    GREAT TABLE AND FOR THE PRESENT I DO FOR I AM BASHFUL    THOUGH NO ONE WILL BELIEVE IT
    NOW MY DEAR MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME SAID MRS
 K
 IN HER    MOTHERLY WAY IM ON THE DRIVE FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AS YOU    MAY SUPPOSE WITH SUCH A FAMILY BUT A GREAT ANXIETY WILL BE OFF    MY MIND IF I KNOW THE CHILDREN ARE SAFE WITH YOU
 MY ROOMS ARE    ALWAYS OPEN TO YOU AND YOUR OWN SHALL BE AS COMFORTABLE AS I    CAN MAKE IT
 THERE ARE SOME PLEASANT PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE IF YOU    FEEL SOCIABLE AND YOUR EVENINGS ARE ALWAYS FREE
 COME TO ME IF    ANYTHING GOES WRONG AND BE AS HAPPY AS YOU CAN
 THERES THE    TEABELL I MUST RUN AND CHANGE MY CAP AND OFF SHE BUSTLED    LEAVING ME TO SETTLE MYSELF IN MY NEW NEST
    AS I WENT DOWNSTAIRS SOON AFTER I SAW SOMETHING I LIKED
 THE    FLIGHTS ARE VERY LONG IN THIS TALL HOUSE AND AS I STOOD WAITING    AT THE HEAD OF THE THIRD ONE FOR A LITTLE SERVANT GIRL TO LUMBER    UP I SAW A GENTLEMAN COME ALONG BEHIND HER TAKE THE HEAVY HOD    OF COAL OUT OF HER HAND CARRY IT ALL THE WAY UP PUT IT DOWN AT    A DOOR NEAR BY AND WALK AWAY SAYING WITH A KIND NOD AND A    FOREIGN ACCENT    IT GOES BETTER SO
 THE LITTLE BACK IS TOO YOUNG TO HAF SUCH    HEAVINESS
    WASNT IT GOOD OF HIM
 I LIKE SUCH THINGS FOR AS FATHER SAYS    TRIFLES SHOW CHARACTER
 WHEN I MENTIONED IT TO MRS
 K
 THAT    EVENING SHE LAUGHED AND SAID    THAT MUST HAVE BEEN PROFESSOR BHAER HES ALWAYS DOING THINGS    OF THAT SORT
    MRS
 K
 TOLD ME HE WAS FROM BERLIN VERY LEARNED AND GOOD BUT    POOR AS A CHURCHMOUSE AND GIVES LESSONS TO SUPPORT HIMSELF AND    TWO LITTLE ORPHAN NEPHEWS WHOM HE IS EDUCATING HERE ACCORDING    TO THE WISHES OF HIS SISTER WHO MARRIED AN AMERICAN
 NOT A VERY    ROMANTIC STORY BUT IT INTERESTED ME AND I WAS GLAD TO HEAR    THAT MRS
 K
 LENDS HIM HER PARLOR FOR SOME OF HIS SCHOLARS
    THERE IS A GLASS DOOR BETWEEN IT AND THE NURSERY AND I MEAN TO    PEEP AT HIM AND THEN ILL TELL YOU HOW HE LOOKS
 HES ALMOST    FORTY SO ITS NO HARM MARMEE
    AFTER TEA AND A GOTOBED ROMP WITH THE LITTLE GIRLS I    ATTACKED THE BIG WORKBASKET AND HAD A QUIET EVENING CHATTING    WITH MY NEW FRIEND
 I SHALL KEEP A JOURNALLETTER AND SEND IT    ONCE A WEEK SO GOODNIGHT AND MORE TOMORROW
                                                     TUESDAY EVE
    HAD A LIVELY TIME IN MY SEMINARY THIS MORNING FOR THE    CHILDREN ACTED LIKE SANCHO AND AT ONE TIME I REALLY THOUGHT I    SHOULD SHAKE THEM ALL ROUND
 SOME GOOD ANGEL INSPIRED ME TO TRY    GYMNASTICS AND I KEPT IT UP TILL THEY WERE GLAD TO SIT DOWN AND    KEEP STILL
 AFTER LUNCHEON THE GIRL TOOK THEM OUT FOR A WALK    AND I WENT TO MY NEEDLEWORK LIKE LITTLE MABEL WITH A WILLING    MIND
 I WAS THANKING MY STARS THAT ID LEARNED TO MAKE NICE    BUTTONHOLES WHEN THE PARLORDOOR OPENED AND SHUT AND SOME ONE    BEGAN TO HUM                         KENNST DU DAS LAND    LIKE A BIG BUMBLEBEE
 IT WAS DREADFULLY IMPROPER I KNOW BUT I    COULDNT RESIST THE TEMPTATION AND LIFTING ONE END OF THE    CURTAIN BEFORE THE GLASS DOOR I PEEPED IN
 PROFESSOR BHAER WAS    THERE AND WHILE HE ARRANGED HIS BOOKS I TOOK A GOOD LOOK AT    HIM
 A REGULAR GERMANRATHER STOUT WITH BROWN HAIR TUMBLED    ALL OVER HIS HEAD A BUSHY BEARD GOOD NOSE THE KINDEST EYES I    EVER SAW AND A SPLENDID BIG VOICE THAT DOES ONES EARS GOOD    AFTER OUR SHARP OR SLIPSHOD AMERICAN GABBLE
 HIS CLOTHES WERE    RUSTY HIS HANDS WERE LARGE AND HE HADNT A REALLY HANDSOME    FEATURE IN HIS FACE EXCEPT HIS BEAUTIFUL TEETH YET I LIKED    HIM FOR HE HAD A FINE HEAD HIS LINEN WAS VERY NICE AND HE    LOOKED LIKE A GENTLEMAN THOUGH TWO BUTTONS WERE OFF HIS COAT    AND THERE WAS A PATCH ON ONE SHOE
 HE LOOKED SOBER IN SPITE OF    HIS HUMMING TILL HE WENT TO THE WINDOW TO TURN THE HYACINTH    BULBS TOWARD THE SUN AND STROKE THE CAT WHO RECEIVED HIM LIKE    AN OLD FRIEND
 THEN HE SMILED AND WHEN A TAP CAME AT THE DOOR    CALLED OUT IN A LOUD BRISK TONE    HEREIN
    I WAS JUST GOING TO RUN WHEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF A MORSEL OF A    CHILD CARRYING A BIG BOOK AND STOPPED TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON
    ME WANTS MY BHAER SAID THE MITE SLAMMING DOWN HER BOOK AND    RUNNING TO MEET HIM
    THOU SHALT HAF THY BHAER COME THEN AND TAKE A GOOT HUG FROM    HIM MY TINA SAID THE PROFESSOR CATCHING HER UP WITH A    LAUGH AND HOLDING HER SO HIGH OVER HIS HEAD THAT SHE HAD TO    STOOP HER LITTLE FACE TO KISS HIM
                ILLUSTRATION THOU SHALT HAF THY BHAER    NOW ME MUS TUDDY MY LESSIN WENT ON THE FUNNY LITTLE THING    SO HE PUT HER UP AT THE TABLE OPENED THE GREAT DICTIONARY SHE    HAD BROUGHT AND GAVE HER A PAPER AND PENCIL AND SHE SCRIBBLED    AWAY TURNING A LEAF NOW AND THEN AND PASSING HER LITTLE FAT    FINGER DOWN THE PAGE AS IF FINDING A WORD SO SOBERLY THAT I    NEARLY BETRAYED MYSELF BY A LAUGH WHILE MR
 BHAER STOOD    STROKING HER PRETTY HAIR WITH A FATHERLY LOOK THAT MADE ME    THINK SHE MUST BE HIS OWN THOUGH SHE LOOKED MORE FRENCH THAN    GERMAN
    ANOTHER KNOCK AND THE APPEARANCE OF TWO YOUNG LADIES SENT ME    BACK TO MY WORK AND THERE I VIRTUOUSLY REMAINED THROUGH ALL THE    NOISE AND GABBLING THAT WENT ON NEXT DOOR
 ONE OF THE GIRLS KEPT    LAUGHING AFFECTEDLY AND SAYING NOW PROFESSOR IN A    COQUETTISH TONE AND THE OTHER PRONOUNCED HER GERMAN WITH AN    ACCENT THAT MUST HAVE MADE IT HARD FOR HIM TO KEEP SOBER
    BOTH SEEMED TO TRY HIS PATIENCE SORELY FOR MORE THAN ONCE I    HEARD HIM SAY EMPHATICALLY NO NO IT IS NOT SO YOU HAF NOT    ATTEND TO WHAT I SAY AND ONCE THERE WAS A LOUD RAP AS IF HE    STRUCK THE TABLE WITH HIS BOOK FOLLOWED BY THE DESPAIRING    EXCLAMATION PRUT
 IT ALL GOES BAD THIS DAY
    POOR MAN I PITIED HIM AND WHEN THE GIRLS WERE GONE TOOK JUST    ONE MORE PEEP TO SEE IF HE SURVIVED IT
 HE SEEMED TO HAVE    THROWN HIMSELF BACK IN HIS CHAIR TIRED OUT AND SAT THERE WITH    HIS EYES SHUT TILL THE CLOCK STRUCK TWO WHEN HE JUMPED UP PUT    HIS BOOKS IN HIS POCKET AS IF READY FOR ANOTHER LESSON AND    TAKING LITTLE TINA WHO HAD FALLEN ASLEEP ON THE SOFA IN HIS    ARMS HE CARRIED HER QUIETLY AWAY
 I FANCY HE HAS A HARD LIFE OF    IT
    MRS
 KIRKE ASKED ME IF I WOULDNT GO DOWN TO THE FIVE OCLOCK    DINNER AND FEELING A LITTLE BIT HOMESICK I THOUGHT I WOULD    JUST TO SEE WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE ARE UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH ME
    SO I MADE MYSELF RESPECTABLE AND TRIED TO SLIP IN BEHIND MRS
    KIRKE BUT AS SHE IS SHORT AND IM TALL MY EFFORTS AT    CONCEALMENT WERE RATHER A FAILURE
 SHE GAVE ME A SEAT BY HER    AND AFTER MY FACE COOLED OFF I PLUCKED UP COURAGE AND LOOKED    ABOUT ME
 THE LONG TABLE WAS FULL AND EVERY ONE INTENT ON    GETTING THEIR DINNERTHE GENTLEMEN ESPECIALLY WHO SEEMED TO    BE EATING ON TIME FOR THEY BOLTED IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD    VANISHING AS SOON AS THEY WERE DONE
 THERE WAS THE USUAL    ASSORTMENT OF YOUNG MEN ABSORBED IN THEMSELVES YOUNG COUPLES    ABSORBED IN EACH OTHER MARRIED LADIES IN THEIR BABIES AND OLD    GENTLEMEN IN POLITICS
 I DONT THINK I SHALL CARE TO HAVE MUCH    TO DO WITH ANY OF THEM EXCEPT ONE SWEETFACED MAIDEN LADY WHO    LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD SOMETHING IN HER
    CAST AWAY AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE TABLE WAS THE PROFESSOR    SHOUTING ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS OF A VERY INQUISITIVE DEAF    OLD GENTLEMAN ON ONE SIDE AND TALKING PHILOSOPHY WITH A    FRENCHMAN ON THE OTHER
 IF AMY HAD BEEN HERE SHED HAVE TURNED    HER BACK ON HIM FOREVER BECAUSE SAD TO RELATE HE HAD A GREAT    APPETITE AND SHOVELLED IN HIS DINNER IN A MANNER WHICH WOULD    HAVE HORRIFIED HER LADYSHIP
 I DIDNT MIND FOR I LIKE TO SEE    FOLKS EAT WITH A RELISH AS HANNAH SAYS AND THE POOR MAN MUST    HAVE NEEDED A DEAL OF FOOD AFTER TEACHING IDIOTS ALL DAY
    AS I WENT UPSTAIRS AFTER DINNER TWO OF THE YOUNG MEN WERE    SETTLING THEIR HATS BEFORE THE HALLMIRROR AND I HEARD ONE SAY    LOW TO THE OTHER WHOS THE NEW PARTY
    GOVERNESS OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT
    WHAT THE DEUCE IS SHE AT OUR TABLE FOR
    FRIEND OF THE OLD LADYS
    HANDSOME HEAD BUT NO STYLE
    NOT A BIT OF IT
 GIVE US A LIGHT AND COME ON
    I FELT ANGRY AT FIRST AND THEN I DIDNT CARE FOR A GOVERNESS    IS AS GOOD AS A CLERK AND IVE GOT SENSE IF I HAVENT STYLE    WHICH IS MORE THAN SOME PEOPLE HAVE JUDGING FROM THE REMARKS OF    THE ELEGANT BEINGS WHO CLATTERED AWAY SMOKING LIKE BAD    CHIMNEYS
 I HATE ORDINARY PEOPLE
                                                        THURSDAY
    YESTERDAY WAS A QUIET DAY SPENT IN TEACHING SEWING AND    WRITING IN MY LITTLE ROOM WHICH IS VERY COSEY WITH A LIGHT AND    FIRE
 I PICKED UP A FEW BITS OF NEWS AND WAS INTRODUCED TO THE    PROFESSOR
 IT SEEMS THAT TINA IS THE CHILD OF THE FRENCHWOMAN    WHO DOES THE FINE IRONING IN THE LAUNDRY HERE
 THE LITTLE THING    HAS LOST HER HEART TO MR
 BHAER AND FOLLOWS HIM ABOUT THE HOUSE    LIKE A DOG WHENEVER HE IS AT HOME WHICH DELIGHTS HIM AS HE IS    VERY FOND OF CHILDREN THOUGH A BACHELDORE
 KITTY AND MINNIE    KIRKE LIKEWISE REGARD HIM WITH AFFECTION AND TELL ALL SORTS OF    STORIES ABOUT THE PLAYS HE INVENTS THE PRESENTS HE BRINGS AND    THE SPLENDID TALES HE TELLS
 THE YOUNG MEN QUIZ HIM IT SEEMS    CALL HIM OLD FRITZ LAGER BEER URSA MAJOR AND MAKE ALL MANNER    OF JOKES ON HIS NAME
 BUT HE ENJOYS IT LIKE A BOY MRS
 K
 SAYS    AND TAKES IT SO GOODNATUREDLY THAT THEY ALL LIKE HIM IN SPITE    OF HIS FOREIGN WAYS
    THE MAIDEN LADY IS A MISS NORTONRICH CULTIVATED AND KIND
    SHE SPOKE TO ME AT DINNER TODAY FOR I WENT TO TABLE AGAIN    ITS SUCH FUN TO WATCH PEOPLE AND ASKED ME TO COME AND SEE HER    AT HER ROOM
 SHE HAS FINE BOOKS AND PICTURES KNOWS INTERESTING    PERSONS AND SEEMS FRIENDLY SO I SHALL MAKE MYSELF AGREEABLE    FOR I DO WANT TO GET INTO GOOD SOCIETY ONLY IT ISNT THE SAME    SORT THAT AMY LIKES
    I WAS IN OUR PARLOR LAST EVENING WHEN MR
 BHAER CAME IN WITH    SOME NEWSPAPERS FOR MRS
 KIRKE
 SHE WASNT THERE BUT MINNIE    WHO IS A LITTLE OLD WOMAN INTRODUCED ME VERY PRETTILY THIS IS    MAMMAS FRIEND MISS MARCH
    YES AND SHES JOLLY AND WE LIKE HER LOTS ADDED KITTY WHO    IS AN ENFANT TERRIBLE
    WE BOTH BOWED AND THEN WE LAUGHED FOR THE PRIM INTRODUCTION    AND THE BLUNT ADDITION WERE RATHER A COMICAL CONTRAST
    AH YES I HEAR THESE NAUGHTY ONES GO TO VEX YOU MEES MARSCH
    IF SO AGAIN CALL AT ME AND I COME HE SAID WITH A THREATENING    FROWN THAT DELIGHTED THE LITTLE WRETCHES
    I PROMISED I WOULD AND HE DEPARTED BUT IT SEEMS AS IF I WAS    DOOMED TO SEE A GOOD DEAL OF HIM FOR TODAY AS I PASSED HIS    DOOR ON MY WAY OUT BY ACCIDENT I KNOCKED AGAINST IT WITH MY    UMBRELLA
 IT FLEW OPEN AND THERE HE STOOD IN HIS DRESSING GOWN    WITH A BIG BLUE SOCK ON ONE HAND AND A DARNINGNEEDLE IN THE    OTHER HE DIDNT SEEM AT ALL ASHAMED OF IT FOR WHEN I EXPLAINED    AND HURRIED ON HE WAVED HIS HAND SOCK AND ALL SAYING IN HIS    LOUD CHEERFUL WAY            ILLUSTRATION HE WAVED HIS HAND SOCK AND ALL    YOU HAF A FINE DAY TO MAKE YOUR WALK
 BON VOYAGE    MADEMOISELLE
    I LAUGHED ALL THE WAY DOWNSTAIRS BUT IT WAS A LITTLE PATHETIC    ALSO TO THINK OF THE POOR MAN HAVING TO MEND HIS OWN CLOTHES
    THE GERMAN GENTLEMEN EMBROIDER I KNOW BUT DARNING HOSE IS    ANOTHER THING AND NOT SO PRETTY
                                                        SATURDAY
    NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO WRITE ABOUT EXCEPT A CALL ON MISS    NORTON WHO HAS A ROOM FULL OF LOVELY THINGS AND WHO WAS VERY    CHARMING FOR SHE SHOWED ME ALL HER TREASURES AND ASKED ME IF I    WOULD SOMETIMES GO WITH HER TO LECTURES AND CONCERTS AS HER    ESCORTIF I ENJOYED THEM
 SHE PUT IT AS A FAVOR BUT IM SURE    MRS
 KIRKE HAS TOLD HER ABOUT US AND SHE DOES IT OUT OF    KINDNESS TO ME
 IM AS PROUD AS LUCIFER BUT SUCH FAVORS FROM    SUCH PEOPLE DONT BURDEN ME AND I ACCEPTED GRATEFULLY
    WHEN I GOT BACK TO THE NURSERY THERE WAS SUCH AN UPROAR IN THE    PARLOR THAT I LOOKED IN AND THERE WAS MR
 BHAER DOWN ON HIS    HANDS AND KNEES WITH TINA ON HIS BACK KITTY LEADING HIM WITH A    JUMPROPE AND MINNIE FEEDING TWO SMALL BOYS WITH SEEDCAKES AS    THEY ROARED AND RAMPED IN CAGES BUILT OF CHAIRS
    WE ARE PLAYING NARGERIE EXPLAINED KITTY
    DIS IS MINE EFFALUNT
 ADDED TINA HOLDING ON BY THE    PROFESSORS HAIR
                  ILLUSTRATION DIS IS MINE EFFALUNT    MAMMA ALWAYS ALLOWS US TO DO WHAT WE LIKE SATURDAY AFTERNOON    WHEN FRANZ AND EMIL COME DOESNT SHE MR
 BHAER
 SAID    MINNIE
    THE EFFALUNT SAT UP LOOKING AS MUCH IN EARNEST AS ANY OF    THEM AND SAID SOBERLY TO ME    I GIF YOU MY WORT IT IS SO
 IF WE MAKE TOO LARGE A NOISE YOU    SHALL SAY HUSH
 TO US AND WE GO MORE SOFTLY
    I PROMISED TO DO SO BUT LEFT THE DOOR OPEN AND ENJOYED THE    FUN AS MUCH AS THEY DIDFOR A MORE GLORIOUS FROLIC I NEVER    WITNESSED
 THEY PLAYED TAG AND SOLDIERS DANCED AND SUNG AND    WHEN IT BEGAN TO GROW DARK THEY ALL PILED ON TO THE SOFA ABOUT    THE PROFESSOR WHILE HE TOLD CHARMING FAIRY STORIES OF THE    STORKS ON THE CHIMNEYTOPS AND THE LITTLE KOBOLDS WHO RIDE    THE SNOWFLAKES AS THEY FALL
 I WISH AMERICANS WERE AS SIMPLE    AND NATURAL AS GERMANS DONT YOU
    IM SO FOND OF WRITING I SHOULD GO SPINNING ON FOREVER IF    MOTIVES OF ECONOMY DIDNT STOP ME FOR THOUGH IVE USED THIN    PAPER AND WRITTEN FINE I TREMBLE TO THINK OF THE STAMPS THIS    LONG LETTER WILL NEED
 PRAY FORWARD AMYS AS SOON AS YOU CAN    SPARE THEM
 MY SMALL NEWS WILL SOUND VERY FLAT AFTER HER    SPLENDORS BUT YOU WILL LIKE THEM I KNOW

 BLESS YOU
                                                         DECEMBER

 AFTER WHAT AMY WOULD CALL HERCULANEUM EFFORTS IN THE    WAY OF MENTAL AND MORAL AGRICULTURE MY YOUNG IDEAS BEGIN TO    SHOOT AND MY LITTLE TWIGS TO BEND AS I COULD WISH
 THEY ARE NOT    SO INTERESTING TO ME AS TINA AND THE BOYS BUT I DO MY DUTY BY    THEM AND THEY ARE FOND OF ME
 FRANZ AND EMIL ARE JOLLY LITTLE    LADS QUITE AFTER MY OWN HEART FOR THE MIXTURE OF GERMAN AND    AMERICAN SPIRIT IN THEM PRODUCES A CONSTANT STATE OF    EFFERVESCENCE
 SATURDAY AFTERNOONS ARE RIOTOUS TIMES WHETHER    SPENT IN THE HOUSE OR OUT FOR ON PLEASANT DAYS THEY ALL GO TO    WALK LIKE A SEMINARY WITH THE PROFESSOR AND MYSELF TO KEEP    ORDER AND THEN SUCH FUN
    WE ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS NOW AND IVE BEGUN TO TAKE LESSONS
 I    REALLY COULDNT HELP IT AND IT ALL CAME ABOUT IN SUCH A DROLL    WAY THAT I MUST TELL YOU
 TO BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING MRS
 KIRKE    CALLED TO ME ONE DAY AS I PASSED MR
 BHAERS ROOM WHERE SHE    WAS RUMMAGING
    DID YOU EVER SEE SUCH A DEN MY DEAR
 JUST COME AND HELP ME    PUT THESE BOOKS TO RIGHTS FOR IVE TURNED EVERYTHING UPSIDE    DOWN TRYING TO DISCOVER WHAT HE HAS DONE WITH THE SIX NEW    HANDKERCHIEFS I GAVE HIM NOT LONG AGO
    I WENT IN AND WHILE WE WORKED I LOOKED ABOUT ME FOR IT WAS A    DEN TO BE SURE
 BOOKS AND PAPERS EVERYWHERE A BROKEN    MEERSCHAUM AND AN OLD FLUTE OVER THE MANTELPIECE AS IF DONE    WITH A RAGGED BIRD WITHOUT ANY TAIL CHIRPED ON ONE    WINDOWSEAT AND A BOX OF WHITE MICE ADORNED THE OTHER    HALFFINISHED BOATS AND BITS OF STRING LAY AMONG THE    MANUSCRIPTS DIRTY LITTLE BOOTS STOOD DRYING BEFORE THE FIRE    AND TRACES OF THE DEARLY BELOVED BOYS FOR WHOM HE MAKES A SLAVE    OF HIMSELF WERE TO BE SEEN ALL OVER THE ROOM
 AFTER A GRAND    RUMMAGE THREE OF THE MISSING ARTICLES WERE FOUNDONE OVER THE    BIRDCAGE ONE COVERED WITH INK AND A THIRD BURNT BROWN HAVING    BEEN USED AS A HOLDER
    SUCH A MAN
 LAUGHED GOODNATURED MRS
 K
 AS SHE PUT THE    RELICS IN THE RAGBAG
 I SUPPOSE THE OTHERS ARE TORN UP TO RIG    SHIPS BANDAGE CUT FINGERS OR MAKE KITETAILS
 ITS DREADFUL    BUT I CANT SCOLD HIM HES SO ABSENTMINDED AND GOODNATURED    HE LETS THOSE BOYS RIDE OVER HIM ROUGHSHOD
 I AGREED TO DO HIS    WASHING AND MENDING BUT HE FORGETS TO GIVE OUT HIS THINGS AND I    FORGET TO LOOK THEM OVER SO HE COMES TO A SAD PASS SOMETIMES
    LET ME MEND THEM SAID I
 I DONT MIND IT AND HE NEEDNT    KNOW
 ID LIKE TOHES SO KIND TO ME ABOUT BRINGING MY LETTERS    AND LENDING BOOKS
    SO I HAVE GOT HIS THINGS IN ORDER AND KNIT HEELS INTO TWO    PAIRS OF THE SOCKSFOR THEY WERE BOGGLED OUT OF SHAPE WITH HIS    QUEER DARNS
 NOTHING WAS SAID AND I HOPED HE WOULDNT FIND IT    OUT BUT ONE DAY LAST WEEK HE CAUGHT ME AT IT
 HEARING THE    LESSONS HE GIVES TO OTHERS HAS INTERESTED AND AMUSED ME SO MUCH    THAT I TOOK A FANCY TO LEARN FOR TINA RUNS IN AND OUT LEAVING    THE DOOR OPEN AND I CAN HEAR
 I HAD BEEN SITTING NEAR THIS    DOOR FINISHING OFF THE LAST SOCK AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT    HE SAID TO A NEW SCHOLAR WHO IS AS STUPID AS I AM
 THE GIRL HAD    GONE AND I THOUGHT HE HAD ALSO IT WAS SO STILL AND I WAS    BUSILY GABBLING OVER A VERB AND ROCKING TO AND FRO IN A MOST    ABSURD WAY WHEN A LITTLE CROW MADE ME LOOK UP AND THERE WAS    MR
 BHAER LOOKING AND LAUGHING QUIETLY WHILE HE MADE SIGNS TO    TINA NOT TO BETRAY HIM
    SO
 HE SAID AS I STOPPED AND STARED LIKE A GOOSE YOU PEEP    AT ME I PEEP AT YOU AND THAT IS NOT BAD BUT SEE I AM NOT    PLEASANTING WHEN I SAY HAF YOU A WISH FOR GERMAN
    YES BUT YOU ARE TOO BUSY
 I AM TOO STUPID TO LEARN I    BLUNDERED OUT AS RED AS A PEONY
    PRUT
 WE WILL MAKE THE TIME AND WE FAIL NOT TO FIND THE    SENSE
 AT EFENING I SHALL GIF A LITTLE LESSON WITH MUCH    GLADNESS FOR LOOK YOU MEES MARSCH I HAF THIS DEBT TO PAY    AND HE POINTED TO MY WORK
 YES THEY SAY TO ONE ANOTHER THESE    SO KIND LADIES HE IS A STUPID OLD FELLOW HE WILL SEE NOT WHAT    WE DO HE WILL NEVER OPSERVE THAT HIS SOCKHEELS GO NOT IN HOLES    ANY MORE HE WILL THINK HIS BUTTONS GROW OUT NEW WHEN THEY FALL    AND BELIEVE THAT STRINGS MAKE THEIRSELVES
 AH
 BUT I HAF AN    EYE AND I SEE MUCH
 I HAF A HEART AND I FEEL THE THANKS FOR    THIS
 COME A LITTLE LESSON THEN AND NOW OR NO MORE GOOD FAIRY    WORKS FOR ME AND MINE
    OF COURSE I COULDNT SAY ANYTHING AFTER THAT AND AS IT REALLY    IS A SPLENDID OPPORTUNITY I MADE THE BARGAIN AND WE BEGAN
 I    TOOK FOUR LESSONS AND THEN I STUCK FAST IN A GRAMMATICAL BOG
    THE PROFESSOR WAS VERY PATIENT WITH ME BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN    TORMENT TO HIM AND NOW AND THEN HED LOOK AT ME WITH SUCH AN    EXPRESSION OF MILD DESPAIR THAT IT WAS A TOSSUP WITH ME WHETHER    TO LAUGH OR CRY
 I TRIED BOTH WAYS AND WHEN IT CAME TO A SNIFF    OF UTTER MORTIFICATION AND WOE HE JUST THREW THE GRAMMAR ON TO    THE FLOOR AND MARCHED OUT OF THE ROOM
 I FELT MYSELF DISGRACED    AND DESERTED FOREVER BUT DIDNT BLAME HIM A PARTICLE AND WAS    SCRAMBLING MY PAPERS TOGETHER MEANING TO RUSH UPSTAIRS AND    SHAKE MYSELF HARD WHEN IN HE CAME AS BRISK AND BEAMING AS IF    ID COVERED MYSELF WITH GLORY
    NOW WE SHALL TRY A NEW WAY
 YOU AND I WILL READ THESE PLEASANT    LITTLE MÄRCHEN TOGETHER AND DIG NO MORE IN THAT DRY BOOK THAT    GOES IN THE CORNER FOR MAKING US TROUBLE
    HE SPOKE SO KINDLY AND OPENED HANS ANDERSENS FAIRY TALES SO    INVITINGLY BEFORE ME THAT I WAS MORE ASHAMED THAN EVER AND    WENT AT MY LESSON IN A NECKORNOTHING STYLE THAT SEEMED TO    AMUSE HIM IMMENSELY
 I FORGOT MY BASHFULNESS AND PEGGED AWAY    NO OTHER WORD WILL EXPRESS IT WITH ALL MY MIGHT TUMBLING OVER    LONG WORDS PRONOUNCING ACCORDING TO THE INSPIRATION OF THE    MINUTE AND DOING MY VERY BEST
 WHEN I FINISHED READING MY FIRST    PAGE AND STOPPED FOR BREATH HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS AND CRIED    OUT IN HIS HEARTY WAY DAS IST GUTE
 NOW WE GO WELL
 MY TURN
    I DO HIM IN GERMAN GIF ME YOUR EAR
 AND AWAY HE WENT RUMBLING    OUT THE WORDS WITH HIS STRONG VOICE AND A RELISH WHICH WAS GOOD    TO SEE AS WELL AS HEAR
 FORTUNATELY THE STORY WAS THE CONSTANT    TIN SOLDIER WHICH IS DROLL YOU KNOW SO I COULD LAUGHAND I    DIDTHOUGH I DIDNT UNDERSTAND HALF HE READ FOR I COULDNT    HELP IT HE WAS SO EARNEST I SO EXCITED AND THE WHOLE THING SO    COMICAL
    AFTER THAT WE GOT ON BETTER AND NOW I READ MY LESSONS PRETTY    WELL FOR THIS WAY OF STUDYING SUITS ME AND I CAN SEE THAT THE    GRAMMAR GETS TUCKED INTO THE TALES AND POETRY AS ONE GIVES PILLS    IN JELLY
 I LIKE IT VERY MUCH AND HE DOESNT SEEM TIRED OF IT    YETWHICH IS VERY GOOD OF HIM ISNT IT
 I MEAN TO GIVE HIM    SOMETHING ON CHRISTMAS FOR I DARE NOT OFFER MONEY

 YOUR LETTER CAME IN    THE MORNING BUT YOU SAID NOTHING ABOUT A PARCEL MEANING IT    FOR A SURPRISE SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED FOR ID HAD A KIND OF A    FEELING THAT YOU WOULDNT FORGET ME
 I FELT A LITTLE LOW IN MY    MIND AS I SAT UP IN MY ROOM AFTER TEA AND WHEN THE BIG    MUDDY BATTEREDLOOKING BUNDLE WAS BROUGHT TO ME I JUST HUGGED    IT AND PRANCED
 IT WAS SO HOMEY AND REFRESHING THAT I SAT    DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND READ AND LOOKED AND ATE AND LAUGHED AND    CRIED IN MY USUAL ABSURD WAY
 THE THINGS WERE JUST WHAT I    WANTED AND ALL THE BETTER FOR BEING MADE INSTEAD OF BOUGHT

    NOT HAVING MUCH MONEY OR KNOWING WHAT HED LIKE I GOT SEVERAL    LITTLE THINGS AND PUT THEM ABOUT THE ROOM WHERE HE WOULD FIND    THEM UNEXPECTEDLY
 THEY WERE USEFUL PRETTY OR FUNNYA NEW    STANDISH ON HIS TABLE A LITTLE VASE FOR HIS FLOWERHE ALWAYS    HAS ONE OR A BIT OF GREEN IN A GLASS TO KEEP HIM FRESH HE    SAYSAND A HOLDER FOR HIS BLOWER SO THAT HE NEEDNT BURN UP    WHAT AMY CALLS MOUCHOIRS
 I MADE IT LIKE THOSE BETH    INVENTEDA BIG BUTTERFLY WITH A FAT BODY AND BLACK AND YELLOW    WINGS WORSTED FEELERS AND BEAD EYES
 IT TOOK HIS FANCY    IMMENSELY AND HE PUT IT ON HIS MANTELPIECE AS AN ARTICLE OF    VERTU SO IT WAS RATHER A FAILURE AFTER ALL
 POOR AS HE IS HE    DIDNT FORGET A SERVANT OR A CHILD IN THE HOUSE AND NOT A SOUL    HERE FROM THE FRENCH LAUNDRYWOMAN TO MISS NORTON FORGOT HIM
    I WAS SO GLAD OF THAT
    THEY GOT UP A MASQUERADE AND HAD A GAY TIME NEW YEARS EVE
 I    DIDNT MEAN TO GO DOWN HAVING NO DRESS BUT AT THE LAST MINUTE    MRS
 KIRKE REMEMBERED SOME OLD BROCADES AND MISS NORTON LENT ME    LACE AND FEATHERS SO I DRESSED UP AS MRS
 MALAPROP AND SAILED    IN WITH A MASK ON
 NO ONE KNEW ME FOR I DISGUISED MY VOICE AND    NO ONE DREAMED OF THE SILENT HAUGHTY MISS MARCH FOR THEY THINK    I AM VERY STIFF AND COOL MOST OF THEM AND SO I AM TO    WHIPPERSNAPPERS COULD DANCE AND DRESS AND BURST OUT INTO A    NICE DERANGEMENT OF EPITAPHS LIKE AN ALLEGORY ON THE BANKS OF    THE NILE
 I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH AND WHEN WE UNMASKED IT WAS    FUN TO SEE THEM STARE AT ME
 I HEARD ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN TELL    ANOTHER THAT HE KNEW ID BEEN AN ACTRESS IN FACT HE THOUGHT HE    REMEMBERED SEEING ME AT ONE OF THE MINOR THEATRES
 MEG WILL    RELISH THAT JOKE
 MR
 BHAER WAS NICK BOTTOM AND TINA WAS    TITANIAA PERFECT LITTLE FAIRY IN HIS ARMS
 TO SEE THEM DANCE    WAS QUITE A LANDSCAPE TO USE A TEDDYISM
    I HAD A VERY HAPPY NEW YEAR AFTER ALL AND WHEN I THOUGHT IT    OVER IN MY ROOM I FELT AS IF I WAS GETTING ON A LITTLE IN SPITE    OF MY MANY FAILURES FOR IM CHEERFUL ALL THE TIME NOW WORK    WITH A WILL AND TAKE MORE INTEREST IN OTHER PEOPLE THAN I USED    TO WHICH IS SATISFACTORY
 BLESS YOU ALL
 EVER YOUR LOVING                                                                JO

                               A FRIEND
THOUGH VERY HAPPY IN THE SOCIAL ATMOSPHERE ABOUT HER AND VERY BUSY WITHTHE DAILY WORK THAT EARNED HER BREAD AND MADE IT SWEETER FOR THEEFFORT JO STILL FOUND TIME FOR LITERARY LABORS
 THE PURPOSE WHICH NOWTOOK POSSESSION OF HER WAS A NATURAL ONE TO A POOR AND AMBITIOUS GIRLBUT THE MEANS SHE TOOK TO GAIN HER END WERE NOT THE BEST
 SHE SAW THATMONEY CONFERRED POWER MONEY AND POWER THEREFORE SHE RESOLVED TO HAVENOT TO BE USED FOR HERSELF ALONE BUT FOR THOSE WHOM SHE LOVED MORE THANSELF
THE DREAM OF FILLING HOME WITH COMFORTS GIVING BETH EVERYTHING SHEWANTED FROM STRAWBERRIES IN WINTER TO AN ORGAN IN HER BEDROOM GOINGABROAD HERSELF AND ALWAYS HAVING MORE THAN ENOUGH SO THAT SHE MIGHTINDULGE IN THE LUXURY OF CHARITY HAD BEEN FOR YEARS JOS MOST CHERISHEDCASTLE IN THE AIR
THE PRIZESTORY EXPERIENCE HAD SEEMED TO OPEN A WAY WHICH MIGHT AFTERLONG TRAVELLING AND MUCH UPHILL WORK LEAD TO THIS DELIGHTFUL CHÂTEAUEN ESPAGNE
 BUT THE NOVEL DISASTER QUENCHED HER COURAGE FOR A TIME FORPUBLIC OPINION IS A GIANT WHICH HAS FRIGHTENED STOUTERHEARTED JACKS ONBIGGER BEANSTALKS THAN HERS
 LIKE THAT IMMORTAL HERO SHE REPOSEDAWHILE AFTER THE FIRST ATTEMPT WHICH RESULTED IN A TUMBLE AND THELEAST LOVELY OF THE GIANTS TREASURES IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY
 BUT THEUP AGAIN AND TAKE ANOTHER SPIRIT WAS AS STRONG IN JO AS IN JACK SOSHE SCRAMBLED UP ON THE SHADY SIDE THIS TIME AND GOT MORE BOOTY BUTNEARLY LEFT BEHIND HER WHAT WAS FAR MORE PRECIOUS THAN THE MONEYBAGS
SHE TOOK TO WRITING SENSATION STORIES FOR IN THOSE DARK AGES EVENALLPERFECT AMERICA READ RUBBISH
 SHE TOLD NO ONE BUT CONCOCTED ATHRILLING TALE AND BOLDLY CARRIED IT HERSELF TO MR
 DASHWOOD EDITOROF THE WEEKLY VOLCANO
 SHE HAD NEVER READ SARTOR RESARTUS BUT SHEHAD A WOMANLY INSTINCT THAT CLOTHES POSSESS AN INFLUENCE MORE POWERFULOVER MANY THAN THE WORTH OF CHARACTER OR THE MAGIC OF MANNERS
 SO SHEDRESSED HERSELF IN HER BEST AND TRYING TO PERSUADE HERSELF THAT SHEWAS NEITHER EXCITED NOR NERVOUS BRAVELY CLIMBED TWO PAIRS OF DARK ANDDIRTY STAIRS TO FIND HERSELF IN A DISORDERLY ROOM A CLOUD OFCIGARSMOKE AND THE PRESENCE OF THREE GENTLEMEN SITTING WITH THEIRHEELS RATHER HIGHER THAN THEIR HATS WHICH ARTICLES OF DRESS NONE OFTHEM TOOK THE TROUBLE TO REMOVE ON HER APPEARANCE
 SOMEWHAT DAUNTED BYTHIS RECEPTION JO HESITATED ON THE THRESHOLD MURMURING IN MUCHEMBARRASSMENTEXCUSE ME I WAS LOOKING FOR THE WEEKLY VOLCANO OFFICE I WISHED TOSEE MR
 DASHWOOD
DOWN WENT THE HIGHEST PAIR OF HEELS UP ROSE THE SMOKIEST GENTLEMANAND CAREFULLY CHERISHING HIS CIGAR BETWEEN HIS FINGERS HE ADVANCEDWITH A NOD AND A COUNTENANCE EXPRESSIVE OF NOTHING BUT SLEEP
 FEELINGTHAT SHE MUST GET THROUGH THE MATTER SOMEHOW JO PRODUCED HERMANUSCRIPT AND BLUSHING REDDER AND REDDER WITH EACH SENTENCEBLUNDERED OUT FRAGMENTS OF THE LITTLE SPEECH CAREFULLY PREPARED FOR THEOCCASION
A FRIEND OF MINE DESIRED ME TO OFFERA STORYJUST AS ANEXPERIMENTWOULD LIKE YOUR OPINIONBE GLAD TO WRITE MORE IF THISSUITS
WHILE SHE BLUSHED AND BLUNDERED MR
 DASHWOOD HAD TAKEN THE MANUSCRIPTAND WAS TURNING OVER THE LEAVES WITH A PAIR OF RATHER DIRTY FINGERS ANDCASTING CRITICAL GLANCES UP AND DOWN THE NEAT PAGES
NOT A FIRST ATTEMPT I TAKE IT
 OBSERVING THAT THE PAGES WERENUMBERED COVERED ONLY ON ONE SIDE AND NOT TIED UP WITH A RIBBONSURESIGN OF A NOVICE
NO SIR SHE HAS HAD SOME EXPERIENCE AND GOT A PRIZE FOR A TALE IN THEBLARNEYSTONE BANNER
OH DID SHE
 AND MR
 DASHWOOD GAVE JO A QUICK LOOK WHICH SEEMED TOTAKE NOTE OF EVERYTHING SHE HAD ON FROM THE BOW IN HER BONNET TO THEBUTTONS ON HER BOOTS
 WELL YOU CAN LEAVE IT IF YOU LIKE
 WEVE MOREOF THIS SORT OF THING ON HAND THAN WE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH AT PRESENTBUT ILL RUN MY EYE OVER IT AND GIVE YOU AN ANSWER NEXT WEEK
NOW JO DID NOT LIKE TO LEAVE IT FOR MR
 DASHWOOD DIDNT SUIT HER ATALL BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE WAS NOTHING FOR HER TO DO BUTBOW AND WALK AWAY LOOKING PARTICULARLY TALL AND DIGNIFIED AS SHE WASAPT TO DO WHEN NETTLED OR ABASHED
 JUST THEN SHE WAS BOTH FOR IT WASPERFECTLY EVIDENT FROM THE KNOWING GLANCES EXCHANGED AMONG THEGENTLEMEN THAT HER LITTLE FICTION OF MY FRIEND WAS CONSIDERED A GOODJOKE AND A LAUGH PRODUCED BY SOME INAUDIBLE REMARK OF THE EDITOR ASHE CLOSED THE DOOR COMPLETED HER DISCOMFITURE
 HALF RESOLVING NEVER TORETURN SHE WENT HOME AND WORKED OFF HER IRRITATION BY STITCHINGPINAFORES VIGOROUSLY AND IN AN HOUR OR TWO WAS COOL ENOUGH TO LAUGHOVER THE SCENE AND LONG FOR NEXT WEEK
WHEN SHE WENT AGAIN MR
 DASHWOOD WAS ALONE WHEREAT SHE REJOICED MR
DASHWOOD WAS MUCH WIDER AWAKE THAN BEFORE WHICH WAS AGREEABLE AND MR
DASHWOOD WAS NOT TOO DEEPLY ABSORBED IN A CIGAR TO REMEMBER HIS MANNERSSO THE SECOND INTERVIEW WAS MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE THAN THE FIRST
WELL TAKE THIS EDITORS NEVER SAY I IF YOU DONT OBJECT TO A FEWALTERATIONS
 ITS TOO LONG BUT OMITTING THE PASSAGES IVE MARKED WILLMAKE IT JUST THE RIGHT LENGTH HE SAID IN A BUSINESSLIKE TONE
JO HARDLY KNEW HER OWN MS
 AGAIN SO CRUMPLED AND UNDERSCORED WERE ITSPAGES AND PARAGRAPHS BUT FEELING AS A TENDER PARENT MIGHT ON BEINGASKED TO CUT OFF HER BABYS LEGS IN ORDER THAT IT MIGHT FIT INTO A NEWCRADLE SHE LOOKED AT THE MARKED PASSAGES AND WAS SURPRISED TO FINDTHAT ALL THE MORAL REFLECTIONSWHICH SHE HAD CAREFULLY PUT IN ASBALLAST FOR MUCH ROMANCEHAD BEEN STRICKEN OUT
BUT SIR I THOUGHT EVERY STORY SHOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF A MORAL SO ITOOK CARE TO HAVE A FEW OF MY SINNERS REPENT
MR
 DASHWOODS EDITORIAL GRAVITY RELAXED INTO A SMILE FOR JO HADFORGOTTEN HER FRIEND AND SPOKEN AS ONLY AN AUTHOR COULD

JUST AS SHE LIKES OF COURSE
 THE TALE WILL BE OUT NEXT WEEK WILL YOUCALL FOR THE MONEY OR SHALL I SEND IT
 ASKED MR
 DASHWOOD WHO FELT ANATURAL DESIRE TO KNOW WHO HIS NEW CONTRIBUTOR MIGHT BE
ILL CALL
 GOOD MORNING SIR
AS SHE DEPARTED MR
 DASHWOOD PUT UP HIS FEET WITH THE GRACEFUL REMARKPOOR AND PROUD AS USUAL BUT SHELL DO
FOLLOWING MR
 DASHWOODS DIRECTIONS AND MAKING MRS
 NORTHBURY HERMODEL JO RASHLY TOOK A PLUNGE INTO THE FROTHY SEA OF SENSATIONALLITERATURE BUT THANKS TO THE LIFEPRESERVER THROWN HER BY A FRIENDSHE CAME UP AGAIN NOT MUCH THE WORSE FOR HER DUCKING
LIKE MOST YOUNG SCRIBBLERS SHE WENT ABROAD FOR HER CHARACTERS ANDSCENERY AND BANDITTI COUNTS GYPSIES NUNS AND DUCHESSES APPEAREDUPON HER STAGE AND PLAYED THEIR PARTS WITH AS MUCH ACCURACY AND SPIRITAS COULD BE EXPECTED
 HER READERS WERE NOT PARTICULAR ABOUT SUCH TRIFLESAS GRAMMAR PUNCTUATION AND PROBABILITY AND MR
 DASHWOOD GRACIOUSLYPERMITTED HER TO FILL HIS COLUMNS AT THE LOWEST PRICES NOT THINKING ITNECESSARY TO TELL HER THAT THE REAL CAUSE OF HIS HOSPITALITY WAS THEFACT THAT ONE OF HIS HACKS ON BEING OFFERED HIGHER WAGES HAD BASELYLEFT HIM IN THE LURCH
SHE SOON BECAME INTERESTED IN HER WORK FOR HER EMACIATED PURSE GREWSTOUT AND THE LITTLE HOARD SHE WAS MAKING TO TAKE BETH TO THE MOUNTAINSNEXT SUMMER GREW SLOWLY BUT SURELY AS THE WEEKS PASSED
 ONE THINGDISTURBED HER SATISFACTION AND THAT WAS THAT SHE DID NOT TELL THEM ATHOME
 SHE HAD A FEELING THAT FATHER AND MOTHER WOULD NOT APPROVE ANDPREFERRED TO HAVE HER OWN WAY FIRST AND BEG PARDON AFTERWARD
 IT WASEASY TO KEEP HER SECRET FOR NO NAME APPEARED WITH HER STORIES MR
DASHWOOD HAD OF COURSE FOUND IT OUT VERY SOON BUT PROMISED TO BEDUMB AND FOR A WONDER KEPT HIS WORD
SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD DO HER NO HARM FOR SHE SINCERELY MEANT TO WRITENOTHING OF WHICH SHE SHOULD BE ASHAMED AND QUIETED ALL PRICKS OFCONSCIENCE BY ANTICIPATIONS OF THE HAPPY MINUTE WHEN SHE SHOULD SHOW HEREARNINGS AND LAUGH OVER HER WELLKEPT SECRET
BUT MR
 DASHWOOD REJECTED ANY BUT THRILLING TALES AND AS THRILLS COULDNOT BE PRODUCED EXCEPT BY HARROWING UP THE SOULS OF THE READERS HISTORYAND ROMANCE LAND AND SEA SCIENCE AND ART POLICE RECORDS AND LUNATICASYLUMS HAD TO BE RANSACKED FOR THE PURPOSE
 JO SOON FOUND THAT HERINNOCENT EXPERIENCE HAD GIVEN HER BUT FEW GLIMPSES OF THE TRAGIC WORLDWHICH UNDERLIES SOCIETY SO REGARDING IT IN A BUSINESS LIGHT SHE SETABOUT SUPPLYING HER DEFICIENCIES WITH CHARACTERISTIC ENERGY
 EAGER TOFIND MATERIAL FOR STORIES AND BENT ON MAKING THEM ORIGINAL IN PLOT IFNOT MASTERLY IN EXECUTION SHE SEARCHED NEWSPAPERS FOR ACCIDENTSINCIDENTS AND CRIMES SHE EXCITED THE SUSPICIONS OF PUBLIC LIBRARIANSBY ASKING FOR WORKS ON POISONS SHE STUDIED FACES IN THE STREET ANDCHARACTERS GOOD BAD AND INDIFFERENT ALL ABOUT HER SHE DELVED IN THEDUST OF ANCIENT TIMES FOR FACTS OR FICTIONS SO OLD THAT THEY WERE ASGOOD AS NEW AND INTRODUCED HERSELF TO FOLLY SIN AND MISERY AS WELLAS HER LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES ALLOWED
 SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS PROSPERINGFINELY BUT UNCONSCIOUSLY SHE WAS BEGINNING TO DESECRATE SOME OF THEWOMANLIEST ATTRIBUTES OF A WOMANS CHARACTER
 SHE WAS LIVING IN BADSOCIETY AND IMAGINARY THOUGH IT WAS ITS INFLUENCE AFFECTED HER FORSHE WAS FEEDING HEART AND FANCY ON DANGEROUS AND UNSUBSTANTIAL FOOD ANDWAS FAST BRUSHING THE INNOCENT BLOOM FROM HER NATURE BY A PREMATUREACQUAINTANCE WITH THE DARKER SIDE OF LIFE WHICH COMES SOON ENOUGH TOALL OF US
SHE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL RATHER THAN SEE THIS FOR MUCH DESCRIBING OFOTHER PEOPLES PASSIONS AND FEELINGS SET HER TO STUDYING AND SPECULATINGABOUT HER OWNA MORBID AMUSEMENT IN WHICH HEALTHY YOUNG MINDS DO NOTVOLUNTARILY INDULGE
 WRONGDOING ALWAYS BRINGS ITS OWN PUNISHMENT ANDWHEN JO MOST NEEDED HERS SHE GOT IT
I DONT KNOW WHETHER THE STUDY OF SHAKESPEARE HELPED HER TO READCHARACTER OR THE NATURAL INSTINCT OF A WOMAN FOR WHAT WAS HONESTBRAVE AND STRONG BUT WHILE ENDOWING HER IMAGINARY HEROES WITH EVERYPERFECTION UNDER THE SUN JO WAS DISCOVERING A LIVE HERO WHO INTERESTEDHER IN SPITE OF MANY HUMAN IMPERFECTIONS
 MR
 BHAER IN ONE OF THEIRCONVERSATIONS HAD ADVISED HER TO STUDY SIMPLE TRUE AND LOVELYCHARACTERS WHEREVER SHE FOUND THEM AS GOOD TRAINING FOR A WRITER
 JOTOOK HIM AT HIS WORD FOR SHE COOLLY TURNED ROUND AND STUDIED HIMAPROCEEDING WHICH WOULD HAVE MUCH SURPRISED HIM HAD HE KNOWN IT FOR THEWORTHY PROFESSOR WAS VERY HUMBLE IN HIS OWN CONCEIT
WHY EVERYBODY LIKED HIM WAS WHAT PUZZLED JO AT FIRST
 HE WAS NEITHERRICH NOR GREAT YOUNG NOR HANDSOME IN NO RESPECT WHAT IS CALLEDFASCINATING IMPOSING OR BRILLIANT AND YET HE WAS AS ATTRACTIVE AS AGENIAL FIRE AND PEOPLE SEEMED TO GATHER ABOUT HIM AS NATURALLY AS ABOUTA WARM HEARTH
 HE WAS POOR YET ALWAYS APPEARED TO BE GIVING SOMETHINGAWAY A STRANGER YET EVERY ONE WAS HIS FRIEND NO LONGER YOUNG BUT ASHAPPYHEARTED AS A BOY PLAIN AND PECULIAR YET HIS FACE LOOKEDBEAUTIFUL TO MANY AND HIS ODDITIES WERE FREELY FORGIVEN FOR HIS SAKE
JO OFTEN WATCHED HIM TRYING TO DISCOVER THE CHARM AND AT LASTDECIDED THAT IT WAS BENEVOLENCE WHICH WORKED THE MIRACLE
 IF HE HAD ANYSORROW IT SAT WITH ITS HEAD UNDER ITS WING AND HE TURNED ONLY HISSUNNY SIDE TO THE WORLD
 THERE WERE LINES UPON HIS FOREHEAD BUT TIMESEEMED TO HAVE TOUCHED HIM GENTLY REMEMBERING HOW KIND HE WAS TOOTHERS
 THE PLEASANT CURVES ABOUT HIS MOUTH WERE THE MEMORIALS OF MANYFRIENDLY WORDS AND CHEERY LAUGHS HIS EYES WERE NEVER COLD OR HARD ANDHIS BIG HAND HAD A WARM STRONG GRASP THAT WAS MORE EXPRESSIVE THANWORDS
HIS VERY CLOTHES SEEMED TO PARTAKE OF THE HOSPITABLE NATURE OF THEWEARER
 THEY LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE AT EASE AND LIKED TO MAKE HIMCOMFORTABLE HIS CAPACIOUS WAISTCOAT WAS SUGGESTIVE OF A LARGE HEARTUNDERNEATH HIS RUSTY COAT HAD A SOCIAL AIR AND THE BAGGY POCKETSPLAINLY PROVED THAT LITTLE HANDS OFTEN WENT IN EMPTY AND CAME OUT FULLHIS VERY BOOTS WERE BENEVOLENT AND HIS COLLARS NEVER STIFF AND RASPYLIKE OTHER PEOPLES
THATS IT
 SAID JO TO HERSELF WHEN SHE AT LENGTH DISCOVERED THATGENUINE GOODWILL TOWARDS ONES FELLOWMEN COULD BEAUTIFY AND DIGNIFYEVEN A STOUT GERMAN TEACHER WHO SHOVELLED IN HIS DINNER DARNED HIS OWNSOCKS AND WAS BURDENED WITH THE NAME OF BHAER
JO VALUED GOODNESS HIGHLY BUT SHE ALSO POSSESSED A MOST FEMININERESPECT FOR INTELLECT AND A LITTLE DISCOVERY WHICH SHE MADE ABOUT THEPROFESSOR ADDED MUCH TO HER REGARD FOR HIM
 HE NEVER SPOKE OF HIMSELFAND NO ONE EVER KNEW THAT IN HIS NATIVE CITY HE HAD BEEN A MAN MUCHHONORED AND ESTEEMED FOR LEARNING AND INTEGRITY TILL A COUNTRYMAN CAMETO SEE HIM AND IN A CONVERSATION WITH MISS NORTON DIVULGED THEPLEASING FACT
 FROM HER JO LEARNED IT AND LIKED IT ALL THE BETTERBECAUSE MR
 BHAER HAD NEVER TOLD IT
 SHE FELT PROUD TO KNOW THAT HE WASAN HONORED PROFESSOR IN BERLIN THOUGH ONLY A POOR LANGUAGEMASTER INAMERICA AND HIS HOMELY HARDWORKING LIFE WAS MUCH BEAUTIFIED BY THESPICE OF ROMANCE WHICH THIS DISCOVERY GAVE IT
ANOTHER AND A BETTER GIFT THAN INTELLECT WAS SHOWN HER IN A MOSTUNEXPECTED MANNER
 MISS NORTON HAD THE ENTRÉE INTO LITERARY SOCIETYWHICH JO WOULD HAVE HAD NO CHANCE OF SEEING BUT FOR HER
 THE SOLITARYWOMAN FELT AN INTEREST IN THE AMBITIOUS GIRL AND KINDLY CONFERRED MANYFAVORS OF THIS SORT BOTH ON JO AND THE PROFESSOR
 SHE TOOK THEM WITHHER ONE NIGHT TO A SELECT SYMPOSIUM HELD IN HONOR OF SEVERALCELEBRITIES
                   ILLUSTRATION A SELECT SYMPOSIUMJO WENT PREPARED TO BOW DOWN AND ADORE THE MIGHTY ONES WHOM SHE HADWORSHIPPED WITH YOUTHFUL ENTHUSIASM AFAR OFF
 BUT HER REVERENCE FORGENIUS RECEIVED A SEVERE SHOCK THAT NIGHT AND IT TOOK HER SOME TIME TORECOVER FROM THE DISCOVERY THAT THE GREAT CREATURES WERE ONLY MEN ANDWOMEN AFTER ALL
 IMAGINE HER DISMAY ON STEALING A GLANCE OF TIMIDADMIRATION AT THE POET WHOSE LINES SUGGESTED AN ETHEREAL BEING FED ONSPIRIT FIRE AND DEW TO BEHOLD HIM DEVOURING HIS SUPPER WITH ANARDOR WHICH FLUSHED HIS INTELLECTUAL COUNTENANCE
 TURNING AS FROM AFALLEN IDOL SHE MADE OTHER DISCOVERIES WHICH RAPIDLY DISPELLED HERROMANTIC ILLUSIONS
 THE GREAT NOVELIST VIBRATED BETWEEN TWO DECANTERSWITH THE REGULARITY OF A PENDULUM THE FAMOUS DIVINE FLIRTED OPENLY WITHONE OF THE MADAME DE STAËLS OF THE AGE WHO LOOKED DAGGERS AT ANOTHERCORINNE WHO WAS AMIABLY SATIRIZING HER AFTER OUTMANŒUVRING HER INEFFORTS TO ABSORB THE PROFOUND PHILOSOPHER WHO IMBIBED TEA JOHNSONIANLYAND APPEARED TO SLUMBER THE LOQUACITY OF THE LADY RENDERING SPEECHIMPOSSIBLE
 THE SCIENTIFIC CELEBRITIES FORGETTING THEIR MOLLUSKS ANDGLACIAL PERIODS GOSSIPED ABOUT ART WHILE DEVOTING THEMSELVES TOOYSTERS AND ICES WITH CHARACTERISTIC ENERGY THE YOUNG MUSICIAN WHO WASCHARMING THE CITY LIKE A SECOND ORPHEUS TALKED HORSES AND THE SPECIMENOF THE BRITISH NOBILITY PRESENT HAPPENED TO BE THE MOST ORDINARY MAN OFTHE PARTY
BEFORE THE EVENING WAS HALF OVER JO FELT SO COMPLETELY DÉSILLUSIONÉETHAT SHE SAT DOWN IN A CORNER TO RECOVER HERSELF
 MR
 BHAER SOON JOINEDHER LOOKING RATHER OUT OF HIS ELEMENT AND PRESENTLY SEVERAL OF THEPHILOSOPHERS EACH MOUNTED ON HIS HOBBY CAME AMBLING UP TO HOLD ANINTELLECTUAL TOURNAMENT IN THE RECESS
 THE CONVERSATION WAS MILES BEYONDJOS COMPREHENSION BUT SHE ENJOYED IT THOUGH KANT AND HEGEL WEREUNKNOWN GODS THE SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE UNINTELLIGIBLE TERMS AND THEONLY THING EVOLVED FROM HER INNER CONSCIOUSNESS WAS A BAD HEADACHEAFTER IT WAS ALL OVER
 IT DAWNED UPON HER GRADUALLY THAT THE WORLD WASBEING PICKED TO PIECES AND PUT TOGETHER ON NEW AND ACCORDING TO THETALKERS ON INFINITELY BETTER PRINCIPLES THAN BEFORE THAT RELIGION WASIN A FAIR WAY TO BE REASONED INTO NOTHINGNESS AND INTELLECT WAS TO BETHE ONLY GOD
 JO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT PHILOSOPHY OR METAPHYSICS OF ANYSORT BUT A CURIOUS EXCITEMENT HALF PLEASURABLE HALF PAINFUL CAMEOVER HER AS SHE LISTENED WITH A SENSE OF BEING TURNED ADRIFT INTO TIMEAND SPACE LIKE A YOUNG BALLOON OUT ON A HOLIDAY
SHE LOOKED ROUND TO SEE HOW THE PROFESSOR LIKED IT AND FOUND HIMLOOKING AT HER WITH THE GRIMMEST EXPRESSION SHE HAD EVER SEEN HIM WEAR
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND BECKONED HER TO COME AWAY BUT SHE WASFASCINATED JUST THEN BY THE FREEDOM OF SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY ANDKEPT HER SEAT TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT THE WISE GENTLEMEN INTENDED TORELY UPON AFTER THEY HAD ANNIHILATED ALL THE OLD BELIEFS
NOW MR
 BHAER WAS A DIFFIDENT MAN AND SLOW TO OFFER HIS OWN OPINIONSNOT BECAUSE THEY WERE UNSETTLED BUT TOO SINCERE AND EARNEST TO BELIGHTLY SPOKEN
 AS HE GLANCED FROM JO TO SEVERAL OTHER YOUNG PEOPLEATTRACTED BY THE BRILLIANCY OF THE PHILOSOPHIC PYROTECHNICS HE KNIT HISBROWS AND LONGED TO SPEAK FEARING THAT SOME INFLAMMABLE YOUNG SOULWOULD BE LED ASTRAY BY THE ROCKETS TO FIND WHEN THE DISPLAY WAS OVERTHAT THEY HAD ONLY AN EMPTY STICK OR A SCORCHED HAND
HE BORE IT AS LONG AS HE COULD BUT WHEN HE WAS APPEALED TO FOR ANOPINION HE BLAZED UP WITH HONEST INDIGNATION AND DEFENDED RELIGIONWITH ALL THE ELOQUENCE OF TRUTHAN ELOQUENCE WHICH MADE HIS BROKENENGLISH MUSICAL AND HIS PLAIN FACE BEAUTIFUL
 HE HAD A HARD FIGHT FORTHE WISE MEN ARGUED WELL BUT HE DIDNT KNOW WHEN HE WAS BEATEN ANDSTOOD TO HIS COLORS LIKE A MAN
 SOMEHOW AS HE TALKED THE WORLD GOTRIGHT AGAIN TO JO THE OLD BELIEFS THAT HAD LASTED SO LONG SEEMEDBETTER THAN THE NEW GOD WAS NOT A BLIND FORCE AND IMMORTALITY WAS NOTA PRETTY FABLE BUT A BLESSED FACT
 SHE FELT AS IF SHE HAD SOLID GROUNDUNDER HER FEET AGAIN AND WHEN MR
 BHAER PAUSED OUTTALKED BUT NOT ONEWHIT CONVINCED JO WANTED TO CLAP HER HANDS AND THANK HIM
SHE DID NEITHER BUT SHE REMEMBERED THIS SCENE AND GAVE THE PROFESSORHER HEARTIEST RESPECT FOR SHE KNEW IT COST HIM AN EFFORT TO SPEAK OUTTHEN AND THERE BECAUSE HIS CONSCIENCE WOULD NOT LET HIM BE SILENT
 SHEBEGAN TO SEE THAT CHARACTER IS A BETTER POSSESSION THAN MONEY RANKINTELLECT OR BEAUTY AND TO FEEL THAT IF GREATNESS IS WHAT A WISE MANHAS DEFINED IT TO BE TRUTH REVERENCE AND GOODWILL THEN HER FRIENDFRIEDRICH BHAER WAS NOT ONLY GOOD BUT GREAT
THIS BELIEF STRENGTHENED DAILY
 SHE VALUED HIS ESTEEM SHE COVETED HISRESPECT SHE WANTED TO BE WORTHY OF HIS FRIENDSHIP AND JUST WHEN THEWISH WAS SINCEREST SHE CAME NEAR LOSING EVERYTHING
 IT ALL GREW OUT OFA COCKED HAT FOR ONE EVENING THE PROFESSOR CAME IN TO GIVE JO HERLESSON WITH A PAPER SOLDIERCAP ON HIS HEAD WHICH TINA HAD PUT THEREAND HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO TAKE OFF
ITS EVIDENT HE DOESNT LOOK IN HIS GLASS BEFORE COMING DOWN THOUGHTJO WITH A SMILE AS HE SAID GOOT EFENING AND SAT SOBERLY DOWN QUITEUNCONSCIOUS OF THE LUDICROUS CONTRAST BETWEEN HIS SUBJECT AND HISHEADGEAR FOR HE WAS GOING TO READ HER THE DEATH OF WALLENSTEIN
      ILLUSTRATION HE DOESNT PRINK AT HIS GLASS BEFORE COMINGSHE SAID NOTHING AT FIRST FOR SHE LIKED TO HEAR HIM LAUGH OUT HIS BIGHEARTY LAUGH WHEN ANYTHING FUNNY HAPPENED SO SHE LEFT HIM TO DISCOVERIT FOR HIMSELF AND PRESENTLY FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT FOR TO HEAR A GERMANREAD SCHILLER IS RATHER AN ABSORBING OCCUPATION
 AFTER THE READING CAMETHE LESSON WHICH WAS A LIVELY ONE FOR JO WAS IN A GAY MOOD THAT NIGHTAND THE COCKEDHAT KEPT HER EYES DANCING WITH MERRIMENT
 THE PROFESSORDIDNT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF HER AND STOPPED AT LAST TO ASK WITH ANAIR OF MILD SURPRISE THAT WAS IRRESISTIBLEMEES MARSCH FOR WHAT DO YOU LAUGH IN YOUR MASTERS FACE
 HAF YOU NORESPECT FOR ME THAT YOU GO ON SO BAD
HOW CAN I BE RESPECTFUL SIR WHEN YOU FORGET TO TAKE YOUR HAT OFF
SAID JO
LIFTING HIS HAND TO HIS HEAD THE ABSENTMINDED PROFESSOR GRAVELY FELTAND REMOVED THE LITTLE COCKEDHAT LOOKED AT IT A MINUTE AND THEN THREWBACK HIS HEAD AND LAUGHED LIKE A MERRY BASSVIOL
AH
 I SEE HIM NOW IT IS THAT IMP TINA WHO MAKES ME A FOOL WITH MY CAP
WELL IT IS NOTHING BUT SEE YOU IF THIS LESSON GOES NOT WELL YOU TOOSHALL WEAR HIM
BUT THE LESSON DID NOT GO AT ALL FOR A FEW MINUTES BECAUSE MR
 BHAERCAUGHT SIGHT OF A PICTURE ON THE HAT AND UNFOLDING IT SAID WITH ANAIR OF GREAT DISGUSTI WISH THESE PAPERS DID NOT COME IN THE HOUSE THEY ARE NOT FORCHILDREN TO SEE NOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO READ
 IT IS NOT WELL AND I HAF NOPATIENCE WITH THOSE WHO MAKE THIS HARM
JO GLANCED AT THE SHEET AND SAW A PLEASING ILLUSTRATION COMPOSED OF ALUNATIC A CORPSE A VILLAIN AND A VIPER
 SHE DID NOT LIKE IT BUT THEIMPULSE THAT MADE HER TURN IT OVER WAS NOT ONE OF DISPLEASURE BUT FEARBECAUSE FOR A MINUTE SHE FANCIED THE PAPER WAS THE VOLCANO
 IT WASNOT HOWEVER AND HER PANIC SUBSIDED AS SHE REMEMBERED THAT EVEN IF ITHAD BEEN AND ONE OF HER OWN TALES IN IT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO NAMETO BETRAY HER
 SHE HAD BETRAYED HERSELF HOWEVER BY A LOOK AND A BLUSHFOR THOUGH AN ABSENT MAN THE PROFESSOR SAW A GOOD DEAL MORE THANPEOPLE FANCIED
 HE KNEW THAT JO WROTE AND HAD MET HER DOWN AMONG THENEWSPAPER OFFICES MORE THAN ONCE BUT AS SHE NEVER SPOKE OF IT HE ASKEDNO QUESTIONS IN SPITE OF A STRONG DESIRE TO SEE HER WORK
 NOW ITOCCURRED TO HIM THAT SHE WAS DOING WHAT SHE WAS ASHAMED TO OWN AND ITTROUBLED HIM
 HE DID NOT SAY TO HIMSELF IT IS NONE OF MY BUSINESSIVE NO RIGHT TO SAY ANYTHING AS MANY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DONE HE ONLYREMEMBERED THAT SHE WAS YOUNG AND POOR A GIRL FAR AWAY FROM MOTHERSLOVE AND FATHERS CARE AND HE WAS MOVED TO HELP HER WITH AN IMPULSE ASQUICK AND NATURAL AS THAT WHICH WOULD PROMPT HIM TO PUT OUT HIS HAND TOSAVE A BABY FROM A PUDDLE
 ALL THIS FLASHED THROUGH HIS MIND IN AMINUTE BUT NOT A TRACE OF IT APPEARED IN HIS FACE AND BY THE TIME THEPAPER WAS TURNED AND JOS NEEDLE THREADED HE WAS READY TO SAY QUITENATURALLY BUT VERY GRAVELYYES YOU ARE RIGHT TO PUT IT FROM YOU
 I DO NOT LIKE TO THINK THAT GOODYOUNG GIRLS SHOULD SEE SUCH THINGS
 THEY ARE MADE PLEASANT TO SOME BUTI WOULD MORE RATHER GIVE MY BOYS GUNPOWDER TO PLAY WITH THAN THIS BADTRASH
ALL MAY NOT BE BAD ONLY SILLY YOU KNOW AND IF THERE IS A DEMAND FORIT I DONT SEE ANY HARM IN SUPPLYING IT
 MANY VERY RESPECTABLE PEOPLEMAKE AN HONEST LIVING OUT OF WHAT ARE CALLED SENSATION STORIES SAIDJO SCRATCHING GATHERS SO ENERGETICALLY THAT A ROW OF LITTLE SLITSFOLLOWED HER PIN
THERE IS A DEMAND FOR WHISKEY BUT I THINK YOU AND I DO NOT CARE TOSELL IT
 IF THE RESPECTABLE PEOPLE KNEW WHAT HARM THEY DID THEY WOULDNOT FEEL THAT THE LIVING WAS HONEST
 THEY HAF NO RIGHT TO PUT POISONIN THE SUGARPLUM AND LET THE SMALL ONES EAT IT
 NO THEY SHOULD THINKA LITTLE AND SWEEP MUD IN THE STREET BEFORE THEY DO THIS THING
MR
 BHAER SPOKE WARMLY AND WALKED TO THE FIRE CRUMPLING THE PAPER INHIS HANDS
 JO SAT STILL LOOKING AS IF THE FIRE HAD COME TO HER FOR HERCHEEKS BURNED LONG AFTER THE COCKED HAT HAD TURNED TO SMOKE AND GONEHARMLESSLY UP THE CHIMNEY
I SHOULD LIKE MUCH TO SEND ALL THE REST AFTER HIM MUTTERED THEPROFESSOR COMING BACK WITH A RELIEVED AIR
JO THOUGHT WHAT A BLAZE HER PILE OF PAPERS UPSTAIRS WOULD MAKE AND HERHARDEARNED MONEY LAY RATHER HEAVILY ON HER CONSCIENCE AT THAT MINUTE
THEN SHE THOUGHT CONSOLINGLY TO HERSELF MINE ARE NOT LIKE THAT THEYARE ONLY SILLY NEVER BAD SO I WONT BE WORRIED AND TAKING UP HERBOOK SHE SAID WITH A STUDIOUS FACESHALL WE GO ON SIR
 ILL BE VERY GOOD AND PROPER NOW
I SHALL HOPE SO WAS ALL HE SAID BUT HE MEANT MORE THAN SHE IMAGINEDAND THE GRAVE KIND LOOK HE GAVE HER MADE HER FEEL AS IF THE WORDSWEEKLY VOLCANO WERE PRINTED IN LARGE TYPE ON HER FOREHEAD
AS SOON AS SHE WENT TO HER ROOM SHE GOT OUT HER PAPERS AND CAREFULLYREREAD EVERY ONE OF HER STORIES
 BEING A LITTLE SHORTSIGHTED MR
BHAER SOMETIMES USED EYEGLASSES AND JO HAD TRIED THEM ONCE SMILING TOSEE HOW THEY MAGNIFIED THE FINE PRINT OF HER BOOK NOW SHE SEEMED TOHAVE GOT ON THE PROFESSORS MENTAL OR MORAL SPECTACLES ALSO FOR THEFAULTS OF THESE POOR STORIES GLARED AT HER DREADFULLY AND FILLED HERWITH DISMAY
THEY ARE TRASH AND WILL SOON BE WORSE THAN TRASH IF I GO ON FOREACH IS MORE SENSATIONAL THAN THE LAST
 IVE GONE BLINDLY ON HURTINGMYSELF AND OTHER PEOPLE FOR THE SAKE OF MONEY I KNOW ITS SO FOR ICANT READ THIS STUFF IN SOBER EARNEST WITHOUT BEING HORRIBLY ASHAMED OFIT AND WHAT SHOULD I DO IF THEY WERE SEEN AT HOME OR MR
 BHAER GOTHOLD OF THEM
JO TURNED HOT AT THE BARE IDEA AND STUFFED THE WHOLE BUNDLE INTO HERSTOVE NEARLY SETTING THE CHIMNEY AFIRE WITH THE BLAZE
         ILLUSTRATION JO STUFFED THE WHOLE BUNDLE INTO THE STOVEYES THATS THE BEST PLACE FOR SUCH INFLAMMABLE NONSENSE ID BETTERBURN THE HOUSE DOWN I SUPPOSE THAN LET OTHER PEOPLE BLOW THEMSELVES UPWITH MY GUNPOWDER SHE THOUGHT AS SHE WATCHED THE DEMON OF THE JURAWHISK AWAY A LITTLE BLACK CINDER WITH FIERY EYES
BUT WHEN NOTHING REMAINED OF ALL HER THREE MONTHS WORK EXCEPT A HEAP OFASHES AND THE MONEY IN HER LAP JO LOOKED SOBER AS SHE SAT ON THEFLOOR WONDERING WHAT SHE OUGHT TO DO ABOUT HER WAGES
I THINK I HAVENT DONE MUCH HARM YET AND MAY KEEP THIS TO PAY FOR MYTIME SHE SAID AFTER A LONG MEDITATION ADDING IMPATIENTLY I ALMOSTWISH I HADNT ANY CONSCIENCE ITS SO INCONVENIENT
 IF I DIDNT CAREABOUT DOING RIGHT AND DIDNT FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN DOING WRONG ISHOULD GET ON CAPITALLY
 I CANT HELP WISHING SOMETIMES THAT FATHER ANDMOTHER HADNT BEEN SO PARTICULAR ABOUT SUCH THINGS
AH JO INSTEAD OF WISHING THAT THANK GOD THAT FATHER AND MOTHERWERE PARTICULAR AND PITY FROM YOUR HEART THOSE WHO HAVE NO SUCHGUARDIANS TO HEDGE THEM ROUND WITH PRINCIPLES WHICH MAY SEEM LIKEPRISONWALLS TO IMPATIENT YOUTH BUT WHICH WILL PROVE SURE FOUNDATIONSTO BUILD CHARACTER UPON IN WOMANHOOD
JO WROTE NO MORE SENSATIONAL STORIES DECIDING THAT THE MONEY DID NOTPAY FOR HER SHARE OF THE SENSATION BUT GOING TO THE OTHER EXTREME ASIS THE WAY WITH PEOPLE OF HER STAMP SHE TOOK A COURSE OF MRS
 SHERWOODMISS EDGEWORTH AND HANNAH MORE AND THEN PRODUCED A TALE WHICH MIGHTHAVE BEEN MORE PROPERLY CALLED AN ESSAY OR A SERMON SO INTENSELY MORALWAS IT
 SHE HAD HER DOUBTS ABOUT IT FROM THE BEGINNING FOR HER LIVELYFANCY AND GIRLISH ROMANCE FELT AS ILL AT EASE IN THE NEW STYLE AS SHEWOULD HAVE DONE MASQUERADING IN THE STIFF AND CUMBROUS COSTUME OF THELAST CENTURY
 SHE SENT THIS DIDACTIC GEM TO SEVERAL MARKETS BUT ITFOUND NO PURCHASER AND SHE WAS INCLINED TO AGREE WITH MR
 DASHWOODTHAT MORALS DIDNT SELL
THEN SHE TRIED A CHILDS STORY WHICH SHE COULD EASILY HAVE DISPOSED OFIF SHE HAD NOT BEEN MERCENARY ENOUGH TO DEMAND FILTHY LUCRE FOR IT
 THEONLY PERSON WHO OFFERED ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORTH HER WHILE TO TRYJUVENILE LITERATURE WAS A WORTHY GENTLEMAN WHO FELT IT HIS MISSION TOCONVERT ALL THE WORLD TO HIS PARTICULAR BELIEF
 BUT MUCH AS SHE LIKED TOWRITE FOR CHILDREN JO COULD NOT CONSENT TO DEPICT ALL HER NAUGHTY BOYSAS BEING EATEN BY BEARS OR TOSSED BY MAD BULLS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT GOTO A PARTICULAR SABBATHSCHOOL NOR ALL THE GOOD INFANTS WHO DID GO ASREWARDED BY EVERY KIND OF BLISS FROM GILDED GINGERBREAD TO ESCORTS OFANGELS WHEN THEY DEPARTED THIS LIFE WITH PSALMS OR SERMONS ON THEIRLISPING TONGUES
 SO NOTHING CAME OF THESE TRIALS AND JO CORKED UP HERINKSTAND AND SAID IN A FIT OF VERY WHOLESOME HUMILITYI DONT KNOW ANYTHING ILL WAIT TILL I DO BEFORE I TRY AGAIN ANDMEANTIME SWEEP MUD IN THE STREET IF I CANT DO BETTER THATSHONEST AT LEAST WHICH DECISION PROVED THAT HER SECOND TUMBLE DOWN THEBEANSTALK HAD DONE HER SOME GOOD
WHILE THESE INTERNAL REVOLUTIONS WERE GOING ON HER EXTERNAL LIFE HADBEEN AS BUSY AND UNEVENTFUL AS USUAL AND IF SHE SOMETIMES LOOKEDSERIOUS OR A LITTLE SAD NO ONE OBSERVED IT BUT PROFESSOR BHAER
 HE DIDIT SO QUIETLY THAT JO NEVER KNEW HE WAS WATCHING TO SEE IF SHE WOULDACCEPT AND PROFIT BY HIS REPROOF BUT SHE STOOD THE TEST AND HE WASSATISFIED FOR THOUGH NO WORDS PASSED BETWEEN THEM HE KNEW THAT SHEHAD GIVEN UP WRITING
 NOT ONLY DID HE GUESS IT BY THE FACT THAT THESECOND FINGER OF HER RIGHT HAND WAS NO LONGER INKY BUT SHE SPENT HEREVENINGS DOWNSTAIRS NOW WAS MET NO MORE AMONG NEWSPAPER OFFICES ANDSTUDIED WITH A DOGGED PATIENCE WHICH ASSURED HIM THAT SHE WAS BENT ONOCCUPYING HER MIND WITH SOMETHING USEFUL IF NOT PLEASANT
HE HELPED HER IN MANY WAYS PROVING HIMSELF A TRUE FRIEND AND JO WASHAPPY FOR WHILE HER PEN LAY IDLE SHE WAS LEARNING OTHER LESSONSBESIDE GERMAN AND LAYING A FOUNDATION FOR THE SENSATION STORY OF HEROWN LIFE
IT WAS A PLEASANT WINTER AND A LONG ONE FOR SHE DID NOT LEAVE MRS
KIRKE TILL JUNE
 EVERY ONE SEEMED SORRY WHEN THE TIME CAME THE CHILDRENWERE INCONSOLABLE AND MR
 BHAERS HAIR STUCK STRAIGHT UP ALL OVER HISHEAD FOR HE ALWAYS RUMPLED IT WILDLY WHEN DISTURBED IN MIND
GOING HOME
 AH YOU ARE HAPPY THAT YOU HAF A HOME TO GO IN HE SAIDWHEN SHE TOLD HIM AND SAT SILENTLY PULLING HIS BEARD IN THE CORNERWHILE SHE HELD A LITTLE LEVEE ON THAT LAST EVENING
SHE WAS GOING EARLY SO SHE BADE THEM ALL GOODBY OVER NIGHT AND WHENHIS TURN CAME SHE SAID WARMLYNOW SIR YOU WONT FORGET TO COME AND SEE US IF YOU EVER TRAVEL OURWAY WILL YOU
 ILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU IF YOU DO FOR I WANT THEM ALL TOKNOW MY FRIEND

 HE ASKED LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH AN EAGEREXPRESSION WHICH SHE DID NOT SEE
YES COME NEXT MONTH LAURIE GRADUATES THEN AND YOUD ENJOYCOMMENCEMENT AS SOMETHING NEW
THAT IS YOUR BEST FRIEND OF WHOM YOU SPEAK
 HE SAID IN AN ALTEREDTONE
YES MY BOY TEDDY IM VERY PROUD OF HIM AND SHOULD LIKE YOU TO SEEHIM
JO LOOKED UP THEN QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF ANYTHING BUT HER OWN PLEASURE INTHE PROSPECT OF SHOWING THEM TO ONE ANOTHER
 SOMETHING IN MR
 BHAERSFACE SUDDENLY RECALLED THE FACT THAT SHE MIGHT FIND LAURIE MORE THAN ABEST FRIEND AND SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE PARTICULARLY WISHED NOT TO LOOKAS IF ANYTHING WAS THE MATTER SHE INVOLUNTARILY BEGAN TO BLUSH AND THEMORE SHE TRIED NOT TO THE REDDER SHE GREW
 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TINAON HER KNEE SHE DIDNT KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE BECOME OF HER
 FORTUNATELYTHE CHILD WAS MOVED TO HUG HER SO SHE MANAGED TO HIDE HER FACE ANINSTANT HOPING THE PROFESSOR DID NOT SEE IT
 BUT HE DID AND HIS OWNCHANGED AGAIN FROM THAT MOMENTARY ANXIETY TO ITS USUAL EXPRESSION AS HESAID CORDIALLYI FEAR I SHALL NOT MAKE THE TIME FOR THAT BUT I WISH THE FRIEND MUCHSUCCESS AND YOU ALL HAPPINESS
 GOTT BLESS YOU
 AND WITH THAT HE SHOOKHANDS WARMLY SHOULDERED TINA AND WENT AWAY
BUT AFTER THE BOYS WERE ABED HE SAT LONG BEFORE HIS FIRE WITH THETIRED LOOK ON HIS FACE AND THE HEIMWEH OR HOMESICKNESS LYINGHEAVY AT HIS HEART
 ONCE WHEN HE REMEMBERED JO AS SHE SAT WITH THELITTLE CHILD IN HER LAP AND THAT NEW SOFTNESS IN HER FACE HE LEANED HISHEAD ON HIS HANDS A MINUTE AND THEN ROAMED ABOUT THE ROOM AS IF INSEARCH OF SOMETHING THAT HE COULD NOT FIND
IT IS NOT FOR ME I MUST NOT HOPE IT NOW HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITH ASIGH THAT WAS ALMOST A GROAN THEN AS IF REPROACHING HIMSELF FOR THELONGING THAT HE COULD NOT REPRESS HE WENT AND KISSED THE TWO TOWZLEDHEADS UPON THE PILLOW TOOK DOWN HIS SELDOMUSED MEERSCHAUM AND OPENEDHIS PLATO
HE DID HIS BEST AND DID IT MANFULLY BUT I DONT THINK HE FOUND THAT APAIR OF RAMPANT BOYS A PIPE OR EVEN THE DIVINE PLATO WERE VERYSATISFACTORY SUBSTITUTES FOR WIFE AND CHILD AND HOME
EARLY AS IT WAS HE WAS AT THE STATION NEXT MORNING TO SEE JO OFFAND THANKS TO HIM SHE BEGAN HER SOLITARY JOURNEY WITH THE PLEASANTMEMORY OF A FAMILIAR FACE SMILING ITS FAREWELL A BUNCH OF VIOLETS TOKEEP HER COMPANY AND BEST OF ALL THE HAPPY THOUGHTWELL THE WINTERS GONE AND IVE WRITTEN NO BOOKS EARNED NO FORTUNEBUT IVE MADE A FRIEND WORTH HAVING AND ILL TRY TO KEEP HIM ALL MYLIFE

                               HEARTACHE
WHATEVER HIS MOTIVE MIGHT HAVE BEEN LAURIE STUDIED TO SOME PURPOSE THATYEAR FOR HE GRADUATED WITH HONOR AND GAVE THE LATIN ORATION WITH THEGRACE OF A PHILLIPS AND THE ELOQUENCE OF A DEMOSTHENES SO HIS FRIENDSSAID

 A CALLAT MEGS AND A REFRESHING SNIFF AND SIP AT THE DAISY AND DEMIJOHNSTILL FURTHER FORTIFIED HER FOR THE TÊTEÀTÊTE BUT WHEN SHE SAW ASTALWART FIGURE LOOMING IN THE DISTANCE SHE HAD A STRONG DESIRE TO TURNABOUT AND RUN AWAY

SEEING A RAY OF HOPE IN THAT LAST SPEECH LAURIE THREW HIMSELF DOWN ONTHE GRASS AT HER FEET LEANED HIS ARM ON THE LOWER STEP OF THE STILEAND LOOKED UP AT HER WITH AN EXPECTANT FACE
 NOW THAT ARRANGEMENT WASNOT CONDUCIVE TO CALM SPEECH OR CLEAR THOUGHT ON JOS PART FOR HOWCOULD SHE SAY HARD THINGS TO HER BOY WHILE HE WATCHED HER WITH EYESFULL OF LOVE AND LONGING AND LASHES STILL WET WITH THE BITTER DROP ORTWO HER HARDNESS OF HEART HAD WRUNG FROM HIM

THAT SPEECH WAS LIKE FIRE TO GUNPOWDER
 LAURIE LOOKED AT HER A MINUTE ASIF HE DID NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIMSELF THEN TURNED SHARPLYAWAY SAYING IN A DESPERATE SORT OF TONEYOULL BE SORRY SOME DAY JO
OH WHERE ARE YOU GOING
 SHE CRIED FOR HIS FACE FRIGHTENED HER
TO THE DEVIL
 WAS THE CONSOLING ANSWER
FOR A MINUTE JOS HEART STOOD STILL AS HE SWUNG HIMSELF DOWN THE BANKTOWARD THE RIVER BUT IT TAKES MUCH FOLLY SIN OR MISERY TO SEND AYOUNG MAN TO A VIOLENT DEATH AND LAURIE WAS NOT ONE OF THE WEAK SORTWHO ARE CONQUERED BY A SINGLE FAILURE
 HE HAD NO THOUGHT OF AMELODRAMATIC PLUNGE BUT SOME BLIND INSTINCT LED HIM TO FLING HAT ANDCOAT INTO HIS BOAT AND ROW AWAY WITH ALL HIS MIGHT MAKING BETTER TIMEUP THE RIVER THAN HE HAD DONE IN MANY A RACE
 JO DREW A LONG BREATH ANDUNCLASPED HER HANDS AS SHE WATCHED THE POOR FELLOW TRYING TO OUTSTRIPTHE TROUBLE WHICH HE CARRIED IN HIS HEART
THAT WILL DO HIM GOOD AND HELL COME HOME IN SUCH A TENDER PENITENTSTATE OF MIND THAT I SHANT DARE TO SEE HIM SHE SAID ADDING AS SHEWENT SLOWLY HOME FEELING AS IF SHE HAD MURDERED SOME INNOCENT THINGAND BURIED IT UNDER THE LEAVESNOW I MUST GO AND PREPARE MR
 LAURENCE TO BE VERY KIND TO MY POOR BOY
I WISH HED LOVE BETH PERHAPS HE MAY IN TIME BUT I BEGIN TO THINK IWAS MISTAKEN ABOUT HER
 OH DEAR
 HOW CAN GIRLS LIKE TO HAVE LOVERS ANDREFUSE THEM
 I THINK ITS DREADFUL
BEING SURE THAT NO ONE COULD DO IT SO WELL AS HERSELF SHE WENT STRAIGHTTO MR
 LAURENCE TOLD THE HARD STORY BRAVELY THROUGH AND THEN BROKEDOWN CRYING SO DISMALLY OVER HER OWN INSENSIBILITY THAT THE KIND OLDGENTLEMAN THOUGH SORELY DISAPPOINTED DID NOT UTTER A REPROACH
 HEFOUND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW ANY GIRL COULD HELP LOVING LAURIEAND HOPED SHE WOULD CHANGE HER MIND BUT HE KNEW EVEN BETTER THAN JOTHAT LOVE CANNOT BE FORCED SO HE SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY AND RESOLVED TOCARRY HIS BOY OUT OF HARMS WAY FOR YOUNG IMPETUOSITYS PARTING WORDSTO JO DISTURBED HIM MORE THAN HE WOULD CONFESS
WHEN LAURIE CAME HOME DEAD TIRED BUT QUITE COMPOSED HIS GRANDFATHERMET HIM AS IF HE KNEW NOTHING AND KEPT UP THE DELUSION VERYSUCCESSFULLY FOR AN HOUR OR TWO
 BUT WHEN THEY SAT TOGETHER IN THETWILIGHT THE TIME THEY USED TO ENJOY SO MUCH IT WAS HARD WORK FOR THEOLD MAN TO RAMBLE ON AS USUAL AND HARDER STILL FOR THE YOUNG ONE TOLISTEN TO PRAISES OF THE LAST YEARS SUCCESS WHICH TO HIM NOW SEEMEDLOVES LABOR LOST
 HE BORE IT AS LONG AS HE COULD THEN WENT TO HISPIANO AND BEGAN TO PLAY
 THE WINDOWS WERE OPEN AND JO WALKING IN THEGARDEN WITH BETH FOR ONCE UNDERSTOOD MUSIC BETTER THAN HER SISTER FORHE PLAYED THE SONATA PATHÉTIQUE AND PLAYED IT AS HE NEVER DID BEFORE
THATS VERY FINE I DARE SAY BUT ITS SAD ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE CRY GIVEUS SOMETHING GAYER LAD SAID MR
 LAURENCE WHOSE KIND OLD HEART WASFULL OF SYMPATHY WHICH HE LONGED TO SHOW BUT KNEW NOT HOW
LAURIE DASHED INTO A LIVELIER STRAIN PLAYED STORMILY FOR SEVERALMINUTES AND WOULD HAVE GOT THROUGH BRAVELY IF IN A MOMENTARY LULLMRS
 MARCHS VOICE HAD NOT BEEN HEARD CALLINGJO DEAR COME IN I WANT YOU
JUST WHAT LAURIE LONGED TO SAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEANING
 AS HELISTENED HE LOST HIS PLACE THE MUSIC ENDED WITH A BROKEN CHORD ANDTHE MUSICIAN SAT SILENT IN THE DARK
I CANT STAND THIS MUTTERED THE OLD GENTLEMAN
 UP HE GOT GROPED HISWAY TO THE PIANO LAID A KIND HAND ON EITHER OF THE BROAD SHOULDERS ANDSAID AS GENTLY AS A WOMANI KNOW MY BOY I KNOW
NO ANSWER FOR AN INSTANT THEN LAURIE ASKED SHARPLYWHO TOLD YOU
JO HERSELF
THEN THERES AN END OF IT
 AND HE SHOOK OFF HIS GRANDFATHERS HANDSWITH AN IMPATIENT MOTION FOR THOUGH GRATEFUL FOR THE SYMPATHY HISMANS PRIDE COULD NOT BEAR A MANS PITY
NOT QUITE I WANT TO SAY ONE THING AND THEN THERE SHALL BE AN END OFIT RETURNED MR
 LAURENCE WITH UNUSUAL MILDNESS
 YOU WONT CARE TOSTAY AT HOME JUST NOW PERHAPS
I DONT INTEND TO RUN AWAY FROM A GIRL
 JO CANT PREVENT MY SEEING HERAND I SHALL STAY AND DO IT AS LONG AS I LIKE INTERRUPTED LAURIE IN ADEFIANT TONE

 LAURENCE KEEPING HOLD OF THE YOUNG MAN AS IFFEARFUL THAT HE WOULD BREAK AWAY AS HIS FATHER HAD DONE BEFORE HIM

 AND LAURIE SAT DOWN WITHOUT A SIGN OF INTERESTIN FACE OR VOICE
THERE IS BUSINESS IN LONDON THAT NEEDS LOOKING AFTER I MEANT YOUSHOULD ATTEND TO IT BUT I CAN DO IT BETTER MYSELF AND THINGS HERE WILLGET ON VERY WELL WITH BROOKE TO MANAGE THEM
 MY PARTNERS DO ALMOSTEVERYTHING IM MERELY HOLDING ON TILL YOU TAKE MY PLACE AND CAN BE OFFAT ANY TIME
BUT YOU HATE TRAVELLING SIR I CANT ASK IT OF YOU AT YOUR AGE BEGANLAURIE WHO WAS GRATEFUL FOR THE SACRIFICE BUT MUCH PREFERRED TO GOALONE IF HE WENT AT ALL
THE OLD GENTLEMAN KNEW THAT PERFECTLY WELL AND PARTICULARLY DESIRED TOPREVENT IT FOR THE MOOD IN WHICH HE FOUND HIS GRANDSON ASSURED HIM THATIT WOULD NOT BE WISE TO LEAVE HIM TO HIS OWN DEVICES
 SO STIFLING ANATURAL REGRET AT THE THOUGHT OF THE HOME COMFORTS HE WOULD LEAVE BEHINDHIM HE SAID STOUTLYBLESS YOUR SOUL IM NOT SUPERANNUATED YET
 I QUITE ENJOY THE IDEA ITWILL DO ME GOOD AND MY OLD BONES WONT SUFFER FOR TRAVELLING NOWADAYSIS ALMOST AS EASY AS SITTING IN A CHAIR
A RESTLESS MOVEMENT FROM LAURIE SUGGESTED THAT HIS CHAIR WAS NOT EASYOR THAT HE DID NOT LIKE THE PLAN AND MADE THE OLD MAN ADD HASTILYI DONT MEAN TO BE A MARPLOT OR A BURDEN I GO BECAUSE I THINK YOUDFEEL HAPPIER THAN IF I WAS LEFT BEHIND
 I DONT INTEND TO GAD ABOUT WITHYOU BUT LEAVE YOU FREE TO GO WHERE YOU LIKE WHILE I AMUSE MYSELF IN MYOWN WAY

NOW LAURIE FELT JUST THEN THAT HIS HEART WAS ENTIRELY BROKEN AND THEWORLD A HOWLING WILDERNESS BUT AT THE SOUND OF CERTAIN WORDS WHICH THEOLD GENTLEMAN ARTFULLY INTRODUCED INTO HIS CLOSING SENTENCE THE BROKENHEART GAVE AN UNEXPECTED LEAP AND A GREEN OASIS OR TWO SUDDENLYAPPEARED IN THE HOWLING WILDERNESS
 HE SIGHED AND THEN SAID IN ASPIRITLESS TONEJUST AS YOU LIKE SIR IT DOESNT MATTER WHERE I GO OR WHAT I DO
IT DOES TO ME REMEMBER THAT MY LAD I GIVE YOU ENTIRE LIBERTY BUT ITRUST YOU TO MAKE AN HONEST USE OF IT
 PROMISE ME THAT LAURIE
ANYTHING YOU LIKE SIR
GOOD THOUGHT THE OLD GENTLEMAN
 YOU DONT CARE NOW BUT THERELLCOME A TIME WHEN THAT PROMISE WILL KEEP YOU OUT OF MISCHIEF OR IM MUCHMISTAKEN
BEING AN ENERGETIC INDIVIDUAL MR
 LAURENCE STRUCK WHILE THE IRON WASHOT AND BEFORE THE BLIGHTED BEING RECOVERED SPIRIT ENOUGH TO REBELTHEY WERE OFF
 DURING THE TIME NECESSARY FOR PREPARATION LAURIE BOREHIMSELF AS YOUNG GENTLEMEN USUALLY DO IN SUCH CASES
 HE WAS MOODYIRRITABLE AND PENSIVE BY TURNS LOST HIS APPETITE NEGLECTED HIS DRESSAND DEVOTED MUCH TIME TO PLAYING TEMPESTUOUSLY ON HIS PIANO AVOIDED JOBUT CONSOLED HIMSELF BY STARING AT HER FROM HIS WINDOW WITH A TRAGICALFACE THAT HAUNTED HER DREAMS BY NIGHT AND OPPRESSED HER WITH A HEAVYSENSE OF GUILT BY DAY
 UNLIKE SOME SUFFERERS HE NEVER SPOKE OF HISUNREQUITED PASSION AND WOULD ALLOW NO ONE NOT EVEN MRS
 MARCH TOATTEMPT CONSOLATION OR OFFER SYMPATHY
 ON SOME ACCOUNTS THIS WAS ARELIEF TO HIS FRIENDS BUT THE WEEKS BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE WERE VERYUNCOMFORTABLE AND EVERY ONE REJOICED THAT THE POOR DEAR FELLOW WASGOING AWAY TO FORGET HIS TROUBLE AND COME HOME HAPPY
 OF COURSE HESMILED DARKLY AT THEIR DELUSION BUT PASSED IT BY WITH THE SADSUPERIORITY OF ONE WHO KNEW THAT HIS FIDELITY LIKE HIS LOVE WASUNALTERABLE
WHEN THE PARTING CAME HE AFFECTED HIGH SPIRITS TO CONCEAL CERTAININCONVENIENT EMOTIONS WHICH SEEMED INCLINED TO ASSERT THEMSELVES
 THISGAYETY DID NOT IMPOSE UPON ANYBODY BUT THEY TRIED TO LOOK AS IF IT DIDFOR HIS SAKE AND HE GOT ON VERY WELL TILL MRS
 MARCH KISSED HIM WITHA WHISPER FULL OF MOTHERLY SOLICITUDE THEN FEELING THAT HE WAS GOINGVERY FAST HE HASTILY EMBRACED THEM ALL ROUND NOT FORGETTING THEAFFLICTED HANNAH AND RAN DOWNSTAIRS AS IF FOR HIS LIFE
 JO FOLLOWED AMINUTE AFTER TO WAVE HER HAND TO HIM IF HE LOOKED ROUND
 HE DID LOOKROUND CAME BACK PUT HIS ARMS ABOUT HER AS SHE STOOD ON THE STEP ABOVEHIM AND LOOKED UP AT HER WITH A FACE THAT MADE HIS SHORT APPEAL BOTHELOQUENT AND PATHETIC
O JO CANT YOU
                    ILLUSTRATION O JO CANT YOU
TEDDY DEAR I WISH I COULD
THAT WAS ALL EXCEPT A LITTLE PAUSE THEN LAURIE STRAIGHTENED HIMSELFUP SAID ITS ALL RIGHT NEVER MIND AND WENT AWAY WITHOUT ANOTHERWORD
 AH BUT IT WASNT ALL RIGHT AND JO DID MIND FOR WHILE THECURLY HEAD LAY ON HER ARM A MINUTE AFTER HER HARD ANSWER SHE FELT AS IFSHE HAD STABBED HER DEAREST FRIEND AND WHEN HE LEFT HER WITHOUT A LOOKBEHIND HIM SHE KNEW THAT THE BOY LAURIE NEVER WOULD COME AGAIN
                       ILLUSTRATION TAILPIECE                                 XXXVI
                             BETHS SECRET
WHEN JO CAME HOME THAT SPRING SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK WITH THE CHANGE INBETH
 NO ONE SPOKE OF IT OR SEEMED AWARE OF IT FOR IT HAD COME TOOGRADUALLY TO STARTLE THOSE WHO SAW HER DAILY BUT TO EYES SHARPENED BYABSENCE IT WAS VERY PLAIN AND A HEAVY WEIGHT FELL ON JOS HEART AS SHESAW HER SISTERS FACE
 IT WAS NO PALER AND BUT LITTLE THINNER THAN INTHE AUTUMN YET THERE WAS A STRANGE TRANSPARENT LOOK ABOUT IT AS IFTHE MORTAL WAS BEING SLOWLY REFINED AWAY AND THE IMMORTAL SHININGTHROUGH THE FRAIL FLESH WITH AN INDESCRIBABLY PATHETIC BEAUTY
 JO SAWAND FELT IT BUT SAID NOTHING AT THE TIME AND SOON THE FIRST IMPRESSIONLOST MUCH OF ITS POWER FOR BETH SEEMED HAPPY NO ONE APPEARED TO DOUBTTHAT SHE WAS BETTER AND PRESENTLY IN OTHER CARES JO FOR A TIMEFORGOT HER FEAR
BUT WHEN LAURIE WAS GONE AND PEACE PREVAILED AGAIN THE VAGUE ANXIETYRETURNED AND HAUNTED HER
 SHE HAD CONFESSED HER SINS AND BEEN FORGIVENBUT WHEN SHE SHOWED HER SAVINGS AND PROPOSED THE MOUNTAIN TRIP BETH HADTHANKED HER HEARTILY BUT BEGGED NOT TO GO SO FAR AWAY FROM HOME
ANOTHER LITTLE VISIT TO THE SEASHORE WOULD SUIT HER BETTER AND ASGRANDMA COULD NOT BE PREVAILED UPON TO LEAVE THE BABIES JO TOOK BETHDOWN TO THE QUIET PLACE WHERE SHE COULD LIVE MUCH IN THE OPEN AIR ANDLET THE FRESH SEABREEZES BLOW A LITTLE COLOR INTO HER PALE CHEEKS
IT WAS NOT A FASHIONABLE PLACE BUT EVEN AMONG THE PLEASANT PEOPLETHERE THE GIRLS MADE FEW FRIENDS PREFERRING TO LIVE FOR ONE ANOTHER
BETH WAS TOO SHY TO ENJOY SOCIETY AND JO TOO WRAPPED UP IN HER TO CAREFOR ANY ONE ELSE SO THEY WERE ALL IN ALL TO EACH OTHER AND CAME ANDWENT QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE INTEREST THEY EXCITED IN THOSE ABOUTTHEM WHO WATCHED WITH SYMPATHETIC EYES THE STRONG SISTER AND THE FEEBLEONE ALWAYS TOGETHER AS IF THEY FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT A LONGSEPARATION WAS NOT FAR AWAY
THEY DID FEEL IT YET NEITHER SPOKE OF IT FOR OFTEN BETWEEN OURSELVESAND THOSE NEAREST AND DEAREST TO US THERE EXISTS A RESERVE WHICH IT ISVERY HARD TO OVERCOME
 JO FELT AS IF A VEIL HAD FALLEN BETWEEN HER HEARTAND BETHS BUT WHEN SHE PUT OUT HER HAND TO LIFT IT UP THERE SEEMEDSOMETHING SACRED IN THE SILENCE AND SHE WAITED FOR BETH TO SPEAK
 SHEWONDERED AND WAS THANKFUL ALSO THAT HER PARENTS DID NOT SEEM TO SEEWHAT SHE SAW AND DURING THE QUIET WEEKS WHEN THE SHADOW GREW SO PLAINTO HER SHE SAID NOTHING OF IT TO THOSE AT HOME BELIEVING THAT IT WOULDTELL ITSELF WHEN BETH CAME BACK NO BETTER
 SHE WONDERED STILL MORE IFHER SISTER REALLY GUESSED THE HARD TRUTH AND WHAT THOUGHTS WERE PASSINGTHROUGH HER MIND DURING THE LONG HOURS WHEN SHE LAY ON THE WARM ROCKSWITH HER HEAD IN JOS LAP WHILE THE WINDS BLEW HEALTHFULLY OVER HERAND THE SEA MADE MUSIC AT HER FEET
     ILLUSTRATION WITH HER HEAD IN JOS LAP WHILE THE WIND BLEW                        HEALTHFULLY OVER HERONE DAY BETH TOLD HER
 JO THOUGHT SHE WAS ASLEEP SHE LAY SO STILL ANDPUTTING DOWN HER BOOK SAT LOOKING AT HER WITH WISTFUL EYES TRYING TOSEE SIGNS OF HOPE IN THE FAINT COLOR ON BETHS CHEEKS
 BUT SHE COULD NOTFIND ENOUGH TO SATISFY HER FOR THE CHEEKS WERE VERY THIN AND THE HANDSSEEMED TOO FEEBLE TO HOLD EVEN THE ROSY LITTLE SHELLS THEY HAD BEENGATHERING
 IT CAME TO HER THEN MORE BITTERLY THAN EVER THAT BETH WASSLOWLY DRIFTING AWAY FROM HER AND HER ARMS INSTINCTIVELY TIGHTENEDTHEIR HOLD UPON THE DEAREST TREASURE SHE POSSESSED
 FOR A MINUTE HEREYES WERE TOO DIM FOR SEEING AND WHEN THEY CLEARED BETH WAS LOOKINGUP AT HER SO TENDERLY THAT THERE WAS HARDLY ANY NEED FOR HER TO SAYJO DEAR IM GLAD YOU KNOW IT
 IVE TRIED TO TELL YOU BUT ICOULDNT
THERE WAS NO ANSWER EXCEPT HER SISTERS CHEEK AGAINST HER OWN NOT EVENTEARS FOR WHEN MOST DEEPLY MOVED JO DID NOT CRY
 SHE WAS THE WEAKERTHEN AND BETH TRIED TO COMFORT AND SUSTAIN HER WITH HER ARMS ABOUTHER AND THE SOOTHING WORDS SHE WHISPERED IN HER EAR

ALONG THIS WALK ON CHRISTMAS DAY A TALL YOUNG MAN WALKED SLOWLY WITHHIS HANDS BEHIND HIM AND A SOMEWHAT ABSENT EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE
HE LOOKED LIKE AN ITALIAN WAS DRESSED LIKE AN ENGLISHMAN AND HAD THEINDEPENDENT AIR OF AN AMERICANA COMBINATION WHICH CAUSED SUNDRY PAIRSOF FEMININE EYES TO LOOK APPROVINGLY AFTER HIM AND SUNDRY DANDIES INBLACK VELVET SUITS WITH ROSECOLORED NECKTIES BUFF GLOVES ANDORANGEFLOWERS IN THEIR BUTTONHOLES TO SHRUG THEIR SHOULDERS AND THENENVY HIM HIS INCHES
 THERE WERE PLENTY OF PRETTY FACES TO ADMIRE BUTTHE YOUNG MAN TOOK LITTLE NOTICE OF THEM EXCEPT TO GLANCE NOW ANDTHEN AT SOME BLONDE GIRL OR LADY IN BLUE
 PRESENTLY HE STROLLED OUT OFTHE PROMENADE AND STOOD A MOMENT AT THE CROSSING AS IF UNDECIDEDWHETHER TO GO AND LISTEN TO THE BAND IN THE JARDIN PUBLIQUE OR TOWANDER ALONG THE BEACH TOWARD CASTLE HILL
 THE QUICK TROT OF PONIESFEET MADE HIM LOOK UP AS ONE OF THE LITTLE CARRIAGES CONTAINING ASINGLE LADY CAME RAPIDLY DOWN THE STREET
 THE LADY WAS YOUNG BLONDEAND DRESSED IN BLUE
 HE STARED A MINUTE THEN HIS WHOLE FACE WOKE UPAND WAVING HIS HAT LIKE A BOY HE HURRIED FORWARD TO MEET HER

 I AM OFTEN WITH HIM AND HEENJOYS MY ADVENTURES WHILE I LIKE TO FEEL THAT SOME ONE IS GLAD TO SEEME WHEN I GET BACK FROM MY WANDERINGS
 DIRTY OLD HOLE ISNT IT
 HEADDED WITH A LOOK OF DISGUST AS THEY DROVE ALONG THE BOULEVARD TO THEPLACE NAPOLEON IN THE OLD CITY
THE DIRT IS PICTURESQUE SO I DONT MIND
 THE RIVER AND THE HILLS AREDELICIOUS AND THESE GLIMPSES OF THE NARROW CROSSSTREETS ARE MYDELIGHT
 NOW WE SHALL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THAT PROCESSION TO PASS ITSGOING TO THE CHURCH OF ST
 JOHN
WHILE LAURIE LISTLESSLY WATCHED THE PROCESSION OF PRIESTS UNDER THEIRCANOPIES WHITEVEILED NUNS BEARING LIGHTED TAPERS AND SOME BROTHERHOODIN BLUE CHANTING AS THEY WALKED AMY WATCHED HIM AND FELT A NEW SORTOF SHYNESS STEAL OVER HER FOR HE WAS CHANGED AND SHE COULD NOT FINDTHE MERRYFACED BOY SHE LEFT IN THE MOODYLOOKING MAN BESIDE HER
 HE WASHANDSOMER THAN EVER AND GREATLY IMPROVED SHE THOUGHT BUT NOW THAT THEFLUSH OF PLEASURE AT MEETING HER WAS OVER HE LOOKED TIRED ANDSPIRITLESSNOT SICK NOR EXACTLY UNHAPPY BUT OLDER AND GRAVER THAN AYEAR OR TWO OF PROSPEROUS LIFE SHOULD HAVE MADE HIM
 SHE COULDNTUNDERSTAND IT AND DID NOT VENTURE TO ASK QUESTIONS SO SHE SHOOK HERHEAD AND TOUCHED UP HER PONIES AS THE PROCESSION WOUND AWAY ACROSS THEARCHES OF THE PAGLIONI BRIDGE AND VANISHED IN THE CHURCH
QUE PENSEZ VOUS
 SHE SAID AIRING HER FRENCH WHICH HAD IMPROVED INQUANTITY IF NOT IN QUALITY SINCE SHE CAME ABROAD
THAT MADEMOISELLE HAS MADE GOOD USE OF HER TIME AND THE RESULT ISCHARMING REPLIED LAURIE BOWING WITH HIS HAND ON HIS HEART AND ANADMIRING LOOK
SHE BLUSHED WITH PLEASURE BUT SOMEHOW THE COMPLIMENT DID NOT SATISFYHER LIKE THE BLUNT PRAISES HE USED TO GIVE HER AT HOME WHEN HEPROMENADED ROUND HER ON FESTIVAL OCCASIONS AND TOLD HER SHE WASALTOGETHER JOLLY WITH A HEARTY SMILE AND AN APPROVING PAT ON THEHEAD
 SHE DIDNT LIKE THE NEW TONE FOR THOUGH NOT BLASÉ IT SOUNDEDINDIFFERENT IN SPITE OF THE LOOK
IF THATS THE WAY HES GOING TO GROW UP I WISH HED STAY A BOY SHETHOUGHT WITH A CURIOUS SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND DISCOMFORT TRYINGMEANTIME TO SEEM QUITE EASY AND GAY
AT AVIGDORS SHE FOUND THE PRECIOUS HOMELETTERS AND GIVING THE REINSTO LAURIE READ THEM LUXURIOUSLY AS THEY WOUND UP THE SHADY ROAD BETWEENGREEN HEDGES WHERE TEAROSES BLOOMED AS FRESHLY AS IN JUNE
BETH IS VERY POORLY MOTHER SAYS
 I OFTEN THINK I OUGHT TO GO HOME BUTTHEY ALL SAY STAY SO I DO FOR I SHALL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE LIKETHIS SAID AMY LOOKING SOBER OVER ONE PAGE
I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT THERE YOU COULD DO NOTHING AT HOME AND IT IS AGREAT COMFORT TO THEM TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE WELL AND HAPPY AND ENJOYINGSO MUCH MY DEAR
HE DREW A LITTLE NEARER AND LOOKED MORE LIKE HIS OLD SELF AS HE SAIDTHAT AND THE FEAR THAT SOMETIMES WEIGHED ON AMYS HEART WAS LIGHTENEDFOR THE LOOK THE ACT THE BROTHERLY MY DEAR SEEMED TO ASSURE HERTHAT IF ANY TROUBLE DID COME SHE WOULD NOT BE ALONE IN A STRANGE LAND
PRESENTLY SHE LAUGHED AND SHOWED HIM A SMALL SKETCH OF JO IN HERSCRIBBLINGSUIT WITH THE BOW RAMPANTLY ERECT UPON HER CAP AND ISSUINGFROM HER MOUTH THE WORDS GENIUS BURNS
LAURIE SMILED TOOK IT PUT IT IN HIS VESTPOCKET TO KEEP IT FROMBLOWING AWAY AND LISTENED WITH INTEREST TO THE LIVELY LETTER AMY READHIM
THIS WILL BE A REGULARLY MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ME WITH PRESENTS IN THEMORNING YOU AND LETTERS IN THE AFTERNOON AND A PARTY AT NIGHT SAIDAMY AS THEY ALIGHTED AMONG THE RUINS OF THE OLD FORT AND A FLOCK OFSPLENDID PEACOCKS CAME TROOPING ABOUT THEM TAMELY WAITING TO BE FED
WHILE AMY STOOD LAUGHING ON THE BANK ABOVE HIM AS SHE SCATTERED CRUMBSTO THE BRILLIANT BIRDS LAURIE LOOKED AT HER AS SHE HAD LOOKED AT HIMWITH A NATURAL CURIOSITY TO SEE WHAT CHANGES TIME AND ABSENCE HADWROUGHT
 HE FOUND NOTHING TO PERPLEX OR DISAPPOINT MUCH TO ADMIRE ANDAPPROVE FOR OVERLOOKING A FEW LITTLE AFFECTATIONS OF SPEECH ANDMANNER SHE WAS AS SPRIGHTLY AND GRACEFUL AS EVER WITH THE ADDITION OFTHAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING IN DRESS AND BEARING WHICH WE CALLELEGANCE
 ALWAYS MATURE FOR HER AGE SHE HAD GAINED A CERTAIN APLOMBIN BOTH CARRIAGE AND CONVERSATION WHICH MADE HER SEEM MORE OF A WOMANOF THE WORLD THAN SHE WAS BUT HER OLD PETULANCE NOW AND THEN SHOWEDITSELF HER STRONG WILL STILL HELD ITS OWN AND HER NATIVE FRANKNESS WASUNSPOILED BY FOREIGN POLISH
LAURIE DID NOT READ ALL THIS WHILE HE WATCHED HER FEED THE PEACOCKS BUTHE SAW ENOUGH TO SATISFY AND INTEREST HIM AND CARRIED AWAY A PRETTYLITTLE PICTURE OF A BRIGHTFACED GIRL STANDING IN THE SUNSHINE WHICHBROUGHT OUT THE SOFT HUE OF HER DRESS THE FRESH COLOR OF HER CHEEKSTHE GOLDEN GLOSS OF HER HAIR AND MADE HER A PROMINENT FIGURE IN THEPLEASANT SCENE
AS THEY CAME UP ON TO THE STONE PLATEAU THAT CROWNS THE HILL AMY WAVEDHER HAND AS IF WELCOMING HIM TO HER FAVORITE HAUNT AND SAID POINTINGHERE AND THEREDO YOU REMEMBER THE CATHEDRAL AND THE CORSO THE FISHERMEN DRAGGINGTHEIR NETS IN THE BAY AND THE LOVELY ROAD TO VILLA FRANCA SCHUBERTSTOWER JUST BELOW AND BEST OF ALL THAT SPECK FAR OUT TO SEA WHICHTHEY SAY IS CORSICA
I REMEMBER ITS NOT MUCH CHANGED HE ANSWERED WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM
WHAT JO WOULD GIVE FOR A SIGHT OF THAT FAMOUS SPECK
 SAID AMY FEELINGIN GOOD SPIRITS AND ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM SO ALSO
YES WAS ALL HE SAID BUT HE TURNED AND STRAINED HIS EYES TO SEE THEISLAND WHICH A GREATER USURPER THAN EVEN NAPOLEON NOW MADE INTERESTINGIN HIS SIGHT
TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT IT FOR HER SAKE AND THEN COME AND TELL ME WHAT YOUHAVE BEEN DOING WITH YOURSELF ALL THIS WHILE SAID AMY SEATINGHERSELF READY FOR A GOOD TALK
BUT SHE DID NOT GET IT FOR THOUGH HE JOINED HER AND ANSWERED ALL HERQUESTIONS FREELY SHE COULD ONLY LEARN THAT HE HAD ROVED ABOUT THECONTINENT AND BEEN TO GREECE
 SO AFTER IDLING AWAY AN HOUR THEY DROVEHOME AGAIN AND HAVING PAID HIS RESPECTS TO MRS
 CARROL LAURIE LEFTTHEM PROMISING TO RETURN IN THE EVENING
IT MUST BE RECORDED OF AMY THAT SHE DELIBERATELY PRINKED THAT NIGHT
TIME AND ABSENCE HAD DONE ITS WORK ON BOTH THE YOUNG PEOPLE SHE HADSEEN HER OLD FRIEND IN A NEW LIGHT NOT AS OUR BOY BUT AS A HANDSOMEAND AGREEABLE MAN AND SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A VERY NATURAL DESIRE TOFIND FAVOR IN HIS SIGHT
 AMY KNEW HER GOOD POINTS AND MADE THE MOST OFTHEM WITH THE TASTE AND SKILL WHICH IS A FORTUNE TO A POOR AND PRETTYWOMAN
TARLATAN AND TULLE WERE CHEAP AT NICE SO SHE ENVELOPED HERSELF IN THEMON SUCH OCCASIONS AND FOLLOWING THE SENSIBLE ENGLISH FASHION OF SIMPLEDRESS FOR YOUNG GIRLS GOT UP CHARMING LITTLE TOILETTES WITH FRESHFLOWERS A FEW TRINKETS AND ALL MANNER OF DAINTY DEVICES WHICH WEREBOTH INEXPENSIVE AND EFFECTIVE
 IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT THE ARTISTSOMETIMES GOT POSSESSION OF THE WOMAN AND INDULGED IN ANTIQUECOIFFURES STATUESQUE ATTITUDES AND CLASSIC DRAPERIES
 BUT DEARHEART WE ALL HAVE OUR LITTLE WEAKNESSES AND FIND IT EASY TO PARDONSUCH IN THE YOUNG WHO SATISFY OUR EYES WITH THEIR COMELINESS AND KEEPOUR HEARTS MERRY WITH THEIR ARTLESS VANITIES
I DO WANT HIM TO THINK I LOOK WELL AND TELL THEM SO AT HOME SAID AMYTO HERSELF AS SHE PUT ON FLOS OLD WHITE SILK BALLDRESS AND COVEREDIT WITH A CLOUD OF FRESH ILLUSION OUT OF WHICH HER WHITE SHOULDERS ANDGOLDEN HEAD EMERGED WITH A MOST ARTISTIC EFFECT
 HER HAIR SHE HAD THESENSE TO LET ALONE AFTER GATHERING UP THE THICK WAVES AND CURLS INTO AHEBELIKE KNOT AT THE BACK OF HER HEAD
ITS NOT THE FASHION BUT ITS BECOMING AND I CANT AFFORD TO MAKE AFRIGHT OF MYSELF SHE USED TO SAY WHEN ADVISED TO FRIZZLE PUFF ORBRAID AS THE LATEST STYLE COMMANDED
HAVING NO ORNAMENTS FINE ENOUGH FOR THIS IMPORTANT OCCASION AMY LOOPEDHER FLEECY SKIRTS WITH ROSY CLUSTERS OF AZALEA AND FRAMED THE WHITESHOULDERS IN DELICATE GREEN VINES
 REMEMBERING THE PAINTED BOOTS SHESURVEYED HER WHITE SATIN SLIPPERS WITH GIRLISH SATISFACTION ANDCHASSÉED DOWN THE ROOM ADMIRING HER ARISTOCRATIC FEET ALL BY HERSELF
MY NEW FAN JUST MATCHES MY FLOWERS MY GLOVES FIT TO A CHARM AND THEREAL LACE ON AUNTS MOUCHOIR GIVES AN AIR TO MY WHOLE DRESS
 IF I ONLYHAD A CLASSICAL NOSE AND MOUTH I SHOULD BE PERFECTLY HAPPY SHE SAIDSURVEYING HERSELF WITH A CRITICAL EYE AND A CANDLE IN EACH HAND
IN SPITE OF THIS AFFLICTION SHE LOOKED UNUSUALLY GAY AND GRACEFUL ASSHE GLIDED AWAY SHE SELDOM RANIT DID NOT SUIT HER STYLE SHETHOUGHT FOR BEING TALL THE STATELY AND JUNOESQUE WAS MORE APPROPRIATETHAN THE SPORTIVE OR PIQUANTE
 SHE WALKED UP AND DOWN THE LONG SALOONWHILE WAITING FOR LAURIE AND ONCE ARRANGED HERSELF UNDER THECHANDELIER WHICH HAD A GOOD EFFECT UPON HER HAIR THEN SHE THOUGHTBETTER OF IT AND WENT AWAY TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM AS IF ASHAMEDOF THE GIRLISH DESIRE TO HAVE THE FIRST VIEW A PROPITIOUS ONE
 IT SOHAPPENED THAT SHE COULD NOT HAVE DONE A BETTER THING FOR LAURIE CAME INSO QUIETLY SHE DID NOT HEAR HIM AND AS SHE STOOD AT THE DISTANTWINDOW WITH HER HEAD HALF TURNED AND ONE HAND GATHERING UP HER DRESSTHE SLENDER WHITE FIGURE AGAINST THE RED CURTAINS WAS AS EFFECTIVE AS AWELLPLACED STATUE
GOOD EVENING DIANA
 SAID LAURIE WITH THE LOOK OF SATISFACTION SHELIKED TO SEE IN HIS EYES WHEN THEY RESTED ON HER
GOOD EVENING APOLLO
 SHE ANSWERED SMILING BACK AT HIM FOR HE TOOLOOKED UNUSUALLY DEBONNAIRE AND THE THOUGHT OF ENTERING THE BALLROOMON THE ARM OF SUCH A PERSONABLE MAN CAUSED AMY TO PITY THE FOUR PLAINMISSES DAVIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF HER HEART
HERE ARE YOUR FLOWERS I ARRANGED THEM MYSELF REMEMBERING THAT YOUDIDNT LIKE WHAT HANNAH CALLS A SOTBOOKAY SAID LAURIE HANDING HERA DELICATE NOSEGAY IN A HOLDER THAT SHE HAD LONG COVETED AS SHE DAILYPASSED IT IN CARDIGLIAS WINDOW
                  ILLUSTRATION HERE ARE YOUR FLOWERSHOW KIND YOU ARE
 SHE EXCLAIMED GRATEFULLY
 IF ID KNOWN YOU WERECOMING ID HAVE HAD SOMETHING READY FOR YOU TODAY THOUGH NOT AS PRETTYAS THIS IM AFRAID
THANK YOU IT ISNT WHAT IT SHOULD BE BUT YOU HAVE IMPROVED IT HEADDED AS SHE SNAPPED THE SILVER BRACELET ON HER WRIST
PLEASE DONT
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED THAT SORT OF THING
NOT FROM YOU IT DOESNT SOUND NATURAL AND I LIKE YOUR OLD BLUNTNESSBETTER
IM GLAD OF IT HE ANSWERED WITH A LOOK OF RELIEF THEN BUTTONED HERGLOVES FOR HER AND ASKED IF HIS TIE WAS STRAIGHT JUST AS HE USED TO DOWHEN THEY WENT TO PARTIES TOGETHER AT HOME
THE COMPANY ASSEMBLED IN THE LONG SALLE À MANGER THAT EVENING WASSUCH AS ONE SEES NOWHERE BUT ON THE CONTINENT
 THE HOSPITABLE AMERICANSHAD INVITED EVERY ACQUAINTANCE THEY HAD IN NICE AND HAVING NOPREJUDICE AGAINST TITLES SECURED A FEW TO ADD LUSTRE TO THEIR CHRISTMASBALL
A RUSSIAN PRINCE CONDESCENDED TO SIT IN A CORNER FOR AN HOUR AND TALKWITH A MASSIVE LADY DRESSED LIKE HAMLETS MOTHER IN BLACK VELVET WITHA PEARL BRIDLE UNDER HER CHIN
 A POLISH COUNT AGED EIGHTEEN DEVOTEDHIMSELF TO THE LADIES WHO PRONOUNCED HIM A FASCINATING DEAR AND AGERMAN SERENE SOMETHING HAVING COME FOR THE SUPPER ALONE ROAMEDVAGUELY ABOUT SEEKING WHAT HE MIGHT DEVOUR
 BARON ROTHSCHILDS PRIVATESECRETARY A LARGENOSED JEW IN TIGHT BOOTS AFFABLY BEAMED UPON THEWORLD AS IF HIS MASTERS NAME CROWNED HIM WITH A GOLDEN HALO A STOUTFRENCHMAN WHO KNEW THE EMPEROR CAME TO INDULGE HIS MANIA FOR DANCINGAND LADY DE JONES A BRITISH MATRON ADORNED THE SCENE WITH HER LITTLEFAMILY OF EIGHT
 OF COURSE THERE WERE MANY LIGHTFOOTED SHRILLVOICEDAMERICAN GIRLS HANDSOME LIFELESSLOOKING ENGLISH DITTO AND A FEWPLAIN BUT PIQUANTE FRENCH DEMOISELLES LIKEWISE THE USUAL SET OFTRAVELLING YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHO DISPORTED THEMSELVES GAYLY WHILE MAMMASOF ALL NATIONS LINED THE WALLS AND SMILED UPON THEM BENIGNLY WHEN THEYDANCED WITH THEIR DAUGHTERS
ANY YOUNG GIRL CAN IMAGINE AMYS STATE OF MIND WHEN SHE TOOK THE STAGETHAT NIGHT LEANING ON LAURIES ARM
 SHE KNEW SHE LOOKED WELL SHE LOVEDTO DANCE SHE FELT THAT HER FOOT WAS ON HER NATIVE HEATH IN A BALLROOMAND ENJOYED THE DELIGHTFUL SENSE OF POWER WHICH COMES WHEN YOUNG GIRLSFIRST DISCOVER THE NEW AND LOVELY KINGDOM THEY ARE BORN TO RULE BYVIRTUE OF BEAUTY YOUTH AND WOMANHOOD
 SHE DID PITY THE DAVIS GIRLSWHO WERE AWKWARD PLAIN AND DESTITUTE OF ESCORT EXCEPT A GRIM PAPA ANDTHREE GRIMMER MAIDEN AUNTS AND SHE BOWED TO THEM IN HER FRIENDLIESTMANNER AS SHE PASSED WHICH WAS GOOD OF HER AS IT PERMITTED THEM TO SEEHER DRESS AND BURN WITH CURIOSITY TO KNOW WHO HER DISTINGUISHEDLOOKINGFRIEND MIGHT BE
 WITH THE FIRST BURST OF THE BAND AMYS COLOR ROSE HEREYES BEGAN TO SPARKLE AND HER FEET TO TAP THE FLOOR IMPATIENTLY FORSHE DANCED WELL AND WANTED LAURIE TO KNOW IT THEREFORE THE SHOCK SHERECEIVED CAN BETTER BE IMAGINED THAN DESCRIBED WHEN HE SAID IN APERFECTLY TRANQUIL TONEDO YOU CARE TO DANCE
ONE USUALLY DOES AT A BALL
HER AMAZED LOOK AND QUICK ANSWER CAUSED LAURIE TO REPAIR HIS ERROR ASFAST AS POSSIBLE
I MEANT THE FIRST DANCE
 MAY I HAVE THE HONOR
I CAN GIVE YOU ONE IF I PUT OFF THE COUNT
 HE DANCES DIVINELY BUT HEWILL EXCUSE ME AS YOU ARE AN OLD FRIEND SAID AMY HOPING THAT THENAME WOULD HAVE A GOOD EFFECT AND SHOW LAURIE THAT SHE WAS NOT TO BETRIFLED WITH
NICE LITTLE BOY BUT RATHER A SHORT POLE TO SUPPORT        A DAUGHTER OF THE GODS          DIVINELY TALL AND MOST DIVINELY FAIRWAS ALL THE SATISFACTION SHE GOT HOWEVER
THE SET IN WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES WAS COMPOSED OF ENGLISH AND AMYWAS COMPELLED TO WALK DECOROUSLY THROUGH A COTILLON FEELING ALL THEWHILE AS IF SHE COULD DANCE THE TARANTULA WITH A RELISH
 LAURIE RESIGNEDHER TO THE NICE LITTLE BOY AND WENT TO DO HIS DUTY TO FLO WITHOUTSECURING AMY FOR THE JOYS TO COME WHICH REPREHENSIBLE WANT OFFORETHOUGHT WAS PROPERLY PUNISHED FOR SHE IMMEDIATELY ENGAGED HERSELFTILL SUPPER MEANING TO RELENT IF HE THEN GAVE ANY SIGNS OF PENITENCE
SHE SHOWED HIM HER BALLBOOK WITH DEMURE SATISFACTION WHEN HE STROLLEDINSTEAD OF RUSHING UP TO CLAIM HER FOR THE NEXT A GLORIOUSPOLKAREDOWA BUT HIS POLITE REGRETS DIDNT IMPOSE UPON HER AND WHENSHE GALLOPADED AWAY WITH THE COUNT SHE SAW LAURIE SIT DOWN BY HER AUNTWITH AN ACTUAL EXPRESSION OF RELIEF
THAT WAS UNPARDONABLE AND AMY TOOK NO MORE NOTICE OF HIM FOR A LONGWHILE EXCEPT A WORD NOW AND THEN WHEN SHE CAME TO HER CHAPERONBETWEEN THE DANCES FOR A NECESSARY PIN OR A MOMENTS REST
 HER ANGERHAD A GOOD EFFECT HOWEVER FOR SHE HID IT UNDER A SMILING FACE ANDSEEMED UNUSUALLY BLITHE AND BRILLIANT
 LAURIES EYES FOLLOWED HER WITHPLEASURE FOR SHE NEITHER ROMPED NOR SAUNTERED BUT DANCED WITH SPIRITAND GRACE MAKING THE DELIGHTSOME PASTIME WHAT IT SHOULD BE
 HE VERYNATURALLY FELL TO STUDYING HER FROM THIS NEW POINT OF VIEW AND BEFORETHE EVENING WAS HALF OVER HAD DECIDED THAT LITTLE AMY WAS GOING TOMAKE A VERY CHARMING WOMAN
IT WAS A LIVELY SCENE FOR SOON THE SPIRIT OF THE SOCIAL SEASON TOOKPOSSESSION OF EVERY ONE AND CHRISTMAS MERRIMENT MADE ALL FACES SHINEHEARTS HAPPY AND HEELS LIGHT
 THE MUSICIANS FIDDLED TOOTED AND BANGEDAS IF THEY ENJOYED IT EVERYBODY DANCED WHO COULD AND THOSE WHOCOULDNT ADMIRED THEIR NEIGHBORS WITH UNCOMMON WARMTH
 THE AIR WAS DARKWITH DAVISES AND MANY JONESES GAMBOLLED LIKE A FLOCK OF YOUNG GIRAFFES
THE GOLDEN SECRETARY DARTED THROUGH THE ROOM LIKE A METEOR WITH ADASHING FRENCHWOMAN WHO CARPETED THE FLOOR WITH HER PINK SATIN TRAIN
THE SERENE TEUTON FOUND THE SUPPERTABLE AND WAS HAPPY EATING STEADILYTHROUGH THE BILL OF FARE AND DISMAYED THE GARÇONS BY THE RAVAGES HECOMMITTED
 BUT THE EMPERORS FRIEND COVERED HIMSELF WITH GLORY FOR HEDANCED EVERYTHING WHETHER HE KNEW IT OR NOT AND INTRODUCED IMPROMPTUPIROUETTES WHEN THE FIGURES BEWILDERED HIM
 THE BOYISH ABANDON OF THATSTOUT MAN WAS CHARMING TO BEHOLD FOR THOUGH HE CARRIED WEIGHT HEDANCED LIKE AN INDIARUBBER BALL
 HE RAN HE FLEW HE PRANCED HIS FACEGLOWED HIS BALD HEAD SHONE HIS COATTAILS WAVED WILDLY HIS PUMPSACTUALLY TWINKLED IN THE AIR AND WHEN THE MUSIC STOPPED HE WIPED THEDROPS FROM HIS BROW AND BEAMED UPON HIS FELLOWMEN LIKE A FRENCHPICKWICK WITHOUT GLASSES
AMY AND HER POLE DISTINGUISHED THEMSELVES BY EQUAL ENTHUSIASM BUT MOREGRACEFUL AGILITY AND LAURIE FOUND HIMSELF INVOLUNTARILY KEEPING TIME TOTHE RHYTHMIC RISE AND FALL OF THE WHITE SLIPPERS AS THEY FLEW BY ASINDEFATIGABLY AS IF WINGED
 WHEN LITTLE VLADIMIR FINALLY RELINQUISHEDHER WITH ASSURANCES THAT HE WAS DESOLATED TO LEAVE SO EARLY SHE WASREADY TO REST AND SEE HOW HER RECREANT KNIGHT HAD BORNE HIS PUNISHMENT
IT HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL FOR AT THREEANDTWENTY BLIGHTED AFFECTIONSFIND A BALM IN FRIENDLY SOCIETY AND YOUNG NERVES WILL THRILL YOUNGBLOOD DANCE AND HEALTHY YOUNG SPIRITS RISE WHEN SUBJECTED TO THEENCHANTMENT OF BEAUTY LIGHT MUSIC AND MOTION
 LAURIE HAD A WAKEDUPLOOK AS HE ROSE TO GIVE HER HIS SEAT AND WHEN HE HURRIED AWAY TO BRINGHER SOME SUPPER SHE SAID TO HERSELF WITH A SATISFIED SMILEAH I THOUGHT THAT WOULD DO HIM GOOD
YOU LOOK LIKE BALZACS FEMME PEINTE PAR ELLEMÊME HE SAID AS HEFANNED HER WITH ONE HAND AND HELD HER COFFEECUP IN THE OTHER
MY ROUGE WONT COME OFF AND AMY RUBBED HER BRILLIANT CHEEK ANDSHOWED HIM HER WHITE GLOVE WITH A SOBER SIMPLICITY THAT MADE HIM LAUGHOUTRIGHT
WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS STUFF
 HE ASKED TOUCHING A FOLD OF HER DRESSTHAT HAD BLOWN OVER HIS KNEE
ILLUSION
GOOD NAME FOR IT ITS VERY PRETTYNEW THING ISNT IT
ITS AS OLD AS THE HILLS YOU HAVE SEEN IT ON DOZENS OF GIRLS AND YOUNEVER FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS PRETTY TILL NOWSTUPIDE
I NEVER SAW IT ON YOU BEFORE WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THE MISTAKE YOU SEE
NONE OF THAT IT IS FORBIDDEN ID RATHER TAKE COFFEE THAN COMPLIMENTSJUST NOW
 NO DONT LOUNGE IT MAKES ME NERVOUS
LAURIE SAT BOLT UPRIGHT AND MEEKLY TOOK HER EMPTY PLATE FEELING AN ODDSORT OF PLEASURE IN HAVING LITTLE AMY ORDER HIM ABOUT FOR SHE HADLOST HER SHYNESS NOW AND FELT AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE TO TRAMPLE ON HIMAS GIRLS HAVE A DELIGHTFUL WAY OF DOING WHEN LORDS OF CREATION SHOW ANYSIGNS OF SUBJECTION
WHERE DID YOU LEARN ALL THIS SORT OF THING
 HE ASKED WITH A QUIZZICALLOOK
AS THIS SORT OF THING IS RATHER A VAGUE EXPRESSION WOULD YOU KINDLYEXPLAIN
 RETURNED AMY KNOWING PERFECTLY WELL WHAT HE MEANT BUTWICKEDLY LEAVING HIM TO DESCRIBE WHAT IS INDESCRIBABLE

AMY RATHER REGRETTED THAT LAST SENTENCE FEARING IT WASNT IN GOODTASTE BUT LAURIE LIKED HER THE BETTER FOR IT AND FOUND HIMSELF BOTHADMIRING AND RESPECTING THE BRAVE PATIENCE THAT MADE THE MOST OFOPPORTUNITY AND THE CHEERFUL SPIRIT THAT COVERED POVERTY WITH FLOWERS
AMY DID NOT KNOW WHY HE LOOKED AT HER SO KINDLY NOR WHY HE FILLED UPHER BOOK WITH HIS OWN NAME AND DEVOTED HIMSELF TO HER FOR THE REST OFTHE EVENING IN THE MOST DELIGHTFUL MANNER BUT THE IMPULSE THAT WROUGHTTHIS AGREEABLE CHANGE WAS THE RESULT OF ONE OF THE NEW IMPRESSIONS WHICHBOTH OF THEM WERE UNCONSCIOUSLY GIVING AND RECEIVING

                             ON THE SHELF
IN FRANCE THE YOUNG GIRLS HAVE A DULL TIME OF IT TILL THEY ARE MARRIEDWHEN VIVE LA LIBERTÉ BECOMES THEIR MOTTO
 IN AMERICA AS EVERY ONEKNOWS GIRLS EARLY SIGN THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND ENJOY THEIRFREEDOM WITH REPUBLICAN ZEST BUT THE YOUNG MATRONS USUALLY ABDICATEWITH THE FIRST HEIR TO THE THRONE AND GO INTO A SECLUSION ALMOST ASCLOSE AS A FRENCH NUNNERY THOUGH BY NO MEANS AS QUIET
 WHETHER THEYLIKE IT OR NOT THEY ARE VIRTUALLY PUT UPON THE SHELF AS SOON AS THEWEDDING EXCITEMENT IS OVER AND MOST OF THEM MIGHT EXCLAIM AS DID AVERY PRETTY WOMAN THE OTHER DAY IM AS HANDSOME AS EVER BUT NO ONETAKES ANY NOTICE OF ME BECAUSE IM MARRIED
NOT BEING A BELLE OR EVEN A FASHIONABLE LADY MEG DID NOT EXPERIENCETHIS AFFLICTION TILL HER BABIES WERE A YEAR OLD FOR IN HER LITTLE WORLDPRIMITIVE CUSTOMS PREVAILED AND SHE FOUND HERSELF MORE ADMIRED ANDBELOVED THAN EVER
AS SHE WAS A WOMANLY LITTLE WOMAN THE MATERNAL INSTINCT WAS VERYSTRONG AND SHE WAS ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN HER CHILDREN TO THE UTTEREXCLUSION OF EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY ELSE
 DAY AND NIGHT SHE BROODEDOVER THEM WITH TIRELESS DEVOTION AND ANXIETY LEAVING JOHN TO THE TENDERMERCIES OF THE HELP FOR AN IRISH LADY NOW PRESIDED OVER THE KITCHENDEPARTMENT
 BEING A DOMESTIC MAN JOHN DECIDEDLY MISSED THE WIFELYATTENTIONS HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE BUT AS HE ADORED HISBABIES HE CHEERFULLY RELINQUISHED HIS COMFORT FOR A TIME SUPPOSINGWITH MASCULINE IGNORANCE THAT PEACE WOULD SOON BE RESTORED
 BUT THREEMONTHS PASSED AND THERE WAS NO RETURN OF REPOSE MEG LOOKED WORN ANDNERVOUS THE BABIES ABSORBED EVERY MINUTE OF HER TIME THE HOUSE WASNEGLECTED AND KITTY THE COOK WHO TOOK LIFE AISY KEPT HIM ON SHORTCOMMONS
 WHEN HE WENT OUT IN THE MORNING HE WAS BEWILDERED BY SMALLCOMMISSIONS FOR THE CAPTIVE MAMMA IF HE CAME GAYLY IN AT NIGHT EAGERTO EMBRACE HIS FAMILY HE WAS QUENCHED BY A HUSH
 THEY ARE JUST ASLEEPAFTER WORRYING ALL DAY
 IF HE PROPOSED A LITTLE AMUSEMENT AT HOME NOIT WOULD DISTURB THE BABIES
 IF HE HINTED AT A LECTURE OR CONCERT HEWAS ANSWERED WITH A REPROACHFUL LOOK AND A DECIDED LEAVE MY CHILDRENFOR PLEASURE NEVER
 HIS SLEEP WAS BROKEN BY INFANT WAILS AND VISIONSOF A PHANTOM FIGURE PACING NOISELESSLY TO AND FRO IN THE WATCHES OF THENIGHT HIS MEALS WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE FREQUENT FLIGHT OF THEPRESIDING GENIUS WHO DESERTED HIM HALFHELPED IF A MUFFLED CHIRPSOUNDED FROM THE NEST ABOVE AND WHEN HE READ HIS PAPER OF AN EVENINGDEMIS COLIC GOT INTO THE SHIPPINGLIST AND DAISYS FALL AFFECTED THEPRICE OF STOCKS FOR MRS
 BROOKE WAS ONLY INTERESTED IN DOMESTIC NEWS
THE POOR MAN WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THE CHILDREN HAD BEREFT HIM OFHIS WIFE HOME WAS MERELY A NURSERY AND THE PERPETUAL HUSHING MADEHIM FEEL LIKE A BRUTAL INTRUDER WHENEVER HE ENTERED THE SACRED PRECINCTSOF BABYLAND
 HE BORE IT VERY PATIENTLY FOR SIX MONTHS AND WHEN NOSIGNS OF AMENDMENT APPEARED HE DID WHAT OTHER PATERNAL EXILESDOTRIED TO GET A LITTLE COMFORT ELSEWHERE
 SCOTT HAD MARRIED AND GONETO HOUSEKEEPING NOT FAR OFF AND JOHN FELL INTO THE WAY OF RUNNING OVERFOR AN HOUR OR TWO OF AN EVENING WHEN HIS OWN PARLOR WAS EMPTY AND HISOWN WIFE SINGING LULLABIES THAT SEEMED TO HAVE NO END
 MRS
 SCOTT WAS ALIVELY PRETTY GIRL WITH NOTHING TO DO BUT BE AGREEABLE AND SHEPERFORMED HER MISSION MOST SUCCESSFULLY
 THE PARLOR WAS ALWAYS BRIGHTAND ATTRACTIVE THE CHESSBOARD READY THE PIANO IN TUNE PLENTY OF GAYGOSSIP AND A NICE LITTLE SUPPER SET FORTH IN TEMPTING STYLE
JOHN WOULD HAVE PREFERRED HIS OWN FIRESIDE IF IT HAD NOT BEEN SO LONELYBUT AS IT WAS HE GRATEFULLY TOOK THE NEXT BEST THING AND ENJOYED HISNEIGHBORS SOCIETY
MEG RATHER APPROVED OF THE NEW ARRANGEMENT AT FIRST AND FOUND IT ARELIEF TO KNOW THAT JOHN WAS HAVING A GOOD TIME INSTEAD OF DOZING IN THEPARLOR OR TRAMPING ABOUT THE HOUSE AND WAKING THE CHILDREN
 BUT BY ANDBY WHEN THE TEETHING WORRY WAS OVER AND THE IDOLS WENT TO SLEEP ATPROPER HOURS LEAVING MAMMA TIME TO REST SHE BEGAN TO MISS JOHN ANDFIND HER WORKBASKET DULL COMPANY WHEN HE WAS NOT SITTING OPPOSITE INHIS OLD DRESSINGGOWN COMFORTABLY SCORCHING HIS SLIPPERS ON THE FENDER
SHE WOULD NOT ASK HIM TO STAY AT HOME BUT FELT INJURED BECAUSE HE DIDNOT KNOW THAT SHE WANTED HIM WITHOUT BEING TOLD ENTIRELY FORGETTING THEMANY EVENINGS HE HAD WAITED FOR HER IN VAIN
 SHE WAS NERVOUS AND WORNOUT WITH WATCHING AND WORRY AND IN THAT UNREASONABLE FRAME OF MINDWHICH THE BEST OF MOTHERS OCCASIONALLY EXPERIENCE WHEN DOMESTIC CARESOPPRESS THEM
 WANT OF EXERCISE ROBS THEM OF CHEERFULNESS AND TOO MUCHDEVOTION TO THAT IDOL OF AMERICAN WOMEN THE TEAPOT MAKES THEM FEEL ASIF THEY WERE ALL NERVE AND NO MUSCLE
YES SHE WOULD SAY LOOKING IN THE GLASS IM GETTING OLD AND UGLYJOHN DOESNT FIND ME INTERESTING ANY LONGER SO HE LEAVES HIS FADED WIFEAND GOES TO SEE HIS PRETTY NEIGHBOR WHO HAS NO INCUMBRANCES
 WELL THEBABIES LOVE ME THEY DONT CARE IF I AM THIN AND PALE AND HAVENT TIMETO CRIMP MY HAIR THEY ARE MY COMFORT AND SOME DAY JOHN WILL SEE WHATIVE GLADLY SACRIFICED FOR THEM WONT HE MY PRECIOUS
TO WHICH PATHETIC APPEAL DAISY WOULD ANSWER WITH A COO OR DEMI WITH ACROW AND MEG WOULD PUT BY HER LAMENTATIONS FOR A MATERNAL REVEL WHICHSOOTHED HER SOLITUDE FOR THE TIME BEING
 BUT THE PAIN INCREASED ASPOLITICS ABSORBED JOHN WHO WAS ALWAYS RUNNING OVER TO DISCUSSINTERESTING POINTS WITH SCOTT QUITE UNCONSCIOUS THAT MEG MISSED HIM
NOT A WORD DID SHE SAY HOWEVER TILL HER MOTHER FOUND HER IN TEARS ONEDAY AND INSISTED ON KNOWING WHAT THE MATTER WAS FOR MEGS DROOPINGSPIRITS HAD NOT ESCAPED HER OBSERVATION
I WOULDNT TELL ANY ONE EXCEPT YOU MOTHER BUT I REALLY DO NEEDADVICE FOR IF JOHN GOES ON SO MUCH LONGER I MIGHT AS WELL BE WIDOWEDREPLIED MRS
 BROOKE DRYING HER TEARS ON DAISYS BIB WITH AN INJUREDAIR
GOES ON HOW MY DEAR
 ASKED HER MOTHER ANXIOUSLY
HES AWAY ALL DAY AND AT NIGHT WHEN I WANT TO SEE HIM HE ISCONTINUALLY GOING OVER TO THE SCOTTS
 IT ISNT FAIR THAT I SHOULD HAVETHE HARDEST WORK AND NEVER ANY AMUSEMENT

SO ARE WOMEN DONT BLAME JOHN TILL YOU SEE WHERE YOU ARE WRONGYOURSELF
BUT IT CANT BE RIGHT FOR HIM TO NEGLECT ME
DONT YOU NEGLECT HIM
WHY MOTHER I THOUGHT YOUD TAKE MY PART
SO I DO AS FAR AS SYMPATHIZING GOES BUT I THINK THE FAULT IS YOURSMEG
I DONT SEE HOW
LET ME SHOW YOU
 DID JOHN EVER NEGLECT YOU AS YOU CALL IT WHILE YOUMADE IT A POINT TO GIVE HIM YOUR SOCIETY OF AN EVENING HIS ONLY LEISURETIME
NO BUT I CANT DO IT NOW WITH TWO BABIES TO TEND
I THINK YOU COULD DEAR AND I THINK YOU OUGHT
 MAY I SPEAK QUITEFREELY AND WILL YOU REMEMBER THAT ITS MOTHER WHO BLAMES AS WELL ASMOTHER WHO SYMPATHIZES
INDEED I WILL
 SPEAK TO ME AS IF I WERE LITTLE MEG AGAIN
 I OFTEN FEELAS IF I NEEDED TEACHING MORE THAN EVER SINCE THESE BABIES LOOK TO ME FOREVERYTHING
MEG DREW HER LOW CHAIR BESIDE HER MOTHERS AND WITH A LITTLEINTERRUPTION IN EITHER LAP THE TWO WOMEN ROCKED AND TALKED LOVINGLYTOGETHER FEELING THAT THE TIE OF MOTHERHOOD MADE THEM MORE ONE THANEVER
YOU HAVE ONLY MADE THE MISTAKE THAT MOST YOUNG WIVES MAKEFORGOTTENYOUR DUTY TO YOUR HUSBAND IN YOUR LOVE FOR YOUR CHILDREN
 A VERY NATURALAND FORGIVABLE MISTAKE MEG BUT ONE THAT HAD BETTER BE REMEDIED BEFOREYOU TAKE TO DIFFERENT WAYS FOR CHILDREN SHOULD DRAW YOU NEARER THANEVER NOT SEPARATE YOU AS IF THEY WERE ALL YOURS AND JOHN HAD NOTHINGTO DO BUT SUPPORT THEM
 IVE SEEN IT FOR SOME WEEKS BUT HAVE NOTSPOKEN FEELING SURE IT WOULD COME RIGHT IN TIME
IM AFRAID IT WONT
 IF I ASK HIM TO STAY HELL THINK IM JEALOUS ANDI WOULDNT INSULT HIM BY SUCH AN IDEA
 HE DOESNT SEE THAT I WANT HIMAND I DONT KNOW HOW TO TELL HIM WITHOUT WORDS
MAKE IT SO PLEASANT HE WONT WANT TO GO AWAY
 MY DEAR HES LONGING FORHIS LITTLE HOME BUT IT ISNT HOME WITHOUT YOU AND YOU ARE ALWAYS INTHE NURSERY
OUGHTNT I TO BE THERE
NOT ALL THE TIME TOO MUCH CONFINEMENT MAKES YOU NERVOUS AND THEN YOUARE UNFITTED FOR EVERYTHING
 BESIDES YOU OWE SOMETHING TO JOHN AS WELLAS TO THE BABIES DONT NEGLECT HUSBAND FOR CHILDREN DONT SHUT HIM OUTOF THE NURSERY BUT TEACH HIM HOW TO HELP IN IT
 HIS PLACE IS THERE ASWELL AS YOURS AND THE CHILDREN NEED HIM LET HIM FEEL THAT HE HAS HISPART TO DO AND HE WILL DO IT GLADLY AND FAITHFULLY AND IT WILL BEBETTER FOR YOU ALL
YOU REALLY THINK SO MOTHER
I KNOW IT MEG FOR IVE TRIED IT AND I SELDOM GIVE ADVICE UNLESS IVEPROVED ITS PRACTICABILITY
 WHEN YOU AND JO WERE LITTLE I WENT ON JUSTAS YOU ARE FEELING AS IF I DIDNT DO MY DUTY UNLESS I DEVOTED MYSELFWHOLLY TO YOU
 POOR FATHER TOOK TO HIS BOOKS AFTER I HAD REFUSED ALLOFFERS OF HELP AND LEFT ME TO TRY MY EXPERIMENT ALONE
 I STRUGGLEDALONG AS WELL AS I COULD BUT JO WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME
 I NEARLY SPOILTHER BY INDULGENCE
 YOU WERE POORLY AND I WORRIED ABOUT YOU TILL I FELLSICK MYSELF
 THEN FATHER CAME TO THE RESCUE QUIETLY MANAGED EVERYTHINGAND MADE HIMSELF SO HELPFUL THAT I SAW MY MISTAKE AND NEVER HAVE BEENABLE TO GET ON WITHOUT HIM SINCE
 THAT IS THE SECRET OF OUR HOMEHAPPINESS HE DOES NOT LET BUSINESS WEAN HIM FROM THE LITTLE CARES ANDDUTIES THAT AFFECT US ALL AND I TRY NOT TO LET DOMESTIC WORRIES DESTROYMY INTEREST IN HIS PURSUITS
 EACH DO OUR PART ALONE IN MANY THINGS BUTAT HOME WE WORK TOGETHER ALWAYS
IT IS SO MOTHER AND MY GREAT WISH IS TO BE TO MY HUSBAND AND CHILDRENWHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TO YOURS
 SHOW ME HOW ILL DO ANYTHING YOU SAY
YOU ALWAYS WERE MY DOCILE DAUGHTER
 WELL DEAR IF I WERE YOU ID LETJOHN HAVE MORE TO DO WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF DEMI FOR THE BOY NEEDSTRAINING AND ITS NONE TOO SOON TO BEGIN
 THEN ID DO WHAT I HAVE OFTENPROPOSED LET HANNAH COME AND HELP YOU SHE IS A CAPITAL NURSE AND YOUMAY TRUST THE PRECIOUS BABIES TO HER WHILE YOU DO MORE HOUSEWORK
 YOUNEED THE EXERCISE HANNAH WOULD ENJOY THE REST AND JOHN WOULD FIND HISWIFE AGAIN
 GO OUT MORE KEEP CHEERFUL AS WELL AS BUSY FOR YOU ARE THESUNSHINEMAKER OF THE FAMILY AND IF YOU GET DISMAL THERE IS NO FAIRWEATHER
 THEN ID TRY TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN WHATEVER JOHN LIKESTALKWITH HIM LET HIM READ TO YOU EXCHANGE IDEAS AND HELP EACH OTHER INTHAT WAY
 DONT SHUT YOURSELF UP IN A BANDBOX BECAUSE YOU ARE A WOMANBUT UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON AND EDUCATE YOURSELF TO TAKE YOUR PARTIN THE WORLDS WORK FOR IT ALL AFFECTS YOU AND YOURS
JOHN IS SO SENSIBLE IM AFRAID HE WILL THINK IM STUPID IF I ASKQUESTIONS ABOUT POLITICS AND THINGS
I DONT BELIEVE HE WOULD LOVE COVERS A MULTITUDE OF SINS AND OF WHOMCOULD YOU ASK MORE FREELY THAN OF HIM
 TRY IT AND SEE IF HE DOESNTFIND YOUR SOCIETY FAR MORE AGREEABLE THAN MRS
 SCOTTS SUPPERS
I WILL
 POOR JOHN
 IM AFRAID I HAVE NEGLECTED HIM SADLY BUT ITHOUGHT I WAS RIGHT AND HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING
HE TRIED NOT TO BE SELFISH BUT HE HAS FELT RATHER FORLORN I FANCY
THIS IS JUST THE TIME MEG WHEN YOUNG MARRIED PEOPLE ARE APT TO GROWAPART AND THE VERY TIME WHEN THEY OUGHT TO BE MOST TOGETHER FOR THEFIRST TENDERNESS SOON WEARS OFF UNLESS CARE IS TAKEN TO PRESERVE ITAND NO TIME IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND PRECIOUS TO PARENTS AS THE FIRST YEARSOF THE LITTLE LIVES GIVEN THEM TO TRAIN
 DONT LET JOHN BE A STRANGER TOTHE BABIES FOR THEY WILL DO MORE TO KEEP HIM SAFE AND HAPPY IN THISWORLD OF TRIAL AND TEMPTATION THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND THROUGH THEM YOUWILL LEARN TO KNOW AND LOVE ONE ANOTHER AS YOU SHOULD
 NOW DEARGOODBY THINK OVER MOTHERS PREACHMENT ACT UPON IT IF IT SEEMS GOODAND GOD BLESS YOU ALL
MEG DID THINK IT OVER FOUND IT GOOD AND ACTED UPON IT THOUGH THEFIRST ATTEMPT WAS NOT MADE EXACTLY AS SHE PLANNED TO HAVE IT
 OF COURSETHE CHILDREN TYRANNIZED OVER HER AND RULED THE HOUSE AS SOON AS THEYFOUND OUT THAT KICKING AND SQUALLING BROUGHT THEM WHATEVER THEY WANTED
MAMMA WAS AN ABJECT SLAVE TO THEIR CAPRICES BUT PAPA WAS NOT SO EASILYSUBJUGATED AND OCCASIONALLY AFFLICTED HIS TENDER SPOUSE BY AN ATTEMPTAT PATERNAL DISCIPLINE WITH HIS OBSTREPEROUS SON
 FOR DEMI INHERITED ATRIFLE OF HIS SIRES FIRMNESS OF CHARACTERWE WONT CALL ITOBSTINACYAND WHEN HE MADE UP HIS LITTLE MIND TO HAVE OR TO DOANYTHING ALL THE KINGS HORSES AND ALL THE KINGS MEN COULD NOT CHANGETHAT PERTINACIOUS LITTLE MIND
 MAMMA THOUGHT THE DEAR TOO YOUNG TO BETAUGHT TO CONQUER HIS PREJUDICES BUT PAPA BELIEVED THAT IT NEVER WASTOO SOON TO LEARN OBEDIENCE SO MASTER DEMI EARLY DISCOVERED THAT WHENHE UNDERTOOK TO WRASTLE WITH PARPAR HE ALWAYS GOT THE WORST OF ITYET LIKE THE ENGLISHMAN BABY RESPECTED THE MAN WHO CONQUERED HIM ANDLOVED THE FATHER WHOSE GRAVE NO NO WAS MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN ALLMAMMAS LOVEPATS
A FEW DAYS AFTER THE TALK WITH HER MOTHER MEG RESOLVED TO TRY A SOCIALEVENING WITH JOHN SO SHE ORDERED A NICE SUPPER SET THE PARLOR INORDER DRESSED HERSELF PRETTILY AND PUT THE CHILDREN TO BED EARLY THATNOTHING SHOULD INTERFERE WITH HER EXPERIMENT
 BUT UNFORTUNATELY DEMISMOST UNCONQUERABLE PREJUDICE WAS AGAINST GOING TO BED AND THAT NIGHT HEDECIDED TO GO ON A RAMPAGE SO POOR MEG SUNG AND ROCKED TOLD STORIESAND TRIED EVERY SLEEPPROVOKING WILE SHE COULD DEVISE BUT ALL IN VAINTHE BIG EYES WOULDNT SHUT AND LONG AFTER DAISY HAD GONE TO BYELOWLIKE THE CHUBBY LITTLE BUNCH OF GOODNATURE SHE WAS NAUGHTY DEMI LAYSTARING AT THE LIGHT WITH THE MOST DISCOURAGINGLY WIDEAWAKE EXPRESSIONOF COUNTENANCE

BUT EVEN THAT REFUGE PROVED UNAVAILING FOR HE WAS DELIVERED OVER TO THEENEMY WITH A BE GENTLE WITH HIM JOHN WHICH STRUCK THE CULPRIT WITHDISMAY FOR WHEN MAMMA DESERTED HIM THEN THE JUDGMENTDAY WAS AT HAND
BEREFT OF HIS CAKE DEFRAUDED OF HIS FROLIC AND BORNE AWAY BY A STRONGHAND TO THAT DETESTED BED POOR DEMI COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIS WRATH BUTOPENLY DEFIED PAPA AND KICKED AND SCREAMED LUSTILY ALL THE WAYUPSTAIRS
 THE MINUTE HE WAS PUT INTO BED ON ONE SIDE HE ROLLED OUT ONTHE OTHER AND MADE FOR THE DOOR ONLY TO BE IGNOMINIOUSLY CAUGHT UP BYTHE TAIL OF HIS LITTLE TOGA AND PUT BACK AGAIN WHICH LIVELYPERFORMANCE WAS KEPT UP TILL THE YOUNG MANS STRENGTH GAVE OUT WHEN HEDEVOTED HIMSELF TO ROARING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE
 THIS VOCAL EXERCISEUSUALLY CONQUERED MEG BUT JOHN SAT AS UNMOVED AS THE POST WHICH ISPOPULARLY BELIEVED TO BE DEAF
 NO COAXING NO SUGAR NO LULLABY NOSTORY EVEN THE LIGHT WAS PUT OUT AND ONLY THE RED GLOW OF THE FIREENLIVENED THE BIG DARK WHICH DEMI REGARDED WITH CURIOSITY RATHER THANFEAR
 THIS NEW ORDER OF THINGS DISGUSTED HIM AND HE HOWLED DISMALLY FORMARMAR AS HIS ANGRY PASSIONS SUBSIDED AND RECOLLECTIONS OF HISTENDER BONDWOMAN RETURNED TO THE CAPTIVE AUTOCRAT

WHEN JOHN SPOKE IN THAT MASTERFUL TONE MEG ALWAYS OBEYED AND NEVERREGRETTED HER DOCILITY
PLEASE LET ME KISS HIM ONCE JOHN
CERTAINLY
 DEMI SAY GOODNIGHT TO MAMMA AND LET HER GO AND RESTFOR SHE IS VERY TIRED WITH TAKING CARE OF YOU ALL DAY
MEG ALWAYS INSISTED UPON IT THAT THE KISS WON THE VICTORY FOR AFTER ITWAS GIVEN DEMI SOBBED MORE QUIETLY AND LAY QUITE STILL AT THE BOTTOMOF THE BED WHITHER HE HAD WRIGGLED IN HIS ANGUISH OF MIND
POOR LITTLE MAN HES WORN OUT WITH SLEEP AND CRYING
 ILL COVER HIMUP AND THEN GO AND SET MEGS HEART AT REST THOUGHT JOHN CREEPING TOTHE BEDSIDE HOPING TO FIND HIS REBELLIOUS HEIR ASLEEP
BUT HE WASNT FOR THE MOMENT HIS FATHER PEEPED AT HIM DEMIS EYESOPENED HIS LITTLE CHIN BEGAN TO QUIVER AND HE PUT UP HIS ARMS SAYINGWITH A PENITENT HICCOUGH MES DOOD NOW
SITTING ON THE STAIRS OUTSIDE MEG WONDERED AT THE LONG SILENCE WHICHFOLLOWED THE UPROAR AND AFTER IMAGINING ALL SORTS OF IMPOSSIBLEACCIDENTS SHE SLIPPED INTO THE ROOM TO SET HER FEARS AT REST
 DEMI LAYFAST ASLEEP NOT IN HIS USUAL SPREADEAGLE ATTITUDE BUT IN A SUBDUEDBUNCH CUDDLED CLOSE IN THE CIRCLE OF HIS FATHERS ARM AND HOLDING HISFATHERS FINGER AS IF HE FELT THAT JUSTICE WAS TEMPERED WITH MERCY ANDHAD GONE TO SLEEP A SADDER AND A WISER BABY
 SO HELD JOHN HAD WAITEDWITH WOMANLY PATIENCE TILL THE LITTLE HAND RELAXED ITS HOLD AND WHILEWAITING HAD FALLEN ASLEEP MORE TIRED BY THAT TUSSLE WITH HIS SON THANWITH HIS WHOLE DAYS WORK

WHEN JOHN CAME DOWN AT LAST EXPECTING TO FIND A PENSIVE OR REPROACHFULWIFE HE WAS AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO FIND MEG PLACIDLY TRIMMING A BONNETAND TO BE GREETED WITH THE REQUEST TO READ SOMETHING ABOUT THE ELECTIONIF HE WAS NOT TOO TIRED
 JOHN SAW IN A MINUTE THAT A REVOLUTION OF SOMEKIND WAS GOING ON BUT WISELY ASKED NO QUESTIONS KNOWING THAT MEG WASSUCH A TRANSPARENT LITTLE PERSON SHE COULDNT KEEP A SECRET TO SAVE HERLIFE AND THEREFORE THE CLEW WOULD SOON APPEAR
 HE READ A LONG DEBATEWITH THE MOST AMIABLE READINESS AND THEN EXPLAINED IT IN HIS MOST LUCIDMANNER WHILE MEG TRIED TO LOOK DEEPLY INTERESTED TO ASK INTELLIGENTQUESTIONS AND KEEP HER THOUGHTS FROM WANDERING FROM THE STATE OF THENATION TO THE STATE OF HER BONNET
 IN HER SECRET SOUL HOWEVER SHEDECIDED THAT POLITICS WERE AS BAD AS MATHEMATICS AND THAT THE MISSIONOF POLITICIANS SEEMED TO BE CALLING EACH OTHER NAMES BUT SHE KEPT THESEFEMININE IDEAS TO HERSELF AND WHEN JOHN PAUSED SHOOK HER HEAD ANDSAID WITH WHAT SHE THOUGHT DIPLOMATIC AMBIGUITYWELL I REALLY DONT SEE WHAT WE ARE COMING TO
JOHN LAUGHED AND WATCHED HER FOR A MINUTE AS SHE POISED A PRETTYLITTLE PREPARATION OF LACE AND FLOWERS ON HER HAND AND REGARDED IT WITHTHE GENUINE INTEREST WHICH HIS HARANGUE HAD FAILED TO WAKEN
SHE IS TRYING TO LIKE POLITICS FOR MY SAKE SO ILL TRY AND LIKEMILLINERY FOR HERS THATS ONLY FAIR THOUGHT JOHN THE JUST ADDINGALOUDTHATS VERY PRETTY IS IT WHAT YOU CALL A BREAKFASTCAP

 YOU DONT OBJECT IHOPE
NEVER MIND WHAT JOHN SAID OR WHAT A VERY NARROW ESCAPE THE LITTLEBONNET HAD FROM UTTER RUIN ALL THAT WE HAVE ANY BUSINESS TO KNOW ISTHAT JOHN DID NOT APPEAR TO OBJECT JUDGING FROM THE CHANGES WHICHGRADUALLY TOOK PLACE IN THE HOUSE AND ITS INMATES
 IT WAS NOT ALLPARADISE BY ANY MEANS BUT EVERY ONE WAS BETTER FOR THE DIVISION OFLABOR SYSTEM THE CHILDREN THROVE UNDER THE PATERNAL RULE FOR ACCURATESTEADFAST JOHN BROUGHT ORDER AND OBEDIENCE INTO BABYDOM WHILE MEGRECOVERED HER SPIRITS AND COMPOSED HER NERVES BY PLENTY OF WHOLESOMEEXERCISE A LITTLE PLEASURE AND MUCH CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATION WITH HERSENSIBLE HUSBAND
 HOME GREW HOMELIKE AGAIN AND JOHN HAD NO WISH TOLEAVE IT UNLESS HE TOOK MEG WITH HIM
 THE SCOTTS CAME TO THE BROOKESNOW AND EVERY ONE FOUND THE LITTLE HOUSE A CHEERFUL PLACE FULL OFHAPPINESS CONTENT AND FAMILY LOVE

 IT IS ALWAYS SO QUIET AND PLEASANT HERE IT DOES ME GOOD MEGSHE USED TO SAY LOOKING ABOUT HER WITH WISTFUL EYES AS IF TRYING TODISCOVER THE CHARM THAT SHE MIGHT USE IT IN HER GREAT HOUSE FULL OFSPLENDID LONELINESS FOR THERE WERE NO RIOTOUS SUNNYFACED BABIESTHERE AND NED LIVED IN A WORLD OF HIS OWN WHERE THERE WAS NO PLACE FORHER
THIS HOUSEHOLD HAPPINESS DID NOT COME ALL AT ONCE BUT JOHN AND MEG HADFOUND THE KEY TO IT AND EACH YEAR OF MARRIED LIFE TAUGHT THEM HOW TOUSE IT UNLOCKING THE TREASURIES OF REAL HOMELOVE AND MUTUALHELPFULNESS WHICH THE POOREST MAY POSSESS AND THE RICHEST CANNOT BUY

LAURIE WENT TO NICE INTENDING TO STAY A WEEK AND REMAINED A MONTH
 HEWAS TIRED OF WANDERING ABOUT ALONE AND AMYS FAMILIAR PRESENCE SEEMEDTO GIVE A HOMELIKE CHARM TO THE FOREIGN SCENES IN WHICH SHE BORE APART
 HE RATHER MISSED THE PETTING HE USED TO RECEIVE AND ENJOYED ATASTE OF IT AGAIN FOR NO ATTENTIONS HOWEVER FLATTERING FROMSTRANGERS WERE HALF SO PLEASANT AS THE SISTERLY ADORATION OF THE GIRLSAT HOME
 AMY NEVER WOULD PET HIM LIKE THE OTHERS BUT SHE WAS VERY GLADTO SEE HIM NOW AND QUITE CLUNG TO HIM FEELING THAT HE WAS THEREPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEAR FAMILY FOR WHOM SHE LONGED MORE THAN SHEWOULD CONFESS
 THEY NATURALLY TOOK COMFORT IN EACH OTHERS SOCIETY ANDWERE MUCH TOGETHER RIDING WALKING DANCING OR DAWDLING FOR AT NICENO ONE CAN BE VERY INDUSTRIOUS DURING THE GAY SEASON
 BUT WHILEAPPARENTLY AMUSING THEMSELVES IN THE MOST CARELESS FASHION THEY WEREHALFCONSCIOUSLY MAKING DISCOVERIES AND FORMING OPINIONS ABOUT EACHOTHER
 AMY ROSE DAILY IN THE ESTIMATION OF HER FRIEND BUT HE SUNK INHERS AND EACH FELT THE TRUTH BEFORE A WORD WAS SPOKEN
 AMY TRIED TOPLEASE AND SUCCEEDED FOR SHE WAS GRATEFUL FOR THE MANY PLEASURES HEGAVE HER AND REPAID HIM WITH THE LITTLE SERVICES TO WHICH WOMANLY WOMENKNOW HOW TO LEND AN INDESCRIBABLE CHARM
 LAURIE MADE NO EFFORT OF ANYKIND BUT JUST LET HIMSELF DRIFT ALONG AS COMFORTABLY AS POSSIBLETRYING TO FORGET AND FEELING THAT ALL WOMEN OWED HIM A KIND WORDBECAUSE ONE HAD BEEN COLD TO HIM
 IT COST HIM NO EFFORT TO BE GENEROUSAND HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN AMY ALL THE TRINKETS IN NICE IF SHE WOULD HAVETAKEN THEM BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE FELT THAT HE COULD NOT CHANGE THEOPINION SHE WAS FORMING OF HIM AND HE RATHER DREADED THE KEEN BLUE EYESTHAT SEEMED TO WATCH HIM WITH SUCH HALFSORROWFUL HALFSCORNFULSURPRISE
ALL THE REST HAVE GONE TO MONACO FOR THE DAY I PREFERRED TO STAY ATHOME AND WRITE LETTERS

THEN ILL GO WITH PLEASURE AND HE PUT OUT HIS HAND FOR HERSKETCHBOOK
 BUT SHE TUCKED IT UNDER HER ARM WITH A SHARPDONT TROUBLE YOURSELF ITS NO EXERTION TO ME BUT YOU DONT LOOKEQUAL TO IT
LAURIE LIFTED HIS EYEBROWS AND FOLLOWED AT A LEISURELY PACE AS SHE RANDOWNSTAIRS BUT WHEN THEY GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE HE TOOK THE REINSHIMSELF AND LEFT LITTLE BAPTISTE NOTHING TO DO BUT FOLD HIS ARMS ANDFALL ASLEEP ON HIS PERCH
THE TWO NEVER QUARRELLEDAMY WAS TOO WELLBRED AND JUST NOW LAURIEWAS TOO LAZY SO IN A MINUTE HE PEEPED UNDER HER HATBRIM WITH ANINQUIRING AIR SHE ANSWERED WITH A SMILE AND THEY WENT ON TOGETHER INTHE MOST AMICABLE MANNER
IT WAS A LOVELY DRIVE ALONG WINDING ROADS RICH IN THE PICTURESQUESCENES THAT DELIGHT BEAUTYLOVING EYES

 THERE ABARELEGGED SHEPHERD IN WOODEN SHOES POINTED HAT AND ROUGH JACKETOVER ONE SHOULDER SAT PIPING ON A STONE WHILE HIS GOATS SKIPPED AMONGTHE ROCKS OR LAY AT HIS FEET
 MEEK MOUSECOLORED DONKEYS LADEN WITHPANNIERS OF FRESHLYCUT GRASS PASSED BY WITH A PRETTY GIRL IN ACAPALINE SITTING BETWEEN THE GREEN PILES OR AN OLD WOMAN SPINNINGWITH A DISTAFF AS SHE WENT
 BROWN SOFTEYED CHILDREN RAN OUT FROM THEQUAINT STONE HOVELS TO OFFER NOSEGAYS OR BUNCHES OF ORANGES STILL ONTHE BOUGH
 GNARLED OLIVETREES COVERED THE HILLS WITH THEIR DUSKYFOLIAGE FRUIT HUNG GOLDEN IN THE ORCHARD AND GREAT SCARLET ANEMONESFRINGED THE ROADSIDE WHILE BEYOND GREEN SLOPES AND CRAGGY HEIGHTS THEMARITIME ALPS ROSE SHARP AND WHITE AGAINST THE BLUE ITALIAN SKY
VALROSA WELL DESERVED ITS NAME FOR IN THAT CLIMATE OF PERPETUALSUMMER ROSES BLOSSOMED EVERYWHERE
 THEY OVERHUNG THE ARCHWAY THRUSTTHEMSELVES BETWEEN THE BARS OF THE GREAT GATE WITH A SWEET WELCOME TOPASSERSBY AND LINED THE AVENUE WINDING THROUGH LEMONTREES ANDFEATHERY PALMS UP TO THE VILLA ON THE HILL
 EVERY SHADOWY NOOK WHERESEATS INVITED ONE TO STOP AND REST WAS A MASS OF BLOOM EVERY COOLGROTTO HAD ITS MARBLE NYMPH SMILING FROM A VEIL OF FLOWERS AND EVERYFOUNTAIN REFLECTED CRIMSON WHITE OR PALE PINK ROSES LEANING DOWN TOSMILE AT THEIR OWN BEAUTY
 ROSES COVERED THE WALLS OF THE HOUSE DRAPEDTHE CORNICES CLIMBED THE PILLARS AND RAN RIOT OVER THE BALUSTRADE OFTHE WIDE TERRACE WHENCE ONE LOOKED DOWN ON THE SUNNY MEDITERRANEAN ANDTHE WHITEWALLED CITY ON ITS SHORE
THIS IS A REGULAR HONEYMOON PARADISE ISNT IT
 DID YOU EVER SEE SUCHROSES
 ASKED AMY PAUSING ON THE TERRACE TO ENJOY THE VIEW AND ALUXURIOUS WHIFF OF PERFUME THAT CAME WANDERING BY
NO NOR FELT SUCH THORNS RETURNED LAURIE WITH HIS THUMB IN HISMOUTH AFTER A VAIN ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE A SOLITARY SCARLET FLOWER THATGREW JUST BEYOND HIS REACH
TRY LOWER DOWN AND PICK THOSE THAT HAVE NO THORNS SAID AMYGATHERING THREE OF THE TINY CREAMCOLORED ONES THAT STARRED THE WALLBEHIND HER
 SHE PUT THEM IN HIS BUTTONHOLE AS A PEACEOFFERING AND HESTOOD A MINUTE LOOKING DOWN AT THEM WITH A CURIOUS EXPRESSION FOR INTHE ITALIAN PART OF HIS NATURE THERE WAS A TOUCH OF SUPERSTITION ANDHE WAS JUST THEN IN THAT STATE OF HALFSWEET HALFBITTER MELANCHOLYWHEN IMAGINATIVE YOUNG MEN FIND SIGNIFICANCE IN TRIFLES AND FOOD FORROMANCE EVERYWHERE
 HE HAD THOUGHT OF JO IN REACHING AFTER THE THORNYRED ROSE FOR VIVID FLOWERS BECAME HER AND SHE HAD OFTEN WORN ONES LIKETHAT FROM THE GREENHOUSE AT HOME
 THE PALE ROSES AMY GAVE HIM WERE THESORT THAT THE ITALIANS LAY IN DEAD HANDS NEVER IN BRIDAL WREATHS ANDFOR A MOMENT HE WONDERED IF THE OMEN WAS FOR JO OR FOR HIMSELF BUT THENEXT INSTANT HIS AMERICAN COMMONSENSE GOT THE BETTER OF SENTIMENTALITYAND HE LAUGHED A HEARTIER LAUGH THAN AMY HAD HEARD SINCE HE CAME
ITS GOOD ADVICE YOUD BETTER TAKE IT AND SAVE YOUR FINGERS SHESAID THINKING HER SPEECH AMUSED HIM
THANK YOU I WILL HE ANSWERED IN JEST AND A FEW MONTHS LATER HE DIDIT IN EARNEST
LAURIE WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO YOUR GRANDFATHER
 SHE ASKED PRESENTLYAS SHE SETTLED HERSELF ON A RUSTIC SEAT
VERY SOON
YOU HAVE SAID THAT A DOZEN TIMES WITHIN THE LAST THREE WEEKS
I DARE SAY SHORT ANSWERS SAVE TROUBLE
HE EXPECTS YOU AND YOU REALLY OUGHT TO GO
HOSPITABLE CREATURE
 I KNOW IT
THEN WHY DONT YOU DO IT
NATURAL DEPRAVITY I SUPPOSE
NATURAL INDOLENCE YOU MEAN
 ITS REALLY DREADFUL
 AND AMY LOOKEDSEVERE
NOT SO BAD AS IT SEEMS FOR I SHOULD ONLY PLAGUE HIM IF I WENT SO IMIGHT AS WELL STAY AND PLAGUE YOU A LITTLE LONGER YOU CAN BEAR ITBETTER IN FACT I THINK IT AGREES WITH YOU EXCELLENTLY AND LAURIECOMPOSED HIMSELF FOR A LOUNGE ON THE BROAD LEDGE OF THE BALUSTRADE
AMY SHOOK HER HEAD AND OPENED HER SKETCHBOOK WITH AN AIR OFRESIGNATION BUT SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND TO LECTURE THAT BOY AND INA MINUTE SHE BEGAN AGAIN
WHAT ARE YOU DOING JUST NOW
WATCHING LIZARDS
NO NO I MEAN WHAT DO YOU INTEND AND WISH TO DO
SMOKE A CIGARETTE IF YOULL ALLOW ME
HOW PROVOKING YOU ARE
 I DONT APPROVE OF CIGARS AND I WILL ONLY ALLOWIT ON CONDITION THAT YOU LET ME PUT YOU INTO MY SKETCH I NEED AFIGURE
WITH ALL THE PLEASURE IN LIFE
 HOW WILL YOU HAVE MEFULLLENGTH ORTHREEQUARTERS ON MY HEAD OR MY HEELS
 I SHOULD RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST ARECUMBENT POSTURE THEN PUT YOURSELF IN ALSO AND CALL IT DOLCE FARNIENTE
STAY AS YOU ARE AND GO TO SLEEP IF YOU LIKE
 I INTEND TO WORK HARDSAID AMY IN HER MOST ENERGETIC TONE
WHAT DELIGHTFUL ENTHUSIASM
 AND HE LEANED AGAINST A TALL URN WITH ANAIR OF ENTIRE SATISFACTION
WHAT WOULD JO SAY IF SHE SAW YOU NOW
 ASKED AMY IMPATIENTLY HOPING TOSTIR HIM UP BY THE MENTION OF HER STILL MORE ENERGETIC SISTERS NAME
AS USUAL GO AWAY TEDDY IM BUSY
 HE LAUGHED AS HE SPOKE BUT THELAUGH WAS NOT NATURAL AND A SHADE PASSED OVER HIS FACE FOR THEUTTERANCE OF THE FAMILIAR NAME TOUCHED THE WOUND THAT WAS NOT HEALEDYET
 BOTH TONE AND SHADOW STRUCK AMY FOR SHE HAD SEEN AND HEARD THEMBEFORE AND NOW SHE LOOKED UP IN TIME TO CATCH A NEW EXPRESSION ONLAURIES FACEA HARD BITTER LOOK FULL OF PAIN DISSATISFACTION ANDREGRET
 IT WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD STUDY IT AND THE LISTLESSEXPRESSION BACK AGAIN
 SHE WATCHED HIM FOR A MOMENT WITH ARTISTICPLEASURE THINKING HOW LIKE AN ITALIAN HE LOOKED AS HE LAY BASKING INTHE SUN WITH UNCOVERED HEAD AND EYES FULL OF SOUTHERN DREAMINESS FORHE SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN HER AND FALLEN INTO A REVERIE
YOU LOOK LIKE THE EFFIGY OF A YOUNG KNIGHT ASLEEP ON HIS TOMB SHESAID CAREFULLY TRACING THE WELLCUT PROFILE DEFINED AGAINST THE DARKSTONE
WISH I WAS
THATS A FOOLISH WISH UNLESS YOU HAVE SPOILT YOUR LIFE
 YOU ARE SOCHANGED I SOMETIMES THINK THERE AMY STOPPED WITH A HALFTIMIDHALFWISTFUL LOOK MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN HER UNFINISHED SPEECH
LAURIE SAW AND UNDERSTOOD THE AFFECTIONATE ANXIETY WHICH SHE HESITATEDTO EXPRESS AND LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO HER EYES SAID JUST AS HE USED TOSAY IT TO HER MOTHERITS ALL RIGHT MAAM
THAT SATISFIED HER AND SET AT REST THE DOUBTS THAT HAD BEGUN TO WORRYHER LATELY
 IT ALSO TOUCHED HER AND SHE SHOWED THAT IT DID BY THECORDIAL TONE IN WHICH SHE SAIDIM GLAD OF THAT
 I DIDNT THINK YOUD BEEN A VERY BAD BOY BUT IFANCIED YOU MIGHT HAVE WASTED MONEY AT THAT WICKED BADENBADEN LOSTYOUR HEART TO SOME CHARMING FRENCHWOMAN WITH A HUSBAND OR GOT INTO SOMEOF THE SCRAPES THAT YOUNG MEN SEEM TO CONSIDER A NECESSARY PART OF AFOREIGN TOUR
 DONT STAY OUT THERE IN THE SUN COME AND LIE ON THE GRASSHERE AND LET US BE FRIENDLY AS JO USED TO SAY WHEN WE GOT IN THESOFACORNER AND TOLD SECRETS
         ILLUSTRATION LAURIE THREW HIMSELF DOWN ON THE TURFLAURIE OBEDIENTLY THREW HIMSELF DOWN ON THE TURF AND BEGAN TO AMUSEHIMSELF BY STICKING DAISIES INTO THE RIBBONS OF AMYS HAT THAT LAYTHERE
IM ALL READY FOR THE SECRETS AND HE GLANCED UP WITH A DECIDEDEXPRESSION OF INTEREST IN HIS EYES
IVE NONE TO TELL YOU MAY BEGIN
HAVENT ONE TO BLESS MYSELF WITH
 I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOUD HAD SOME NEWSFROM HOME
YOU HAVE HEARD ALL THAT HAS COME LATELY
 DONT YOU HEAR OFTEN
 IFANCIED JO WOULD SEND YOU VOLUMES
SHES VERY BUSY IM ROVING ABOUT SO ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE REGULARYOU KNOW
 WHEN DO YOU BEGIN YOUR GREAT WORK OF ART RAPHAELLA
 HEASKED CHANGING THE SUBJECT ABRUPTLY AFTER ANOTHER PAUSE IN WHICH HEHAD BEEN WONDERING IF AMY KNEW HIS SECRET AND WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT
NEVER SHE ANSWERED WITH A DESPONDENT BUT DECIDED AIR
 ROME TOOK ALLTHE VANITY OUT OF ME FOR AFTER SEEING THE WONDERS THERE I FELT TOOINSIGNIFICANT TO LIVE AND GAVE UP ALL MY FOOLISH HOPES IN DESPAIR
WHY SHOULD YOU WITH SO MUCH ENERGY AND TALENT
THATS JUST WHYBECAUSE TALENT ISNT GENIUS AND NO AMOUNT OF ENERGYCAN MAKE IT SO
 I WANT TO BE GREAT OR NOTHING
 I WONT BE ACOMMONPLACE DAUBER SO I DONT INTEND TO TRY ANY MORE
AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH YOURSELF NOW IF I MAY ASK
POLISH UP MY OTHER TALENTS AND BE AN ORNAMENT TO SOCIETY IF I GET THECHANCE
IT WAS A CHARACTERISTIC SPEECH AND SOUNDED DARING BUT AUDACITY BECOMESYOUNG PEOPLE AND AMYS AMBITION HAD A GOOD FOUNDATION
 LAURIE SMILEDBUT HE LIKED THE SPIRIT WITH WHICH SHE TOOK UP A NEW PURPOSE WHEN ALONGCHERISHED ONE DIED AND SPENT NO TIME LAMENTING
GOOD
 AND HERE IS WHERE FRED VAUGHN COMES IN I FANCY
AMY PRESERVED A DISCREET SILENCE BUT THERE WAS A CONSCIOUS LOOK IN HERDOWNCAST FACE THAT MADE LAURIE SIT UP AND SAY GRAVELYNOW IM GOING TO PLAY BROTHER AND ASK QUESTIONS
 MAY I
I DONT PROMISE TO ANSWER
YOUR FACE WILL IF YOUR TONGUE WONT
 YOU ARENT WOMAN OF THE WORLDENOUGH YET TO HIDE YOUR FEELINGS MY DEAR
 I HEARD RUMORS ABOUT FRED ANDYOU LAST YEAR AND ITS MY PRIVATE OPINION THAT IF HE HAD NOT BEENCALLED HOME SO SUDDENLY AND DETAINED SO LONG SOMETHING WOULD HAVE COMEOF ITHEY
THATS NOT FOR ME TO SAY WAS AMYS PRIM REPLY BUT HER LIPS WOULDSMILE AND THERE WAS A TRAITOROUS SPARKLE OF THE EYE WHICH BETRAYEDTHAT SHE KNEW HER POWER AND ENJOYED THE KNOWLEDGE
YOU ARE NOT ENGAGED I HOPE
 AND LAURIE LOOKED VERY ELDERBROTHERLYAND GRAVE ALL OF A SUDDEN
NO
BUT YOU WILL BE IF HE COMES BACK AND GOES PROPERLY DOWN UPON HISKNEES WONT YOU
VERY LIKELY
THEN YOU ARE FOND OF OLD FRED
I COULD BE IF I TRIED
BUT YOU DONT INTEND TO TRY TILL THE PROPER MOMENT
 BLESS MY SOUL WHATUNEARTHLY PRUDENCE
 HES A GOOD FELLOW AMY BUT NOT THE MAN I FANCIEDYOUD LIKE
HE IS RICH A GENTLEMAN AND HAS DELIGHTFUL MANNERS BEGAN AMY TRYINGTO BE QUITE COOL AND DIGNIFIED BUT FEELING A LITTLE ASHAMED OF HERSELFIN SPITE OF THE SINCERITY OF HER INTENTIONS
I UNDERSTAND QUEENS OF SOCIETY CANT GET ON WITHOUT MONEY SO YOU MEANTO MAKE A GOOD MATCH AND START IN THAT WAY
 QUITE RIGHT AND PROPER ASTHE WORLD GOES BUT IT SOUNDS ODD FROM THE LIPS OF ONE OF YOUR MOTHERSGIRLS
TRUE NEVERTHELESS
A SHORT SPEECH BUT THE QUIET DECISION WITH WHICH IT WAS UTTEREDCONTRASTED CURIOUSLY WITH THE YOUNG SPEAKER
 LAURIE FELT THISINSTINCTIVELY AND LAID HIMSELF DOWN AGAIN WITH A SENSE OFDISAPPOINTMENT WHICH HE COULD NOT EXPLAIN
 HIS LOOK AND SILENCE AS WELLAS A CERTAIN INWARD SELFDISAPPROVAL RUFFLED AMY AND MADE HER RESOLVETO DELIVER HER LECTURE WITHOUT DELAY
I WISH YOUD DO ME THE FAVOR TO ROUSE YOURSELF A LITTLE SHE SAIDSHARPLY
DO IT FOR ME THERES A DEAR GIRL
I COULD IF I TRIED AND SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WOULD LIKE DOING IT INTHE MOST SUMMARY STYLE
TRY THEN I GIVE YOU LEAVE RETURNED LAURIE WHO ENJOYED HAVING SOMEONE TO TEASE AFTER HIS LONG ABSTINENCE FROM HIS FAVORITE PASTIME
YOUD BE ANGRY IN FIVE MINUTES
IM NEVER ANGRY WITH YOU
 IT TAKES TWO FLINTS TO MAKE A FIRE YOU AREAS COOL AND SOFT AS SNOW
YOU DONT KNOW WHAT I CAN DO SNOW PRODUCES A GLOW AND A TINGLE IFAPPLIED RIGHTLY
 YOUR INDIFFERENCE IS HALF AFFECTATION AND A GOODSTIRRING UP WOULD PROVE IT
STIR AWAY IT WONT HURT ME AND IT MAY AMUSE YOU AS THE BIG MAN SAIDWHEN HIS LITTLE WIFE BEAT HIM
 REGARD ME IN THE LIGHT OF A HUSBAND OR ACARPET AND BEAT TILL YOU ARE TIRED IF THAT SORT OF EXERCISE AGREESWITH YOU
BEING DECIDEDLY NETTLED HERSELF AND LONGING TO SEE HIM SHAKE OFF THEAPATHY THAT SO ALTERED HIM AMY SHARPENED BOTH TONGUE AND PENCIL ANDBEGANFLO AND I HAVE GOT A NEW NAME FOR YOU ITS LAZY LAURENCE
 HOW DO YOULIKE IT
SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD ANNOY HIM BUT HE ONLY FOLDED HIS ARMS UNDER HISHEAD WITH AN IMPERTURBABLE THATS NOT BAD
 THANK YOU LADIES
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I HONESTLY THINK OF YOU
PINING TO BE TOLD
WELL I DESPISE YOU
IF SHE HAD EVEN SAID I HATE YOU IN A PETULANT OR COQUETTISH TONE HEWOULD HAVE LAUGHED AND RATHER LIKED IT BUT THE GRAVE ALMOST SADACCENT OF HER VOICE MADE HIM OPEN HIS EYES AND ASK QUICKLYWHY IF YOU PLEASE
BECAUSE WITH EVERY CHANCE FOR BEING GOOD USEFUL AND HAPPY YOU AREFAULTY LAZY AND MISERABLE
STRONG LANGUAGE MADEMOISELLE
IF YOU LIKE IT ILL GO ON
PRAY DO ITS QUITE INTERESTING
I THOUGHT YOUD FIND IT SO SELFISH PEOPLE ALWAYS LIKE TO TALK ABOUTTHEMSELVES
AM I SELFISH
 THE QUESTION SLIPPED OUT INVOLUNTARILY AND IN A TONEOF SURPRISE FOR THE ONE VIRTUE ON WHICH HE PRIDED HIMSELF WASGENEROSITY
YES VERY SELFISH CONTINUED AMY IN A CALM COOL VOICE TWICE ASEFFECTIVE JUST THEN AS AN ANGRY ONE
 ILL SHOW YOU HOW FOR IVESTUDIED YOU WHILE WE HAVE BEEN FROLICKING AND IM NOT AT ALL SATISFIEDWITH YOU
 HERE YOU HAVE BEEN ABROAD NEARLY SIX MONTHS AND DONE NOTHINGBUT WASTE TIME AND MONEY AND DISAPPOINT YOUR FRIENDS
ISNT A FELLOW TO HAVE ANY PLEASURE AFTER A FOURYEARS GRIND
YOU DONT LOOK AS IF YOUD HAD MUCH AT ANY RATE YOU ARE NONE THEBETTER FOR IT AS FAR AS I CAN SEE
 I SAID WHEN WE FIRST MET THAT YOUHAD IMPROVED
 NOW I TAKE IT ALL BACK FOR I DONT THINK YOU HALF SO NICEAS WHEN I LEFT YOU AT HOME
 YOU HAVE GROWN ABOMINABLY LAZY YOU LIKEGOSSIP AND WASTE TIME ON FRIVOLOUS THINGS YOU ARE CONTENTED TO BEPETTED AND ADMIRED BY SILLY PEOPLE INSTEAD OF BEING LOVED AND RESPECTEDBY WISE ONES
 WITH MONEY TALENT POSITION HEALTH AND BEAUTYAH YOULIKE THAT OLD VANITY
 BUT ITS THE TRUTH SO I CANT HELP SAYINGITWITH ALL THESE SPLENDID THINGS TO USE AND ENJOY YOU CAN FINDNOTHING TO DO BUT DAWDLE AND INSTEAD OF BEING THE MAN YOU MIGHT ANDOUGHT TO BE YOU ARE ONLY THERE SHE STOPPED WITH A LOOK THAT HADBOTH PAIN AND PITY IN IT
SAINT LAURENCE ON A GRIDIRON ADDED LAURIE BLANDLY FINISHING THESENTENCE
 BUT THE LECTURE BEGAN TO TAKE EFFECT FOR THERE WAS AWIDEAWAKE SPARKLE IN HIS EYES NOW AND A HALFANGRY HALFINJUREDEXPRESSION REPLACED THE FORMER INDIFFERENCE
I SUPPOSED YOUD TAKE IT SO
 YOU MEN TELL US WE ARE ANGELS AND SAY WECAN MAKE YOU WHAT WE WILL BUT THE INSTANT WE HONESTLY TRY TO DO YOUGOOD YOU LAUGH AT US AND WONT LISTEN WHICH PROVES HOW MUCH YOURFLATTERY IS WORTH
 AMY SPOKE BITTERLY AND TURNED HER BACK ON THEEXASPERATING MARTYR AT HER FEET
IN A MINUTE A HAND CAME DOWN OVER THE PAGE SO THAT SHE COULD NOT DRAWAND LAURIES VOICE SAID WITH A DROLL IMITATION OF A PENITENT CHILDI WILL BE GOOD OH I WILL BE GOOD
BUT AMY DID NOT LAUGH FOR SHE WAS IN EARNEST AND TAPPING ON THEOUTSPREAD HAND WITH HER PENCIL SAID SOBERLYARENT YOU ASHAMED OF A HAND LIKE THAT
 ITS AS SOFT AND WHITE AS AWOMANS AND LOOKS AS IF IT NEVER DID ANYTHING BUT WEAR JOUVINS BESTGLOVES AND PICK FLOWERS FOR LADIES
 YOU ARE NOT A DANDY THANK HEAVEN
SO IM GLAD TO SEE THERE ARE NO DIAMONDS OR BIG SEALRINGS ON IT ONLYTHE LITTLE OLD ONE JO GAVE YOU SO LONG AGO
 DEAR SOUL I WISH SHE WASHERE TO HELP ME
SO DO I
THE HAND VANISHED AS SUDDENLY AS IT CAME AND THERE WAS ENERGY ENOUGH INTHE ECHO OF HER WISH TO SUIT EVEN AMY
 SHE GLANCED DOWN AT HIM WITH ANEW THOUGHT IN HER MIND BUT HE WAS LYING WITH HIS HAT HALF OVER HISFACE AS IF FOR SHADE AND HIS MUSTACHE HID HIS MOUTH
 SHE ONLY SAW HISCHEST RISE AND FALL WITH A LONG BREATH THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SIGH ANDTHE HAND THAT WORE THE RING NESTLED DOWN INTO THE GRASS AS IF TO HIDESOMETHING TOO PRECIOUS OR TOO TENDER TO BE SPOKEN OF
 ALL IN A MINUTEVARIOUS HINTS AND TRIFLES ASSUMED SHAPE AND SIGNIFICANCE IN AMYS MINDAND TOLD HER WHAT HER SISTER NEVER HAD CONFIDED TO HER
 SHE REMEMBEREDTHAT LAURIE NEVER SPOKE VOLUNTARILY OF JO SHE RECALLED THE SHADOW ONHIS FACE JUST NOW THE CHANGE IN HIS CHARACTER AND THE WEARING OF THELITTLE OLD RING WHICH WAS NO ORNAMENT TO A HANDSOME HAND
 GIRLS AREQUICK TO READ SUCH SIGNS AND FEEL THEIR ELOQUENCE
 AMY HAD FANCIED THATPERHAPS A LOVE TROUBLE WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ALTERATION AND NOW SHEWAS SURE OF IT
 HER KEEN EYES FILLED AND WHEN SHE SPOKE AGAIN IT WASIN A VOICE THAT COULD BE BEAUTIFULLY SOFT AND KIND WHEN SHE CHOSE TOMAKE IT SO
I KNOW I HAVE NO RIGHT TO TALK SO TO YOU LAURIE AND IF YOU WERENTTHE SWEETESTTEMPERED FELLOW IN THE WORLD YOUD BE VERY ANGRY WITH ME
BUT WE ARE ALL SO FOND AND PROUD OF YOU I COULDNT BEAR TO THINK THEYSHOULD BE DISAPPOINTED IN YOU AT HOME AS I HAVE BEEN THOUGH PERHAPSTHEY WOULD UNDERSTAND THE CHANGE BETTER THAN I DO
I THINK THEY WOULD CAME FROM UNDER THE HAT IN A GRIM TONE QUITE ASTOUCHING AS A BROKEN ONE
THEY OUGHT TO HAVE TOLD ME AND NOT LET ME GO BLUNDERING AND SCOLDINGWHEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE KIND AND PATIENT THAN EVER
 I NEVER DIDLIKE THAT MISS RANDAL AND NOW I HATE HER
 SAID ARTFUL AMY WISHING TOBE SURE OF HER FACTS THIS TIME
HANG MISS RANDAL
 AND LAURIE KNOCKED THE HAT OFF HIS FACE WITH A LOOKTHAT LEFT NO DOUBT OF HIS SENTIMENTS TOWARD THAT YOUNG LADY
I BEG PARDON I THOUGHT AND THERE SHE PAUSED DIPLOMATICALLY
NO YOU DIDNT YOU KNEW PERFECTLY WELL I NEVER CARED FOR ANY ONE BUTJO
 LAURIE SAID THAT IN HIS OLD IMPETUOUS TONE AND TURNED HIS FACEAWAY AS HE SPOKE
I DID THINK SO BUT AS THEY NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND YOU CAMEAWAY I SUPPOSED I WAS MISTAKEN
 AND JO WOULDNT BE KIND TO YOU
 WHY IWAS SURE SHE LOVED YOU DEARLY
SHE WAS KIND BUT NOT IN THE RIGHT WAY AND ITS LUCKY FOR HER SHEDIDNT LOVE ME IF IM THE GOODFORNOTHING FELLOW YOU THINK ME
 ITSHER FAULT THOUGH AND YOU MAY TELL HER SO
THE HARD BITTER LOOK CAME BACK AGAIN AS HE SAID THAT AND IT TROUBLEDAMY FOR SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT BALM TO APPLY
I WAS WRONG I DIDNT KNOW
 IM VERY SORRY I WAS SO CROSS BUT I CANTHELP WISHING YOUD BEAR IT BETTER TEDDY DEAR
DONT THATS HER NAME FOR ME
 AND LAURIE PUT UP HIS HAND WITH A QUICKGESTURE TO STOP THE WORDS SPOKEN IN JOS HALFKIND HALFREPROACHFULTONE
 WAIT TILL YOUVE TRIED IT YOURSELF HE ADDED IN A LOW VOICE ASHE PULLED UP THE GRASS BY THE HANDFUL
ID TAKE IT MANFULLY AND BE RESPECTED IF I COULDNT BE LOVED SAIDAMY WITH THE DECISION OF ONE WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT
NOW LAURIE FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT HE HAD BORNE IT REMARKABLY WELLMAKING NO MOAN ASKING NO SYMPATHY AND TAKING HIS TROUBLE AWAY TO LIVEIT DOWN ALONE
 AMYS LECTURE PUT THE MATTER IN A NEW LIGHT AND FOR THEFIRST TIME IT DID LOOK WEAK AND SELFISH TO LOSE HEART AT THE FIRSTFAILURE AND SHUT HIMSELF UP IN MOODY INDIFFERENCE
 HE FELT AS IFSUDDENLY SHAKEN OUT OF A PENSIVE DREAM AND FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GO TOSLEEP AGAIN
 PRESENTLY HE SAT UP AND ASKED SLOWLYDO YOU THINK JO WOULD DESPISE ME AS YOU DO
YES IF SHE SAW YOU NOW
 SHE HATES LAZY PEOPLE
 WHY DONT YOU DOSOMETHING SPLENDID AND MAKE HER LOVE YOU
I DID MY BEST BUT IT WAS NO USE
GRADUATING WELL YOU MEAN
 THAT WAS NO MORE THAN YOU OUGHT TO HAVEDONE FOR YOUR GRANDFATHERS SAKE
 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SHAMEFUL TO FAILAFTER SPENDING SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY WHEN EVERY ONE KNEW YOU COULDDO WELL
I DID FAIL SAY WHAT YOU WILL FOR JO WOULDNT LOVE ME BEGAN LAURIELEANING HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND IN A DESPONDENT ATTITUDE
NO YOU DIDNT AND YOULL SAY SO IN THE END FOR IT DID YOU GOOD ANDPROVED THAT YOU COULD DO SOMETHING IF YOU TRIED
 IF YOUD ONLY SET ABOUTANOTHER TASK OF SOME SORT YOUD SOON BE YOUR HEARTY HAPPY SELF AGAINAND FORGET YOUR TROUBLE
THATS IMPOSSIBLE
TRY IT AND SEE
 YOU NEEDNT SHRUG YOUR SHOULDERS AND THINK MUCH SHEKNOWS ABOUT SUCH THINGS
 I DONT PRETEND TO BE WISE BUT I AMOBSERVING AND I SEE A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN YOUD IMAGINE
 IMINTERESTED IN OTHER PEOPLES EXPERIENCES AND INCONSISTENCIES ANDTHOUGH I CANT EXPLAIN I REMEMBER AND USE THEM FOR MY OWN BENEFIT
 LOVEJO ALL YOUR DAYS IF YOU CHOOSE BUT DONT LET IT SPOIL YOU FOR ITSWICKED TO THROW AWAY SO MANY GOOD GIFTS BECAUSE YOU CANT HAVE THE ONEYOU WANT
 THERE I WONT LECTURE ANY MORE FOR I KNOW YOULL WAKE UP ANDBE A MAN IN SPITE OF THAT HARDHEARTED GIRL
NEITHER SPOKE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES
 LAURIE SAT TURNING THE LITTLE RING ONHIS FINGER AND AMY PUT THE LAST TOUCHES TO THE HASTY SKETCH SHE HADBEEN WORKING AT WHILE SHE TALKED
 PRESENTLY SHE PUT IT ON HIS KNEEMERELY SAYINGHOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
HE LOOKED AND THEN HE SMILED AS HE COULD NOT WELL HELP DOING FOR ITWAS CAPITALLY DONETHE LONG LAZY FIGURE ON THE GRASS WITH LISTLESSFACE HALFSHUT EYES AND ONE HAND HOLDING A CIGAR FROM WHICH CAME THELITTLE WREATH OF SMOKE THAT ENCIRCLED THE DREAMERS HEAD
HOW WELL YOU DRAW
 HE SAID WITH GENUINE SURPRISE AND PLEASURE AT HERSKILL ADDING WITH A HALFLAUGHYES THATS ME
AS YOU ARE THIS IS AS YOU WERE AND AMY LAID ANOTHER SKETCH BESIDETHE ONE HE HELD
IT WAS NOT NEARLY SO WELL DONE BUT THERE WAS A LIFE AND SPIRIT IN ITWHICH ATONED FOR MANY FAULTS AND IT RECALLED THE PAST SO VIVIDLY THAT ASUDDEN CHANGE SWEPT OVER THE YOUNG MANS FACE AS HE LOOKED
 ONLY A ROUGHSKETCH OF LAURIE TAMING A HORSE HAT AND COAT WERE OFF AND EVERY LINEOF THE ACTIVE FIGURE RESOLUTE FACE AND COMMANDING ATTITUDE WAS FULLOF ENERGY AND MEANING
 THE HANDSOME BRUTE JUST SUBDUED STOOD ARCHINGHIS NECK UNDER THE TIGHTLY DRAWN REIN WITH ONE FOOT IMPATIENTLY PAWINGTHE GROUND AND EARS PRICKED UP AS IF LISTENING FOR THE VOICE THAT HADMASTERED HIM
 IN THE RUFFLED MANE THE RIDERS BREEZY HAIR AND ERECTATTITUDE THERE WAS A SUGGESTION OF SUDDENLY ARRESTED MOTION OFSTRENGTH COURAGE AND YOUTHFUL BUOYANCY THAT CONTRASTED SHARPLY WITHTHE SUPINE GRACE OF THE DOLCE FAR NIENTE SKETCH
 LAURIE SAIDNOTHING BUT AS HIS EYE WENT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AMY SAW HIM FLUSHUP AND FOLD HIS LIPS TOGETHER AS IF HE READ AND ACCEPTED THE LITTLELESSON SHE HAD GIVEN HIM
 THAT SATISFIED HER AND WITHOUT WAITING FORHIM TO SPEAK SHE SAID IN HER SPRIGHTLY WAY        ILLUSTRATION A ROUGH SKETCH OF LAURIE TAMING A HORSEDONT YOU REMEMBER THE DAY YOU PLAYED RAREY WITH PUCK AND WE ALLLOOKED ON
 MEG AND BETH WERE FRIGHTENED BUT JO CLAPPED AND PRANCED ANDI SAT ON THE FENCE AND DREW YOU

 YOUVE IMPROVED IMMENSELY SINCE THEN AND I CONGRATULATEYOU
 MAY I VENTURE TO SUGGEST IN A HONEYMOON PARADISE THAT FIVEOCLOCK IS THE DINNERHOUR AT YOUR HOTEL
LAURIE ROSE AS HE SPOKE RETURNED THE PICTURES WITH A SMILE AND A BOWAND LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AS IF TO REMIND HER THAT EVEN MORAL LECTURESSHOULD HAVE AN END
 HE TRIED TO RESUME HIS FORMER EASY INDIFFERENT AIRBUT IT WAS AN AFFECTATION NOW FOR THE ROUSING HAD BEEN MOREEFFICACIOUS THAN HE WOULD CONFESS
 AMY FELT THE SHADE OF COLDNESS IN HISMANNER AND SAID TO HERSELFNOW IVE OFFENDED HIM
 WELL IF IT DOES HIM GOOD IM GLAD IF IT MAKESHIM HATE ME IM SORRY BUT ITS TRUE AND I CANT TAKE BACK A WORD OFIT
THEY LAUGHED AND CHATTED ALL THE WAY HOME AND LITTLE BAPTISTE UPBEHIND THOUGHT THAT MONSIEUR AND MADEMOISELLE WERE IN CHARMING SPIRITS
BUT BOTH FELT ILL AT EASE THE FRIENDLY FRANKNESS WAS DISTURBED THESUNSHINE HAD A SHADOW OVER IT AND DESPITE THEIR APPARENT GAYETY THEREWAS A SECRET DISCONTENT IN THE HEART OF EACH
SHALL WE SEE YOU THIS EVENING MON FRÈRE
 ASKED AMY AS THEY PARTEDAT HER AUNTS DOOR

GOOD BOY
 IM GLAD HES GONE SAID AMY WITH AN APPROVING SMILE THENEXT MINUTE HER FACE FELL AS SHE GLANCED ABOUT THE EMPTY ROOM ADDINGWITH AN INVOLUNTARY SIGHYES I AM GLAD BUT HOW I SHALL MISS HIM
                ILLUSTRATION THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW                                  XL
                       THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW
WHEN THE FIRST BITTERNESS WAS OVER THE FAMILY ACCEPTED THE INEVITABLEAND TRIED TO BEAR IT CHEERFULLY HELPING ONE ANOTHER BY THE INCREASEDAFFECTION WHICH COMES TO BIND HOUSEHOLDS TENDERLY TOGETHER IN TIMES OFTROUBLE
 THEY PUT AWAY THEIR GRIEF AND EACH DID HIS OR HER PART TOWARDMAKING THAT LAST YEAR A HAPPY ONE
THE PLEASANTEST ROOM IN THE HOUSE WAS SET APART FOR BETH AND IN IT WASGATHERED EVERYTHING THAT SHE MOST LOVEDFLOWERS PICTURES HER PIANOTHE LITTLE WORKTABLE AND THE BELOVED PUSSIES
 FATHERS BEST BOOKSFOUND THEIR WAY THERE MOTHERS EASYCHAIR JOS DESK AMYS FINESTSKETCHES AND EVERY DAY MEG BROUGHT HER BABIES ON A LOVING PILGRIMAGETO MAKE SUNSHINE FOR AUNTY BETH
 JOHN QUIETLY SET APART A LITTLE SUMTHAT HE MIGHT ENJOY THE PLEASURE OF KEEPING THE INVALID SUPPLIED WITHTHE FRUIT SHE LOVED AND LONGED FOR OLD HANNAH NEVER WEARIED OFCONCOCTING DAINTY DISHES TO TEMPT A CAPRICIOUS APPETITE DROPPING TEARSAS SHE WORKED AND FROM ACROSS THE SEA CAME LITTLE GIFTS AND CHEERFULLETTERS SEEMING TO BRING BREATHS OF WARMTH AND FRAGRANCE FROM LANDSTHAT KNOW NO WINTER
HERE CHERISHED LIKE A HOUSEHOLD SAINT IN ITS SHRINE SAT BETH TRANQUILAND BUSY AS EVER FOR NOTHING COULD CHANGE THE SWEET UNSELFISH NATUREAND EVEN WHILE PREPARING TO LEAVE LIFE SHE TRIED TO MAKE IT HAPPIER FORTHOSE WHO SHOULD REMAIN BEHIND
 THE FEEBLE FINGERS WERE NEVER IDLE ANDONE OF HER PLEASURES WAS TO MAKE LITTLE THINGS FOR THE SCHOOLCHILDRENDAILY PASSING TO AND FROTO DROP A PAIR OF MITTENS FROM HER WINDOW FORA PAIR OF PURPLE HANDS A NEEDLEBOOK FOR SOME SMALL MOTHER OF MANYDOLLS PENWIPERS FOR YOUNG PENMEN TOILING THROUGH FORESTS OF POTHOOKSSCRAPBOOKS FOR PICTURELOVING EYES AND ALL MANNER OF PLEASANT DEVICESTILL THE RELUCTANT CLIMBERS UP THE LADDER OF LEARNING FOUND THEIR WAYSTREWN WITH FLOWERS AS IT WERE AND CAME TO REGARD THE GENTLE GIVER ASA SORT OF FAIRY GODMOTHER WHO SAT ABOVE THERE AND SHOWERED DOWN GIFTSMIRACULOUSLY SUITED TO THEIR TASTES AND NEEDS
 IF BETH HAD WANTED ANYREWARD SHE FOUND IT IN THE BRIGHT LITTLE FACES ALWAYS TURNED UP TO HERWINDOW WITH NODS AND SMILES AND THE DROLL LITTLE LETTERS WHICH CAME TOHER FULL OF BLOTS AND GRATITUDE
THE FIRST FEW MONTHS WERE VERY HAPPY ONES AND BETH OFTEN USED TO LOOKROUND AND SAY HOW BEAUTIFUL THIS IS
 AS THEY ALL SAT TOGETHER IN HERSUNNY ROOM THE BABIES KICKING AND CROWING ON THE FLOOR MOTHER ANDSISTERS WORKING NEAR AND FATHER READING IN HIS PLEASANT VOICE FROMTHE WISE OLD BOOKS WHICH SEEMED RICH IN GOOD AND COMFORTABLE WORDS ASAPPLICABLE NOW AS WHEN WRITTEN CENTURIES AGO A LITTLE CHAPEL WHERE APATERNAL PRIEST TAUGHT HIS FLOCK THE HARD LESSONS ALL MUST LEARN TRYINGTO SHOW THEM THAT HOPE CAN COMFORT LOVE AND FAITH MAKE RESIGNATIONPOSSIBLE
 SIMPLE SERMONS THAT WENT STRAIGHT TO THE SOULS OF THOSE WHOLISTENED FOR THE FATHERS HEART WAS IN THE MINISTERS RELIGION AND THEFREQUENT FALTER IN THE VOICE GAVE A DOUBLE ELOQUENCE TO THE WORDS HESPOKE OR READ
IT WAS WELL FOR ALL THAT THIS PEACEFUL TIME WAS GIVEN THEM ASPREPARATION FOR THE SAD HOURS TO COME FOR BY AND BY BETH SAID THENEEDLE WAS SO HEAVY AND PUT IT DOWN FOREVER TALKING WEARIED HERFACES TROUBLED HER PAIN CLAIMED HER FOR ITS OWN AND HER TRANQUILSPIRIT WAS SORROWFULLY PERTURBED BY THE ILLS THAT VEXED HER FEEBLEFLESH
 AH ME
 SUCH HEAVY DAYS SUCH LONG LONG NIGHTS SUCH ACHINGHEARTS AND IMPLORING PRAYERS WHEN THOSE WHO LOVED HER BEST WERE FORCEDTO SEE THE THIN HANDS STRETCHED OUT TO THEM BESEECHINGLY TO HEAR THEBITTER CRY HELP ME HELP ME
 AND TO FEEL THAT THERE WAS NO HELP
 ASAD ECLIPSE OF THE SERENE SOUL A SHARP STRUGGLE OF THE YOUNG LIFE WITHDEATH BUT BOTH WERE MERCIFULLY BRIEF AND THEN THE NATURAL REBELLIONOVER THE OLD PEACE RETURNED MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER
 WITH THE WRECK OFHER FRAIL BODY BETHS SOUL GREW STRONG AND THOUGH SHE SAID LITTLETHOSE ABOUT HER FELT THAT SHE WAS READY SAW THAT THE FIRST PILGRIMCALLED WAS LIKEWISE THE FITTEST AND WAITED WITH HER ON THE SHORETRYING TO SEE THE SHINING ONES COMING TO RECEIVE HER WHEN SHE CROSSEDTHE RIVER
JO NEVER LEFT HER FOR AN HOUR SINCE BETH HAD SAID I FEEL STRONGER WHENYOU ARE HERE
 SHE SLEPT ON A COUCH IN THE ROOM WAKING OFTEN TO RENEWTHE FIRE TO FEED LIFT OR WAIT UPON THE PATIENT CREATURE WHO SELDOMASKED FOR ANYTHING AND TRIED NOT TO BE A TROUBLE
 ALL DAY SHE HAUNTEDTHE ROOM JEALOUS OF ANY OTHER NURSE AND PROUDER OF BEING CHOSEN THENTHAN OF ANY HONOR HER LIFE EVER BROUGHT HER
 PRECIOUS AND HELPFUL HOURSTO JO FOR NOW HER HEART RECEIVED THE TEACHING THAT IT NEEDED LESSONSIN PATIENCE WERE SO SWEETLY TAUGHT HER THAT SHE COULD NOT FAIL TO LEARNTHEM CHARITY FOR ALL THE LOVELY SPIRIT THAT CAN FORGIVE AND TRULYFORGET UNKINDNESS THE LOYALTY TO DUTY THAT MAKES THE HARDEST EASY ANDTHE SINCERE FAITH THAT FEARS NOTHING BUT TRUSTS UNDOUBTINGLY
OFTEN WHEN SHE WOKE JO FOUND BETH READING IN HER WELLWORN LITTLEBOOK HEARD HER SINGING SOFTLY TO BEGUILE THE SLEEPLESS NIGHT OR SAWHER LEAN HER FACE UPON HER HANDS WHILE SLOW TEARS DROPPED THROUGH THETRANSPARENT FINGERS AND JO WOULD LIE WATCHING HER WITH THOUGHTS TOODEEP FOR TEARS FEELING THAT BETH IN HER SIMPLE UNSELFISH WAY WASTRYING TO WEAN HERSELF FROM THE DEAR OLD LIFE AND FIT HERSELF FOR THELIFE TO COME BY SACRED WORDS OF COMFORT QUIET PRAYERS AND THE MUSICSHE LOVED SO WELL
SEEING THIS DID MORE FOR JO THAN THE WISEST SERMONS THE SAINTLIESTHYMNS THE MOST FERVENT PRAYERS THAT ANY VOICE COULD UTTER FOR WITHEYES MADE CLEAR BY MANY TEARS AND A HEART SOFTENED BY THE TENDERESTSORROW SHE RECOGNIZED THE BEAUTY OF HER SISTERS LIFEUNEVENTFULUNAMBITIOUS YET FULL OF THE GENUINE VIRTUES WHICH SMELL SWEET ANDBLOSSOM IN THE DUST THE SELFFORGETFULNESS THAT MAKES THE HUMBLEST ONEARTH REMEMBERED SOONEST IN HEAVEN THE TRUE SUCCESS WHICH IS POSSIBLETO ALL
ONE NIGHT WHEN BETH LOOKED AMONG THE BOOKS UPON HER TABLE TO FINDSOMETHING TO MAKE HER FORGET THE MORTAL WEARINESS THAT WAS ALMOST ASHARD TO BEAR AS PAIN AS SHE TURNED THE LEAVES OF HER OLD FAVORITEPILGRIMS PROGRESS SHE FOUND A LITTLE PAPER SCRIBBLED OVER IN JOSHAND
 THE NAME CAUGHT HER EYE AND THE BLURRED LOOK OF THE LINES MADEHER SURE THAT TEARS HAD FALLEN ON IT

         EARTHLY JOYS AND HOPES AND SORROWS           BREAK LIKE RIPPLES ON THE STRAND         OF THE DEEP AND SOLEMN RIVER           WHERE HER WILLING FEET NOW STAND

BLURRED AND BLOTTED FAULTY AND FEEBLE AS THE LINES WERE THEY BROUGHTA LOOK OF INEXPRESSIBLE COMFORT TO BETHS FACE FOR HER ONE REGRET HADBEEN THAT SHE HAD DONE SO LITTLE AND THIS SEEMED TO ASSURE HER THAT HERLIFE HAD NOT BEEN USELESS THAT HER DEATH WOULD NOT BRING THE DESPAIRSHE FEARED
 AS SHE SAT WITH THE PAPER FOLDED BETWEEN HER HANDS THECHARRED LOG FELL ASUNDER
 JO STARTED UP REVIVED THE BLAZE AND CREPT TOTHE BEDSIDE HOPING BETH SLEPT
NOT ASLEEP BUT SO HAPPY DEAR

 HAVE I BEEN ALL THAT TO YOU JO
 SHE ASKED WITHWISTFUL HUMBLE EARNESTNESS

ILL TRY BETH AND THEN AND THERE JO RENOUNCED HER OLD AMBITIONPLEDGED HERSELF TO A NEW AND BETTER ONE ACKNOWLEDGING THE POVERTY OFOTHER DESIRES AND FEELING THE BLESSED SOLACE OF A BELIEF IN THEIMMORTALITY OF LOVE
SO THE SPRING DAYS CAME AND WENT THE SKY GREW CLEARER THE EARTHGREENER THE FLOWERS WERE UP FAIR AND EARLY AND THE BIRDS CAME BACK INTIME TO SAY GOODBY TO BETH WHO LIKE A TIRED BUT TRUSTFUL CHILD CLUNGTO THE HANDS THAT HAD LED HER ALL HER LIFE AS FATHER AND MOTHER GUIDEDHER TENDERLY THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW AND GAVE HER UP TO GOD
SELDOM EXCEPT IN BOOKS DO THE DYING UTTER MEMORABLE WORDS SEEVISIONS OR DEPART WITH BEATIFIED COUNTENANCES AND THOSE WHO HAVE SPEDMANY PARTING SOULS KNOW THAT TO MOST THE END COMES AS NATURALLY ANDSIMPLY AS SLEEP
 AS BETH HAD HOPED THE TIDE WENT OUT EASILY AND INTHE DARK HOUR BEFORE THE DAWN ON THE BOSOM WHERE SHE HAD DRAWN HERFIRST BREATH SHE QUIETLY DREW HER LAST WITH NO FAREWELL BUT ONE LOVINGLOOK ONE LITTLE SIGH
WITH TEARS AND PRAYERS AND TENDER HANDS MOTHER AND SISTERS MADE HERREADY FOR THE LONG SLEEP THAT PAIN WOULD NEVER MAR AGAIN SEEING WITHGRATEFUL EYES THE BEAUTIFUL SERENITY THAT SOON REPLACED THE PATHETICPATIENCE THAT HAD WRUNG THEIR HEARTS SO LONG AND FEELING WITH REVERENTJOY THAT TO THEIR DARLING DEATH WAS A BENIGNANT ANGEL NOT A PHANTOMFULL OF DREAD
WHEN MORNING CAME FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY MONTHS THE FIRE WAS OUTJOS PLACE WAS EMPTY AND THE ROOM WAS VERY STILL
 BUT A BIRD SANGBLITHELY ON A BUDDING BOUGH CLOSE BY THE SNOWDROPS BLOSSOMED FRESHLYAT THE WINDOW AND THE SPRING SUNSHINE STREAMED IN LIKE A BENEDICTIONOVER THE PLACID FACE UPON THE PILLOWA FACE SO FULL OF PAINLESS PEACETHAT THOSE WHO LOVED IT BEST SMILED THROUGH THEIR TEARS AND THANKED GODTHAT BETH WAS WELL AT LAST
                       ILLUSTRATION TAILPIECE                ILLUSTRATION SAT STARING UP AT THE BUSTS                                  XLI
                          LEARNING TO FORGET
AMYS LECTURE DID LAURIE GOOD THOUGH OF COURSE HE DID NOT OWN IT TILLLONG AFTERWARD MEN SELDOM DO FOR WHEN WOMEN ARE THE ADVISERS THELORDS OF CREATION DONT TAKE THE ADVICE TILL THEY HAVE PERSUADEDTHEMSELVES THAT IT IS JUST WHAT THEY INTENDED TO DO THEN THEY ACT UPONIT AND IF IT SUCCEEDS THEY GIVE THE WEAKER VESSEL HALF THE CREDIT OFIT IF IT FAILS THEY GENEROUSLY GIVE HER THE WHOLE
 LAURIE WENT BACK TOHIS GRANDFATHER AND WAS SO DUTIFULLY DEVOTED FOR SEVERAL WEEKS THAT THEOLD GENTLEMAN DECLARED THE CLIMATE OF NICE HAD IMPROVED HIM WONDERFULLYAND HE HAD BETTER TRY IT AGAIN
 THERE WAS NOTHING THE YOUNG GENTLEMANWOULD HAVE LIKED BETTER BUT ELEPHANTS COULD NOT HAVE DRAGGED HIM BACKAFTER THE SCOLDING HE HAD RECEIVED PRIDE FORBID AND WHENEVER THELONGING GREW VERY STRONG HE FORTIFIED HIS RESOLUTION BY REPEATING THEWORDS THAT HAD MADE THE DEEPEST IMPRESSION I DESPISE YOU GO AND DOSOMETHING SPLENDID THAT WILL MAKE HER LOVE YOU
LAURIE TURNED THE MATTER OVER IN HIS MIND SO OFTEN THAT HE SOON BROUGHTHIMSELF TO CONFESS THAT HE HAD BEEN SELFISH AND LAZY BUT THEN WHEN AMAN HAS A GREAT SORROW HE SHOULD BE INDULGED IN ALL SORTS OF VAGARIESTILL HE HAS LIVED IT DOWN
 HE FELT THAT HIS BLIGHTED AFFECTIONS WEREQUITE DEAD NOW AND THOUGH HE SHOULD NEVER CEASE TO BE A FAITHFULMOURNER THERE WAS NO OCCASION TO WEAR HIS WEEDS OSTENTATIOUSLY
 JOWOULDNT LOVE HIM BUT HE MIGHT MAKE HER RESPECT AND ADMIRE HIM BYDOING SOMETHING WHICH SHOULD PROVE THAT A GIRLS NO HAD NOT SPOILT HISLIFE
 HE HAD ALWAYS MEANT TO DO SOMETHING AND AMYS ADVICE WAS QUITEUNNECESSARY
 HE HAD ONLY BEEN WAITING TILL THE AFORESAID BLIGHTEDAFFECTIONS WERE DECENTLY INTERRED THAT BEING DONE HE FELT THAT HE WASREADY TO HIDE HIS STRICKEN HEART AND STILL TOIL ON
AS GOETHE WHEN HE HAD A JOY OR A GRIEF PUT IT INTO A SONG SO LAURIERESOLVED TO EMBALM HIS LOVESORROW IN MUSIC AND COMPOSE A REQUIEM WHICHSHOULD HARROW UP JOS SOUL AND MELT THE HEART OF EVERY HEARER
 THEREFORETHE NEXT TIME THE OLD GENTLEMAN FOUND HIM GETTING RESTLESS AND MOODYAND ORDERED HIM OFF HE WENT TO VIENNA WHERE HE HAD MUSICAL FRIENDSAND FELL TO WORK WITH THE FIRM DETERMINATION TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF
BUT WHETHER THE SORROW WAS TOO VAST TO BE EMBODIED IN MUSIC OR MUSICTOO ETHEREAL TO UPLIFT A MORTAL WOE HE SOON DISCOVERED THAT THE REQUIEMWAS BEYOND HIM JUST AT PRESENT
 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HIS MIND WAS NOT INWORKING ORDER YET AND HIS IDEAS NEEDED CLARIFYING FOR OFTEN IN THEMIDDLE OF A PLAINTIVE STRAIN HE WOULD FIND HIMSELF HUMMING A DANCINGTUNE THAT VIVIDLY RECALLED THE CHRISTMAS BALL AT NICE ESPECIALLY THESTOUT FRENCHMAN AND PUT AN EFFECTUAL STOP TO TRAGIC COMPOSITION FOR THETIME BEING
THEN HE TRIED AN OPERA FOR NOTHING SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE IN THE BEGINNINGBUT HERE AGAIN UNFORESEEN DIFFICULTIES BESET HIM
 HE WANTED JO FOR HISHEROINE AND CALLED UPON HIS MEMORY TO SUPPLY HIM WITH TENDERRECOLLECTIONS AND ROMANTIC VISIONS OF HIS LOVE
 BUT MEMORY TURNEDTRAITOR AND AS IF POSSESSED BY THE PERVERSE SPIRIT OF THE GIRL WOULDONLY RECALL JOS ODDITIES FAULTS AND FREAKS WOULD ONLY SHOW HER INTHE MOST UNSENTIMENTAL ASPECTSBEATING MATS WITH HER HEAD TIED UP INA BANDANNA BARRICADING HERSELF WITH THE SOFAPILLOW OR THROWING COLDWATER OVER HIS PASSION À LA GUMMIDGEAND AN IRRESISTIBLE LAUGHSPOILT THE PENSIVE PICTURE HE WAS ENDEAVORING TO PAINT
 JO WOULDNT BEPUT INTO THE OPERA AT ANY PRICE AND HE HAD TO GIVE HER UP WITH A BLESSTHAT GIRL WHAT A TORMENT SHE IS
 AND A CLUTCH AT HIS HAIR AS BECAME ADISTRACTED COMPOSER
WHEN HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM FOR ANOTHER AND A LESS INTRACTABLE DAMSEL TOIMMORTALIZE IN MELODY MEMORY PRODUCED ONE WITH THE MOST OBLIGINGREADINESS
 THIS PHANTOM WORE MANY FACES BUT IT ALWAYS HAD GOLDEN HAIRWAS ENVELOPED IN A DIAPHANOUS CLOUD AND FLOATED AIRILY BEFORE HISMINDS EYE IN A PLEASING CHAOS OF ROSES PEACOCKS WHITE PONIES ANDBLUE RIBBONS
 HE DID NOT GIVE THE COMPLACENT WRAITH ANY NAME BUT HETOOK HER FOR HIS HEROINE AND GREW QUITE FOND OF HER AS WELL HE MIGHTFOR HE GIFTED HER WITH EVERY GIFT AND GRACE UNDER THE SUN AND ESCORTEDHER UNSCATHED THROUGH TRIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ANNIHILATED ANY MORTALWOMAN
THANKS TO THIS INSPIRATION HE GOT ON SWIMMINGLY FOR A TIME BUTGRADUALLY THE WORK LOST ITS CHARM AND HE FORGOT TO COMPOSE WHILE HESAT MUSING PEN IN HAND OR ROAMED ABOUT THE GAY CITY TO GET NEW IDEASAND REFRESH HIS MIND WHICH SEEMED TO BE IN A SOMEWHAT UNSETTLED STATETHAT WINTER
 HE DID NOT DO MUCH BUT HE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL AND WASCONSCIOUS OF A CHANGE OF SOME SORT GOING ON IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
 ITSGENIUS SIMMERING PERHAPS
 ILL LET IT SIMMER AND SEE WHAT COMES OFIT HE SAID WITH A SECRET SUSPICION ALL THE WHILE THAT IT WASNTGENIUS BUT SOMETHING FAR MORE COMMON
 WHATEVER IT WAS IT SIMMERED TOSOME PURPOSE FOR HE GREW MORE AND MORE DISCONTENTED WITH HIS DESULTORYLIFE BEGAN TO LONG FOR SOME REAL AND EARNEST WORK TO GO AT SOUL ANDBODY AND FINALLY CAME TO THE WISE CONCLUSION THAT EVERY ONE WHO LOVEDMUSIC WAS NOT A COMPOSER
 RETURNING FROM ONE OF MOZARTS GRAND OPERASSPLENDIDLY PERFORMED AT THE ROYAL THEATRE HE LOOKED OVER HIS OWNPLAYED A FEW OF THE BEST PARTS SAT STARING UP AT THE BUSTS OFMENDELSSOHN BEETHOVEN AND BACH WHO STARED BENIGNLY BACK AGAIN THENSUDDENLY HE TORE UP HIS MUSICSHEETS ONE BY ONE AND AS THE LASTFLUTTERED OUT OF HIS HAND HE SAID SOBERLY TO HIMSELFSHE IS RIGHT
 TALENT ISNT GENIUS AND YOU CANT MAKE IT SO
 THATMUSIC HAS TAKEN THE VANITY OUT OF ME AS ROME TOOK IT OUT OF HER AND IWONT BE A HUMBUG ANY LONGER
 NOW WHAT SHALL I DO
THAT SEEMED A HARD QUESTION TO ANSWER AND LAURIE BEGAN TO WISH HE HADTO WORK FOR HIS DAILY BREAD
 NOW IF EVER OCCURRED AN ELIGIBLEOPPORTUNITY FOR GOING TO THE DEVIL AS HE ONCE FORCIBLY EXPRESSED ITFOR HE HAD PLENTY OF MONEY AND NOTHING TO DO AND SATAN IS PROVERBIALLYFOND OF PROVIDING EMPLOYMENT FOR FULL AND IDLE HANDS
 THE POOR FELLOWHAD TEMPTATIONS ENOUGH FROM WITHOUT AND FROM WITHIN BUT HE WITHSTOODTHEM PRETTY WELL FOR MUCH AS HE VALUED LIBERTY HE VALUED GOOD FAITHAND CONFIDENCE MORE SO HIS PROMISE TO HIS GRANDFATHER AND HIS DESIRETO BE ABLE TO LOOK HONESTLY INTO THE EYES OF THE WOMEN WHO LOVED HIMAND SAY ALLS WELL KEPT HIM SAFE AND STEADY
VERY LIKELY SOME MRS
 GRUNDY WILL OBSERVE I DONT BELIEVE IT BOYSWILL BE BOYS YOUNG MEN MUST SOW THEIR WILD OATS AND WOMEN MUST NOTEXPECT MIRACLES
 I DARE SAY YOU DONT MRS
 GRUNDY BUT ITS TRUENEVERTHELESS
 WOMEN WORK A GOOD MANY MIRACLES AND I HAVE A PERSUASIONTHAT THEY MAY PERFORM EVEN THAT OF RAISING THE STANDARD OF MANHOOD BYREFUSING TO ECHO SUCH SAYINGS
 LET THE BOYS BE BOYS THE LONGER THEBETTER AND LET THE YOUNG MEN SOW THEIR WILD OATS IF THEY MUST BUTMOTHERS SISTERS AND FRIENDS MAY HELP TO MAKE THE CROP A SMALL ONE ANDKEEP MANY TARES FROM SPOILING THE HARVEST BY BELIEVING AND SHOWINGTHAT THEY BELIEVE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF LOYALTY TO THE VIRTUES WHICHMAKE MEN MANLIEST IN GOOD WOMENS EYES
 IF IT IS A FEMININE DELUSIONLEAVE US TO ENJOY IT WHILE WE MAY FOR WITHOUT IT HALF THE BEAUTY ANDTHE ROMANCE OF LIFE IS LOST AND SORROWFUL FOREBODINGS WOULD EMBITTERALL OUR HOPES OF THE BRAVE TENDERHEARTED LITTLE LADS WHO STILL LOVETHEIR MOTHERS BETTER THAN THEMSELVES AND ARE NOT ASHAMED TO OWN IT
LAURIE THOUGHT THAT THE TASK OF FORGETTING HIS LOVE FOR JO WOULD ABSORBALL HIS POWERS FOR YEARS BUT TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE HE DISCOVERED ITGREW EASIER EVERY DAY
 HE REFUSED TO BELIEVE IT AT FIRST GOT ANGRY WITHHIMSELF AND COULDNT UNDERSTAND IT BUT THESE HEARTS OF OURS ARECURIOUS AND CONTRARY THINGS AND TIME AND NATURE WORK THEIR WILL INSPITE OF US
 LAURIES HEART WOULDNT ACHE THE WOUND PERSISTED INHEALING WITH A RAPIDITY THAT ASTONISHED HIM AND INSTEAD OF TRYING TOFORGET HE FOUND HIMSELF TRYING TO REMEMBER
 HE HAD NOT FORESEEN THISTURN OF AFFAIRS AND WAS NOT PREPARED FOR IT
 HE WAS DISGUSTED WITHHIMSELF SURPRISED AT HIS OWN FICKLENESS AND FULL OF A QUEER MIXTURE OFDISAPPOINTMENT AND RELIEF THAT HE COULD RECOVER FROM SUCH A TREMENDOUSBLOW SO SOON
 HE CAREFULLY STIRRED UP THE EMBERS OF HIS LOST LOVE BUTTHEY REFUSED TO BURST INTO A BLAZE THERE WAS ONLY A COMFORTABLE GLOWTHAT WARMED AND DID HIM GOOD WITHOUT PUTTING HIM INTO A FEVER AND HEWAS RELUCTANTLY OBLIGED TO CONFESS THAT THE BOYISH PASSION WAS SLOWLYSUBSIDING INTO A MORE TRANQUIL SENTIMENT VERY TENDER A LITTLE SAD ANDRESENTFUL STILL BUT THAT WAS SURE TO PASS AWAY IN TIME LEAVING ABROTHERLY AFFECTION WHICH WOULD LAST UNBROKEN TO THE END
AS THE WORD BROTHERLY PASSED THROUGH HIS MIND IN ONE OF THESEREVERIES HE SMILED AND GLANCED UP AT THE PICTURE OF MOZART THAT WASBEFORE HIMWELL HE WAS A GREAT MAN AND WHEN HE COULDNT HAVE ONE SISTER HE TOOKTHE OTHER AND WAS HAPPY
LAURIE DID NOT UTTER THE WORDS BUT HE THOUGHT THEM AND THE NEXTINSTANT KISSED THE LITTLE OLD RING SAYING TO HIMSELFNO I WONT
 I HAVENT FORGOTTEN I NEVER CAN
 ILL TRY AGAIN AND IFTHAT FAILS WHY THENLEAVING HIS SENTENCE UNFINISHED HE SEIZED PEN AND PAPER AND WROTE TOJO TELLING HER THAT HE COULD NOT SETTLE TO ANYTHING WHILE THERE WAS THELEAST HOPE OF HER CHANGING HER MIND
 COULDNT SHE WOULDNT SHE AND LETHIM COME HOME AND BE HAPPY
 WHILE WAITING FOR AN ANSWER HE DID NOTHINGBUT HE DID IT ENERGETICALLY FOR HE WAS IN A FEVER OF IMPATIENCE
 ITCAME AT LAST AND SETTLED HIS MIND EFFECTUALLY ON ONE POINT FOR JODECIDEDLY COULDNT AND WOULDNT
 SHE WAS WRAPPED UP IN BETH AND NEVERWISHED TO HEAR THE WORD LOVE AGAIN
 THEN SHE BEGGED HIM TO BE HAPPYWITH SOMEBODY ELSE BUT ALWAYS TO KEEP A LITTLE CORNER OF HIS HEART FORHIS LOVING SISTER JO
 IN A POSTSCRIPT SHE DESIRED HIM NOT TO TELL AMYTHAT BETH WAS WORSE SHE WAS COMING HOME IN THE SPRING AND THERE WAS NONEED OF SADDENING THE REMAINDER OF HER STAY
 THAT WOULD BE TIME ENOUGHPLEASE GOD BUT LAURIE MUST WRITE TO HER OFTEN AND NOT LET HER FEELLONELY HOMESICK OR ANXIOUS
SO I WILL AT ONCE
 POOR LITTLE GIRL IT WILL BE A SAD GOING HOME FORHER IM AFRAID AND LAURIE OPENED HIS DESK AS IF WRITING TO AMY HADBEEN THE PROPER CONCLUSION OF THE SENTENCE LEFT UNFINISHED SOME WEEKSBEFORE
BUT HE DID NOT WRITE THE LETTER THAT DAY FOR AS HE RUMMAGED OUT HISBEST PAPER HE CAME ACROSS SOMETHING WHICH CHANGED HIS PURPOSE
 TUMBLINGABOUT IN ONE PART OF THE DESK AMONG BILLS PASSPORTS AND BUSINESSDOCUMENTS OF VARIOUS KINDS WERE SEVERAL OF JOS LETTERS AND IN ANOTHERCOMPARTMENT WERE THREE NOTES FROM AMY CAREFULLY TIED UP WITH ONE OF HERBLUE RIBBONS AND SWEETLY SUGGESTIVE OF THE LITTLE DEAD ROSES PUT AWAYINSIDE
 WITH A HALFREPENTANT HALFAMUSED EXPRESSION LAURIE GATHEREDUP ALL JOS LETTERS SMOOTHED FOLDED AND PUT THEM NEATLY INTO A SMALLDRAWER OF THE DESK STOOD A MINUTE TURNING THE RING THOUGHTFULLY ON HISFINGER THEN SLOWLY DREW IT OFF LAID IT WITH THE LETTERS LOCKED THEDRAWER AND WENT OUT TO HEAR HIGH MASS AT SAINT STEFANS FEELING AS IFTHERE HAD BEEN A FUNERAL AND THOUGH NOT OVERWHELMED WITH AFFLICTIONTHIS SEEMED A MORE PROPER WAY TO SPEND THE REST OF THE DAY THAN INWRITING LETTERS TO CHARMING YOUNG LADIES
     ILLUSTRATION TURNING THE RING THOUGHTFULLY UPON HIS FINGERTHE LETTER WENT VERY SOON HOWEVER AND WAS PROMPTLY ANSWERED FOR AMYWAS HOMESICK AND CONFESSED IT IN THE MOST DELIGHTFULLY CONFIDINGMANNER
 THE CORRESPONDENCE FLOURISHED FAMOUSLY AND LETTERS FLEW TO ANDFRO WITH UNFAILING REGULARITY ALL THROUGH THE EARLY SPRING
 LAURIESOLD HIS BUSTS MADE ALLUMETTES OF HIS OPERA AND WENT BACK TO PARISHOPING SOMEBODY WOULD ARRIVE BEFORE LONG
 HE WANTED DESPERATELY TO GO TONICE BUT WOULD NOT TILL HE WAS ASKED AND AMY WOULD NOT ASK HIM FORJUST THEN SHE WAS HAVING LITTLE EXPERIENCES OF HER OWN WHICH MADE HERRATHER WISH TO AVOID THE QUIZZICAL EYES OF OUR BOY
FRED VAUGHN HAD RETURNED AND PUT THE QUESTION TO WHICH SHE HAD ONCEDECIDED TO ANSWER YES THANK YOU BUT NOW SHE SAID NO THANK YOUKINDLY BUT STEADILY FOR WHEN THE TIME CAME HER COURAGE FAILED HERAND SHE FOUND THAT SOMETHING MORE THAN MONEY AND POSITION WAS NEEDED TOSATISFY THE NEW LONGING THAT FILLED HER HEART SO FULL OF TENDER HOPESAND FEARS
 THE WORDS FRED IS A GOOD FELLOW BUT NOT AT ALL THE MAN IFANCIED YOU WOULD EVER LIKE AND LAURIES FACE WHEN HE UTTERED THEMKEPT RETURNING TO HER AS PERTINACIOUSLY AS HER OWN DID WHEN SHE SAID INLOOK IF NOT IN WORDS I SHALL MARRY FOR MONEY
 IT TROUBLED HER TOREMEMBER THAT NOW SHE WISHED SHE COULD TAKE IT BACK IT SOUNDED SOUNWOMANLY
 SHE DIDNT WANT LAURIE TO THINK HER A HEARTLESS WORLDLYCREATURE SHE DIDNT CARE TO BE A QUEEN OF SOCIETY NOW HALF SO MUCH ASSHE DID TO BE A LOVABLE WOMAN SHE WAS SO GLAD HE DIDNT HATE HER FORTHE DREADFUL THINGS SHE SAID BUT TOOK THEM SO BEAUTIFULLY AND WASKINDER THAN EVER
 HIS LETTERS WERE SUCH A COMFORT FOR THE HOME LETTERSWERE VERY IRREGULAR AND WERE NOT HALF SO SATISFACTORY AS HIS WHEN THEYDID COME
 IT WAS NOT ONLY A PLEASURE BUT A DUTY TO ANSWER THEM FOR THEPOOR FELLOW WAS FORLORN AND NEEDED PETTING SINCE JO PERSISTED IN BEINGSTONYHEARTED
 SHE OUGHT TO HAVE MADE AN EFFORT AND TRIED TO LOVE HIMIT COULDNT BE VERY HARD MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE PROUD AND GLAD TO HAVESUCH A DEAR BOY CARE FOR THEM BUT JO NEVER WOULD ACT LIKE OTHER GIRLSSO THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT BE VERY KIND AND TREAT HIM LIKE ABROTHER
IF ALL BROTHERS WERE TREATED AS WELL AS LAURIE WAS AT THIS PERIOD THEYWOULD BE A MUCH HAPPIER RACE OF BEINGS THAN THEY ARE
 AMY NEVER LECTUREDNOW SHE ASKED HIS OPINION ON ALL SUBJECTS SHE WAS INTERESTED INEVERYTHING HE DID MADE CHARMING LITTLE PRESENTS FOR HIM AND SENT HIMTWO LETTERS A WEEK FULL OF LIVELY GOSSIP SISTERLY CONFIDENCES ANDCAPTIVATING SKETCHES OF THE LOVELY SCENES ABOUT HER
 AS FEW BROTHERS ARECOMPLIMENTED BY HAVING THEIR LETTERS CARRIED ABOUT IN THEIR SISTERSPOCKETS READ AND REREAD DILIGENTLY CRIED OVER WHEN SHORT KISSED WHENLONG AND TREASURED CAREFULLY WE WILL NOT HINT THAT AMY DID ANY OFTHESE FOND AND FOOLISH THINGS
 BUT SHE CERTAINLY DID GROW A LITTLE PALEAND PENSIVE THAT SPRING LOST MUCH OF HER RELISH FOR SOCIETY AND WENTOUT SKETCHING ALONE A GOOD DEAL
 SHE NEVER HAD MUCH TO SHOW WHEN SHECAME HOME BUT WAS STUDYING NATURE I DARE SAY WHILE SHE SAT FOR HOURSWITH HER HANDS FOLDED ON THE TERRACE AT VALROSA OR ABSENTLY SKETCHEDANY FANCY THAT OCCURRED TO HERA STALWART KNIGHT CARVED ON A TOMB AYOUNG MAN ASLEEP IN THE GRASS WITH HIS HAT OVER HIS EYES OR ACURLYHAIRED GIRL IN GORGEOUS ARRAY PROMENADING DOWN A BALLROOM ON THEARM OF A TALL GENTLEMAN BOTH FACES BEING LEFT A BLUR ACCORDING TO THELAST FASHION IN ART WHICH WAS SAFE BUT NOT ALTOGETHER SATISFACTORY
HER AUNT THOUGHT THAT SHE REGRETTED HER ANSWER TO FRED AND FINDINGDENIALS USELESS AND EXPLANATIONS IMPOSSIBLE AMY LEFT HER TO THINK WHATSHE LIKED TAKING CARE THAT LAURIE SHOULD KNOW THAT FRED HAD GONE TOEGYPT
 THAT WAS ALL BUT HE UNDERSTOOD IT AND LOOKED RELIEVED AS HESAID TO HIMSELF WITH A VENERABLE AIRI WAS SURE SHE WOULD THINK BETTER OF IT
 POOR OLD FELLOW
 IVE BEENTHROUGH IT ALL AND I CAN SYMPATHIZE
WITH THAT HE HEAVED A GREAT SIGH AND THEN AS IF HE HAD DISCHARGED HISDUTY TO THE PAST PUT HIS FEET UP ON THE SOFA AND ENJOYED AMYS LETTERLUXURIOUSLY
WHILE THESE CHANGES WERE GOING ON ABROAD TROUBLE HAD COME AT HOME BUTTHE LETTER TELLING THAT BETH WAS FAILING NEVER REACHED AMY AND WHEN THENEXT FOUND HER THE GRASS WAS GREEN ABOVE HER SISTER
 THE SAD NEWS METHER AT VEVAY FOR THE HEAT HAD DRIVEN THEM FROM NICE IN MAY AND THEYHAD TRAVELLED SLOWLY TO SWITZERLAND BY WAY OF GENOA AND THE ITALIANLAKES
 SHE BORE IT VERY WELL AND QUIETLY SUBMITTED TO THE FAMILY DECREETHAT SHE SHOULD NOT SHORTEN HER VISIT FOR SINCE IT WAS TOO LATE TO SAYGOODBY TO BETH SHE HAD BETTER STAY AND LET ABSENCE SOFTEN HER SORROW
BUT HER HEART WAS VERY HEAVY SHE LONGED TO BE AT HOME AND EVERY DAYLOOKED WISTFULLY ACROSS THE LAKE WAITING FOR LAURIE TO COME AND COMFORTHER
HE DID COME VERY SOON FOR THE SAME MAIL BROUGHT LETTERS TO THEM BOTHBUT HE WAS IN GERMANY AND IT TOOK SOME DAYS TO REACH HIM
 THE MOMENT HEREAD IT HE PACKED HIS KNAPSACK BADE ADIEU TO HIS FELLOWPEDESTRIANSAND WAS OFF TO KEEP HIS PROMISE WITH A HEART FULL OF JOY AND SORROWHOPE AND SUSPENSE
HE KNEW VEVAY WELL AND AS SOON AS THE BOAT TOUCHED THE LITTLE QUAY HEHURRIED ALONG THE SHORE TO LA TOUR WHERE THE CARROLS WERE LIVING ENPENSION
 THE GARÇON WAS IN DESPAIR THAT THE WHOLE FAMILY HAD GONE TOTAKE A PROMENADE ON THE LAKE BUT NO THE BLOND MADEMOISELLE MIGHT BE INTHE CHATEAU GARDEN
 IF MONSIEUR WOULD GIVE HIMSELF THE PAIN OF SITTINGDOWN A FLASH OF TIME SHOULD PRESENT HER
 BUT MONSIEUR COULD NOT WAITEVEN A FLASH OF TIME AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SPEECH DEPARTED TOFIND MADEMOISELLE HIMSELF
A PLEASANT OLD GARDEN ON THE BORDERS OF THE LOVELY LAKE WITH CHESTNUTSRUSTLING OVERHEAD IVY CLIMBING EVERYWHERE AND THE BLACK SHADOW OF THETOWER FALLING FAR ACROSS THE SUNNY WATER
 AT ONE CORNER OF THE WIDE LOWWALL WAS A SEAT AND HERE AMY OFTEN CAME TO READ OR WORK OR CONSOLEHERSELF WITH THE BEAUTY ALL ABOUT HER
 SHE WAS SITTING HERE THAT DAYLEANING HER HEAD ON HER HAND WITH A HOMESICK HEART AND HEAVY EYESTHINKING OF BETH AND WONDERING WHY LAURIE DID NOT COME
 SHE DID NOTHEAR HIM CROSS THE COURTYARD BEYOND NOR SEE HIM PAUSE IN THE ARCHWAYTHAT LED FROM THE SUBTERRANEAN PATH INTO THE GARDEN
 HE STOOD A MINUTELOOKING AT HER WITH NEW EYES SEEING WHAT NO ONE HAD EVER SEENBEFORETHE TENDER SIDE OF AMYS CHARACTER
 EVERYTHING ABOUT HER MUTELYSUGGESTED LOVE AND SORROWTHE BLOTTED LETTERS IN HER LAP THE BLACKRIBBON THAT TIED UP HER HAIR THE WOMANLY PAIN AND PATIENCE IN HER FACEEVEN THE LITTLE EBONY CROSS AT HER THROAT SEEMED PATHETIC TO LAURIE FORHE HAD GIVEN IT TO HER AND SHE WORE IT AS HER ONLY ORNAMENT
 IF HE HADANY DOUBTS ABOUT THE RECEPTION SHE WOULD GIVE HIM THEY WERE SET ATREST THE MINUTE SHE LOOKED UP AND SAW HIM FOR DROPPING EVERYTHING SHERAN TO HIM EXCLAIMING IN A TONE OF UNMISTAKABLE LOVE AND LONGINGO LAURIE LAURIE I KNEW YOUD COME TO ME
          ILLUSTRATION O LAURIE LAURIE I KNEW YOUD COMEI THINK EVERYTHING WAS SAID AND SETTLED THEN FOR AS THEY STOODTOGETHER QUITE SILENT FOR A MOMENT WITH THE DARK HEAD BENT DOWNPROTECTINGLY OVER THE LIGHT ONE AMY FELT THAT NO ONE COULD COMFORT ANDSUSTAIN HER SO WELL AS LAURIE AND LAURIE DECIDED THAT AMY WAS THE ONLYWOMAN IN THE WORLD WHO COULD FILL JOS PLACE AND MAKE HIM HAPPY
 HE DIDNOT TELL HER SO BUT SHE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED FOR BOTH FELT THE TRUTHWERE SATISFIED AND GLADLY LEFT THE REST TO SILENCE
IN A MINUTE AMY WENT BACK TO HER PLACE AND WHILE SHE DRIED HER TEARSLAURIE GATHERED UP THE SCATTERED PAPERS FINDING IN THE SIGHT OF SUNDRYWELLWORN LETTERS AND SUGGESTIVE SKETCHES GOOD OMENS FOR THE FUTURE
 ASHE SAT DOWN BESIDE HER AMY FELT SHY AGAIN AND TURNED ROSY RED AT THERECOLLECTION OF HER IMPULSIVE GREETING
I COULDNT HELP IT I FELT SO LONELY AND SAD AND WAS SO VERY GLAD TOSEE YOU
 IT WAS SUCH A SURPRISE TO LOOK UP AND FIND YOU JUST AS I WASBEGINNING TO FEAR YOU WOULDNT COME SHE SAID TRYING IN VAIN TO SPEAKQUITE NATURALLY
I CAME THE MINUTE I HEARD
 I WISH I COULD SAY SOMETHING TO COMFORT YOUFOR THE LOSS OF DEAR LITTLE BETH BUT I CAN ONLY FEEL AND HE COULDNOT GET ANY FURTHER FOR HE TOO TURNED BASHFUL ALL OF A SUDDEN ANDDID NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT TO SAY
 HE LONGED TO LAY AMYS HEAD DOWN ON HISSHOULDER AND TELL HER TO HAVE A GOOD CRY BUT HE DID NOT DARE SO TOOKHER HAND INSTEAD AND GAVE IT A SYMPATHETIC SQUEEZE THAT WAS BETTER THANWORDS
YOU NEEDNT SAY ANYTHING THIS COMFORTS ME SHE SAID SOFTLY
 BETH ISWELL AND HAPPY AND I MUSTNT WISH HER BACK BUT I DREAD THE GOING HOMEMUCH AS I LONG TO SEE THEM ALL
 WE WONT TALK ABOUT IT NOW FOR IT MAKESME CRY AND I WANT TO ENJOY YOU WHILE YOU STAY
 YOU NEEDNT GO RIGHTBACK NEED YOU
NOT IF YOU WANT ME DEAR
I DO SO MUCH
 AUNT AND FLO ARE VERY KIND BUT YOU SEEM LIKE ONE OF THEFAMILY AND IT WOULD BE SO COMFORTABLE TO HAVE YOU FOR A LITTLE WHILE
AMY SPOKE AND LOOKED SO LIKE A HOMESICK CHILD WHOSE HEART WAS FULLTHAT LAURIE FORGOT HIS BASHFULNESS ALL AT ONCE AND GAVE HER JUST WHATSHE WANTEDTHE PETTING SHE WAS USED TO AND THE CHEERFUL CONVERSATIONSHE NEEDED
POOR LITTLE SOUL YOU LOOK AS IF YOUD GRIEVED YOURSELF HALFSICK
 IMGOING TO TAKE CARE OF YOU SO DONT CRY ANY MORE BUT COME AND WALKABOUT WITH ME THE WIND IS TOO CHILLY FOR YOU TO SIT STILL HE SAID INTHE HALFCARESSING HALFCOMMANDING WAY THAT AMY LIKED AS HE TIED ONHER HAT DREW HER ARM THROUGH HIS AND BEGAN TO PACE UP AND DOWN THESUNNY WALK UNDER THE NEWLEAVED CHESTNUTS
 HE FELT MORE AT EASE UPONHIS LEGS AND AMY FOUND IT VERY PLEASANT TO HAVE A STRONG ARM TO LEANUPON A FAMILIAR FACE TO SMILE AT HER AND A KIND VOICE TO TALKDELIGHTFULLY FOR HER ALONE
THE QUAINT OLD GARDEN HAD SHELTERED MANY PAIRS OF LOVERS AND SEEMEDEXPRESSLY MADE FOR THEM SO SUNNY AND SECLUDED WAS IT WITH NOTHING BUTTHE TOWER TO OVERLOOK THEM AND THE WIDE LAKE TO CARRY AWAY THE ECHO OFTHEIR WORDS AS IT RIPPLED BY BELOW
 FOR AN HOUR THIS NEW PAIR WALKEDAND TALKED OR RESTED ON THE WALL ENJOYING THE SWEET INFLUENCES WHICHGAVE SUCH A CHARM TO TIME AND PLACE AND WHEN AN UNROMANTIC DINNERBELLWARNED THEM AWAY AMY FELT AS IF SHE LEFT HER BURDEN OF LONELINESS ANDSORROW BEHIND HER IN THE CHATEAU GARDEN
THE MOMENT MRS
 CARROL SAW THE GIRLS ALTERED FACE SHE WAS ILLUMINATEDWITH A NEW IDEA AND EXCLAIMED TO HERSELF NOW I UNDERSTAND ITALLTHE CHILD HAS BEEN PINING FOR YOUNG LAURENCE
 BLESS MY HEART INEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING
WITH PRAISEWORTHY DISCRETION THE GOOD LADY SAID NOTHING AND BETRAYEDNO SIGN OF ENLIGHTENMENT BUT CORDIALLY URGED LAURIE TO STAY AND BEGGEDAMY TO ENJOY HIS SOCIETY FOR IT WOULD DO HER MORE GOOD THAN SO MUCHSOLITUDE
 AMY WAS A MODEL OF DOCILITY AND AS HER AUNT WAS A GOOD DEALOCCUPIED WITH FLO SHE WAS LEFT TO ENTERTAIN HER FRIEND AND DID IT WITHMORE THAN HER USUAL SUCCESS
AT NICE LAURIE HAD LOUNGED AND AMY HAD SCOLDED AT VEVAY LAURIE WASNEVER IDLE BUT ALWAYS WALKING RIDING BOATING OR STUDYING IN THEMOST ENERGETIC MANNER WHILE AMY ADMIRED EVERYTHING HE DID AND FOLLOWEDHIS EXAMPLE AS FAR AND AS FAST AS SHE COULD
 HE SAID THE CHANGE WASOWING TO THE CLIMATE AND SHE DID NOT CONTRADICT HIM BEING GLAD OF ALIKE EXCUSE FOR HER OWN RECOVERED HEALTH AND SPIRITS
THE INVIGORATING AIR DID THEM BOTH GOOD AND MUCH EXERCISE WORKEDWHOLESOME CHANGES IN MINDS AS WELL AS BODIES
 THEY SEEMED TO GET CLEARERVIEWS OF LIFE AND DUTY UP THERE AMONG THE EVERLASTING HILLS THE FRESHWINDS BLEW AWAY DESPONDING DOUBTS DELUSIVE FANCIES AND MOODY MISTSTHE WARM SPRING SUNSHINE BROUGHT OUT ALL SORTS OF ASPIRING IDEAS TENDERHOPES AND HAPPY THOUGHTS THE LAKE SEEMED TO WASH AWAY THE TROUBLES OFTHE PAST AND THE GRAND OLD MOUNTAINS TO LOOK BENIGNLY DOWN UPON THEMSAYING LITTLE CHILDREN LOVE ONE ANOTHER
IN SPITE OF THE NEW SORROW IT WAS A VERY HAPPY TIME SO HAPPY THATLAURIE COULD NOT BEAR TO DISTURB IT BY A WORD
 IT TOOK HIM A LITTLEWHILE TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE AT THE RAPID CURE OF HIS FIRST ANDAS HE HAD FIRMLY BELIEVED HIS LAST AND ONLY LOVE
 HE CONSOLED HIMSELFFOR THE SEEMING DISLOYALTY BY THE THOUGHT THAT JOS SISTER WAS ALMOSTTHE SAME AS JOS SELF AND THE CONVICTION THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEENIMPOSSIBLE TO LOVE ANY OTHER WOMAN BUT AMY SO SOON AND SO WELL
 HISFIRST WOOING HAD BEEN OF THE TEMPESTUOUS ORDER AND HE LOOKED BACK UPONIT AS IF THROUGH A LONG VISTA OF YEARS WITH A FEELING OF COMPASSIONBLENDED WITH REGRET
 HE WAS NOT ASHAMED OF IT BUT PUT IT AWAY AS ONE OFTHE BITTERSWEET EXPERIENCES OF HIS LIFE FOR WHICH HE COULD BE GRATEFULWHEN THE PAIN WAS OVER
 HIS SECOND WOOING HE RESOLVED SHOULD BE AS CALMAND SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE THERE WAS NO NEED OF HAVING A SCENE HARDLY ANYNEED OF TELLING AMY THAT HE LOVED HER SHE KNEW IT WITHOUT WORDS ANDHAD GIVEN HIM HIS ANSWER LONG AGO
 IT ALL CAME ABOUT SO NATURALLY THATNO ONE COULD COMPLAIN AND HE KNEW THAT EVERYBODY WOULD BE PLEASED EVENJO
 BUT WHEN OUR FIRST LITTLE PASSION HAS BEEN CRUSHED WE ARE APT TO BEWARY AND SLOW IN MAKING A SECOND TRIAL SO LAURIE LET THE DAYS PASSENJOYING EVERY HOUR AND LEAVING TO CHANCE THE UTTERANCE OF THE WORDTHAT WOULD PUT AN END TO THE FIRST AND SWEETEST PART OF HIS NEW ROMANCE
HE HAD RATHER IMAGINED THAT THE DÉNOUEMENT WOULD TAKE PLACE IN THECHATEAU GARDEN BY MOONLIGHT AND IN THE MOST GRACEFUL AND DECOROUSMANNER BUT IT TURNED OUT EXACTLY THE REVERSE FOR THE MATTER WASSETTLED ON THE LAKE AT NOONDAY IN A FEW BLUNT WORDS
 THEY HAD BEENFLOATING ABOUT ALL THE MORNING FROM GLOOMY ST
 GINGOLF TO SUNNYMONTREUX WITH THE ALPS OF SAVOY ON ONE SIDE MONT ST
 BERNARD AND THEDENT DU MIDI ON THE OTHER PRETTY VEVAY IN THE VALLEY AND LAUSANNE UPONTHE HILL BEYOND A CLOUDLESS BLUE SKY OVERHEAD AND THE BLUER LAKEBELOW DOTTED WITH THE PICTURESQUE BOATS THAT LOOK LIKE WHITEWINGEDGULLS
THEY HAD BEEN TALKING OF BONNIVARD AS THEY GLIDED PAST CHILLON AND OFROUSSEAU AS THEY LOOKED UP AT CLARENS WHERE HE WROTE HIS HÉLOISE
NEITHER HAD READ IT BUT THEY KNEW IT WAS A LOVESTORY AND EACHPRIVATELY WONDERED IF IT WAS HALF AS INTERESTING AS THEIR OWN
 AMY HADBEEN DABBLING HER HAND IN THE WATER DURING THE LITTLE PAUSE THAT FELLBETWEEN THEM AND WHEN SHE LOOKED UP LAURIE WAS LEANING ON HIS OARSWITH AN EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES THAT MADE HER SAY HASTILY MERELY FOR THESAKE OF SAYING SOMETHINGYOU MUST BE TIRED REST A LITTLE AND LET ME ROW IT WILL DO ME GOODFOR SINCE YOU CAME I HAVE BEEN ALTOGETHER LAZY AND LUXURIOUS
IM NOT TIRED BUT YOU MAY TAKE AN OAR IF YOU LIKE
 THERES ROOMENOUGH THOUGH I HAVE TO SIT NEARLY IN THE MIDDLE ELSE THE BOAT WONTTRIM RETURNED LAURIE AS IF HE RATHER LIKED THE ARRANGEMENT
FEELING THAT SHE HAD NOT MENDED MATTERS MUCH AMY TOOK THE OFFERED THIRDOF A SEAT SHOOK HER HAIR OVER HER FACE AND ACCEPTED AN OAR
 SHE ROWEDAS WELL AS SHE DID MANY OTHER THINGS AND THOUGH SHE USED BOTH HANDSAND LAURIE BUT ONE THE OARS KEPT TIME AND THE BOAT WENT SMOOTHLYTHROUGH THE WATER
               ILLUSTRATION HOW WELL WE PULL TOGETHERHOW WELL WE PULL TOGETHER DONT WE
 SAID AMY WHO OBJECTED TO SILENCEJUST THEN
SO WELL THAT I WISH WE MIGHT ALWAYS PULL IN THE SAME BOAT
 WILL YOUAMY
 VERY TENDERLY
YES LAURIE VERY LOW
THEN THEY BOTH STOPPED ROWING AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ADDED A PRETTY LITTLETABLEAU OF HUMAN LOVE AND HAPPINESS TO THE DISSOLVING VIEWS REFLECTEDIN THE LAKE
                                 XLII
                               ALL ALONE
IT WAS EASY TO PROMISE SELFABNEGATION WHEN SELF WAS WRAPPED UP INANOTHER AND HEART AND SOUL WERE PURIFIED BY A SWEET EXAMPLE BUT WHENTHE HELPFUL VOICE WAS SILENT THE DAILY LESSON OVER THE BELOVEDPRESENCE GONE AND NOTHING REMAINED BUT LONELINESS AND GRIEF THEN JOFOUND HER PROMISE VERY HARD TO KEEP
 HOW COULD SHE COMFORT FATHER ANDMOTHER WHEN HER OWN HEART ACHED WITH A CEASELESS LONGING FOR HERSISTER HOW COULD SHE MAKE THE HOUSE CHEERFUL WHEN ALL ITS LIGHT ANDWARMTH AND BEAUTY SEEMED TO HAVE DESERTED IT WHEN BETH LEFT THE OLD HOMEFOR THE NEW AND WHERE IN ALL THE WORLD COULD SHE FIND SOME USEFULHAPPY WORK TO DO THAT WOULD TAKE THE PLACE OF THE LOVING SERVICE WHICHHAD BEEN ITS OWN REWARD
 SHE TRIED IN A BLIND HOPELESS WAY TO DO HERDUTY SECRETLY REBELLING AGAINST IT ALL THE WHILE FOR IT SEEMED UNJUSTTHAT HER FEW JOYS SHOULD BE LESSENED HER BURDENS MADE HEAVIER AND LIFEGET HARDER AND HARDER AS SHE TOILED ALONG
 SOME PEOPLE SEEMED TO GET ALLSUNSHINE AND SOME ALL SHADOW IT WAS NOT FAIR FOR SHE TRIED MORE THANAMY TO BE GOOD BUT NEVER GOT ANY REWARD ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT TROUBLEAND HARD WORK
POOR JO THESE WERE DARK DAYS TO HER FOR SOMETHING LIKE DESPAIR CAMEOVER HER WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF SPENDING ALL HER LIFE IN THAT QUIET HOUSEDEVOTED TO HUMDRUM CARES A FEW SMALL PLEASURES AND THE DUTY THAT NEVERSEEMED TO GROW ANY EASIER
 I CANT DO IT
 I WASNT MEANT FOR A LIFELIKE THIS AND I KNOW I SHALL BREAK AWAY AND DO SOMETHING DESPERATE IFSOMEBODY DONT COME AND HELP ME SHE SAID TO HERSELF WHEN HER FIRSTEFFORTS FAILED AND SHE FELL INTO THE MOODY MISERABLE STATE OF MINDWHICH OFTEN COMES WHEN STRONG WILLS HAVE TO YIELD TO THE INEVITABLE
BUT SOME ONE DID COME AND HELP HER THOUGH JO DID NOT RECOGNIZE HER GOODANGELS AT ONCE BECAUSE THEY WORE FAMILIAR SHAPES AND USED THE SIMPLESPELLS BEST FITTED TO POOR HUMANITY
 OFTEN SHE STARTED UP AT NIGHTTHINKING BETH CALLED HER AND WHEN THE SIGHT OF THE LITTLE EMPTY BEDMADE HER CRY WITH THE BITTER CRY OF AN UNSUBMISSIVE SORROW O BETHCOME BACK
 COME BACK
 SHE DID NOT STRETCH OUT HER YEARNING ARMS INVAIN FOR AS QUICK TO HEAR HER SOBBING AS SHE HAD BEEN TO HEAR HERSISTERS FAINTEST WHISPER HER MOTHER CAME TO COMFORT HER NOT WITHWORDS ONLY BUT THE PATIENT TENDERNESS THAT SOOTHES BY A TOUCH TEARSTHAT WERE MUTE REMINDERS OF A GREATER GRIEF THAN JOS AND BROKENWHISPERS MORE ELOQUENT THAN PRAYERS BECAUSE HOPEFUL RESIGNATION WENTHANDINHAND WITH NATURAL SORROW
 SACRED MOMENTS WHEN HEART TALKED TOHEART IN THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT TURNING AFFLICTION TO A BLESSINGWHICH CHASTENED GRIEF AND STRENGTHENED LOVE
 FEELING THIS JOS BURDENSEEMED EASIER TO BEAR DUTY GREW SWEETER AND LIFE LOOKED MOREENDURABLE SEEN FROM THE SAFE SHELTER OF HER MOTHERS ARMS
WHEN ACHING HEART WAS A LITTLE COMFORTED TROUBLED MIND LIKEWISE FOUNDHELP FOR ONE DAY SHE WENT TO THE STUDY AND LEANING OVER THE GOOD GRAYHEAD LIFTED TO WELCOME HER WITH A TRANQUIL SMILE SHE SAID VERYHUMBLYFATHER TALK TO ME AS YOU DID TO BETH
 I NEED IT MORE THAN SHE DID FORIM ALL WRONG
MY DEAR NOTHING CAN COMFORT ME LIKE THIS HE ANSWERED WITH A FALTERIN HIS VOICE AND BOTH ARMS ROUND HER AS IF HE TOO NEEDED HELP ANDDID NOT FEAR TO ASK IT
                   ILLUSTRATION JO AND HER FATHERTHEN SITTING IN BETHS LITTLE CHAIR CLOSE BESIDE HIM JO TOLD HERTROUBLESTHE RESENTFUL SORROW FOR HER LOSS THE FRUITLESS EFFORTS THATDISCOURAGED HER THE WANT OF FAITH THAT MADE LIFE LOOK SO DARK AND ALLTHE SAD BEWILDERMENT WHICH WE CALL DESPAIR
 SHE GAVE HIM ENTIRECONFIDENCE HE GAVE HER THE HELP SHE NEEDED AND BOTH FOUND CONSOLATIONIN THE ACT FOR THE TIME HAD COME WHEN THEY COULD TALK TOGETHER NOT ONLYAS FATHER AND DAUGHTER BUT AS MAN AND WOMAN ABLE AND GLAD TO SERVEEACH OTHER WITH MUTUAL SYMPATHY AS WELL AS MUTUAL LOVE
 HAPPYTHOUGHTFUL TIMES THERE IN THE OLD STUDY WHICH JO CALLED THE CHURCH OFONE MEMBER AND FROM WHICH SHE CAME WITH FRESH COURAGE RECOVEREDCHEERFULNESS AND A MORE SUBMISSIVE SPIRIT FOR THE PARENTS WHO HADTAUGHT ONE CHILD TO MEET DEATH WITHOUT FEAR WERE TRYING NOW TO TEACHANOTHER TO ACCEPT LIFE WITHOUT DESPONDENCY OR DISTRUST AND TO USE ITSBEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITIES WITH GRATITUDE AND POWER
OTHER HELPS HAD JOHUMBLE WHOLESOME DUTIES AND DELIGHTS THAT WOULDNOT BE DENIED THEIR PART IN SERVING HER AND WHICH SHE SLOWLY LEARNED TOSEE AND VALUE
 BROOMS AND DISHCLOTHS NEVER COULD BE AS DISTASTEFUL ASTHEY ONCE HAD BEEN FOR BETH HAD PRESIDED OVER BOTH AND SOMETHING OFHER HOUSEWIFELY SPIRIT SEEMED TO LINGER ROUND THE LITTLE MOP AND THE OLDBRUSH THAT WAS NEVER THROWN AWAY
 AS SHE USED THEM JO FOUND HERSELFHUMMING THE SONGS BETH USED TO HUM IMITATING BETHS ORDERLY WAYS ANDGIVING THE LITTLE TOUCHES HERE AND THERE THAT KEPT EVERYTHING FRESH ANDCOSEY WHICH WAS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD MAKING HOME HAPPY THOUGH SHEDIDNT KNOW IT TILL HANNAH SAID WITH AN APPROVING SQUEEZE OF THEHANDYOU THOUGHTFUL CRETER YOURE DETERMINED WE SHANT MISS THAT DEAR LAMBEF YOU CAN HELP IT
 WE DONT SAY MUCH BUT WE SEE IT AND THE LORD WILLBLESS YOU FORT SEE EF HE DONT
AS THEY SAT SEWING TOGETHER JO DISCOVERED HOW MUCH IMPROVED HER SISTERMEG WAS HOW WELL SHE COULD TALK HOW MUCH SHE KNEW ABOUT GOOD WOMANLYIMPULSES THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS HOW HAPPY SHE WAS IN HUSBAND ANDCHILDREN AND HOW MUCH THEY WERE ALL DOING FOR EACH OTHER
MARRIAGE IS AN EXCELLENT THING AFTER ALL
 I WONDER IF I SHOULD BLOSSOMOUT HALF AS WELL AS YOU HAVE IF I TRIED IT
 SAID JO AS SHECONSTRUCTED A KITE FOR DEMI IN THE TOPSYTURVY NURSERY
ITS JUST WHAT YOU NEED TO BRING OUT THE TENDER WOMANLY HALF OF YOURNATURE JO
 YOU ARE LIKE A CHESTNUTBURR PRICKLY OUTSIDE BUTSILKYSOFT WITHIN AND A SWEET KERNEL IF ONE CAN ONLY GET AT IT
 LOVEWILL MAKE YOU SHOW YOUR HEART SOME DAY AND THEN THE ROUGH BURR WILLFALL OFF
FROST OPENS CHESTNUTBURRS MAAM AND IT TAKES A GOOD SHAKE TO BRINGTHEM DOWN
 BOYS GO NUTTING AND I DONT CARE TO BE BAGGED BY THEMRETURNED JO PASTING AWAY AT THE KITE WHICH NO WIND THAT BLOWS WOULDEVER CARRY UP FOR DAISY HAD TIED HERSELF ON AS A BOB
MEG LAUGHED FOR SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE A GLIMMER OF JOS OLD SPIRIT BUTSHE FELT IT HER DUTY TO ENFORCE HER OPINION BY EVERY ARGUMENT IN HERPOWER AND THE SISTERLY CHATS WERE NOT WASTED ESPECIALLY AS TWO OFMEGS MOST EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS WERE THE BABIES WHOM JO LOVED TENDERLY
GRIEF IS THE BEST OPENER FOR SOME HEARTS AND JOS WAS NEARLY READY FORTHE BAG A LITTLE MORE SUNSHINE TO RIPEN THE NUT THEN NOT A BOYSIMPATIENT SHAKE BUT A MANS HAND REACHED UP TO PICK IT GENTLY FROM THEBURR AND FIND THE KERNEL SOUND AND SWEET
 IF SHE HAD SUSPECTED THISSHE WOULD HAVE SHUT UP TIGHT AND BEEN MORE PRICKLY THAN EVERFORTUNATELY SHE WASNT THINKING ABOUT HERSELF SO WHEN THE TIME CAMEDOWN SHE DROPPED
NOW IF SHE HAD BEEN THE HEROINE OF A MORAL STORYBOOK SHE OUGHT ATTHIS PERIOD OF HER LIFE TO HAVE BECOME QUITE SAINTLY RENOUNCED THEWORLD AND GONE ABOUT DOING GOOD IN A MORTIFIED BONNET WITH TRACTS INHER POCKET
 BUT YOU SEE JO WASNT A HEROINE SHE WAS ONLY A STRUGGLINGHUMAN GIRL LIKE HUNDREDS OF OTHERS AND SHE JUST ACTED OUT HER NATUREBEING SAD CROSS LISTLESS OR ENERGETIC AS THE MOOD SUGGESTED
 ITSHIGHLY VIRTUOUS TO SAY WELL BE GOOD BUT WE CANT DO IT ALL AT ONCEAND IT TAKES A LONG PULL A STRONG PULL AND A PULL ALL TOGETHERBEFORE SOME OF US EVEN GET OUR FEET SET IN THE RIGHT WAY
 JO HAD GOT SOFAR SHE WAS LEARNING TO DO HER DUTY AND TO FEEL UNHAPPY IF SHE DIDNOT BUT TO DO IT CHEERFULLYAH THAT WAS ANOTHER THING
 SHE HAD OFTENSAID SHE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING SPLENDID NO MATTER HOW HARD AND NOWSHE HAD HER WISH FOR WHAT COULD BE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN TO DEVOTE HERLIFE TO FATHER AND MOTHER TRYING TO MAKE HOME AS HAPPY TO THEM AS THEYHAD TO HER
 AND IF DIFFICULTIES WERE NECESSARY TO INCREASE THE SPLENDOROF THE EFFORT WHAT COULD BE HARDER FOR A RESTLESS AMBITIOUS GIRL THANTO GIVE UP HER OWN HOPES PLANS AND DESIRES AND CHEERFULLY LIVE FOROTHERS
PROVIDENCE HAD TAKEN HER AT HER WORD HERE WAS THE TASK NOT WHAT SHEHAD EXPECTED BUT BETTER BECAUSE SELF HAD NO PART IN IT NOW COULD SHEDO IT
 SHE DECIDED THAT SHE WOULD TRY AND IN HER FIRST ATTEMPT SHEFOUND THE HELPS I HAVE SUGGESTED
 STILL ANOTHER WAS GIVEN HER AND SHETOOK IT NOT AS A REWARD BUT AS A COMFORT AS CHRISTIAN TOOK THEREFRESHMENT AFFORDED BY THE LITTLE ARBOR WHERE HE RESTED AS HE CLIMBEDTHE HILL CALLED DIFFICULTY
WHY DONT YOU WRITE
 THAT ALWAYS USED TO MAKE YOU HAPPY SAID HERMOTHER ONCE WHEN THE DESPONDING FIT OVERSHADOWED JO
IVE NO HEART TO WRITE AND IF I HAD NOBODY CARES FOR MY THINGS
WE DO WRITE SOMETHING FOR US AND NEVER MIND THE REST OF THE WORLD
TRY IT DEAR IM SURE IT WOULD DO YOU GOOD AND PLEASE US VERY MUCH
DONT BELIEVE I CAN BUT JO GOT OUT HER DESK AND BEGAN TO OVERHAULHER HALFFINISHED MANUSCRIPTS
AN HOUR AFTERWARD HER MOTHER PEEPED IN AND THERE SHE WAS SCRATCHINGAWAY WITH HER BLACK PINAFORE ON AND AN ABSORBED EXPRESSION WHICHCAUSED MRS
 MARCH TO SMILE AND SLIP AWAY WELL PLEASED WITH THE SUCCESSOF HER SUGGESTION
 JO NEVER KNEW HOW IT HAPPENED BUT SOMETHING GOT INTOTHAT STORY THAT WENT STRAIGHT TO THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO READ IT FORWHEN HER FAMILY HAD LAUGHED AND CRIED OVER IT HER FATHER SENT IT MUCHAGAINST HER WILL TO ONE OF THE POPULAR MAGAZINES AND TO HER UTTERSURPRISE IT WAS NOT ONLY PAID FOR BUT OTHERS REQUESTED
 LETTERS FROMSEVERAL PERSONS WHOSE PRAISE WAS HONOR FOLLOWED THE APPEARANCE OF THELITTLE STORY NEWSPAPERS COPIED IT AND STRANGERS AS WELL AS FRIENDSADMIRED IT
 FOR A SMALL THING IT WAS A GREAT SUCCESS AND JO WAS MOREASTONISHED THAN WHEN HER NOVEL WAS COMMENDED AND CONDEMNED ALL AT ONCE
I DONT UNDERSTAND IT
 WHAT CAN THERE BE IN A SIMPLE LITTLE STORYLIKE THAT TO MAKE PEOPLE PRAISE IT SO
 SHE SAID QUITE BEWILDERED
THERE IS TRUTH IN IT JO THATS THE SECRET HUMOR AND PATHOS MAKE ITALIVE AND YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR STYLE AT LAST
 YOU WROTE WITH NO THOUGHTOF FAME OR MONEY AND PUT YOUR HEART INTO IT MY DAUGHTER YOU HAVE HADTHE BITTER NOW COMES THE SWEET
 DO YOUR BEST AND GROW AS HAPPY AS WEARE IN YOUR SUCCESS
IF THERE IS ANYTHING GOOD OR TRUE IN WHAT I WRITE IT ISNT MINE IOWE IT ALL TO YOU AND MOTHER AND TO BETH SAID JO MORE TOUCHED BY HERFATHERS WORDS THAN BY ANY AMOUNT OF PRAISE FROM THE WORLD
SO TAUGHT BY LOVE AND SORROW JO WROTE HER LITTLE STORIES AND SENTTHEM AWAY TO MAKE FRIENDS FOR THEMSELVES AND HER FINDING IT A VERYCHARITABLE WORLD TO SUCH HUMBLE WANDERERS FOR THEY WERE KINDLYWELCOMED AND SENT HOME COMFORTABLE TOKENS TO THEIR MOTHER LIKE DUTIFULCHILDREN WHOM GOOD FORTUNE OVERTAKES
WHEN AMY AND LAURIE WROTE OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT MRS
 MARCH FEARED THAT JOWOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO REJOICE OVER IT BUT HER FEARS WERE SOON SETAT REST FOR THOUGH JO LOOKED GRAVE AT FIRST SHE TOOK IT VERY QUIETLYAND WAS FULL OF HOPES AND PLANS FOR THE CHILDREN BEFORE SHE READ THELETTER TWICE
 IT WAS A SORT OF WRITTEN DUET WHEREIN EACH GLORIFIED THEOTHER IN LOVERLIKE FASHION VERY PLEASANT TO READ AND SATISFACTORY TOTHINK OF FOR NO ONE HAD ANY OBJECTION TO MAKE
YOU LIKE IT MOTHER
 SAID JO AS THEY LAID DOWN THE CLOSELY WRITTENSHEETS AND LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER
YES I HOPED IT WOULD BE SO EVER SINCE AMY WROTE THAT SHE HAD REFUSEDFRED
 I FELT SURE THEN THAT SOMETHING BETTER THAN WHAT YOU CALL THEMERCENARY SPIRIT HAD COME OVER HER AND A HINT HERE AND THERE IN HERLETTERS MADE ME SUSPECT THAT LOVE AND LAURIE WOULD WIN THE DAY
HOW SHARP YOU ARE MARMEE AND HOW SILENT
 YOU NEVER SAID A WORD TOME
MOTHERS HAVE NEED OF SHARP EYES AND DISCREET TONGUES WHEN THEY HAVEGIRLS TO MANAGE
 I WAS HALF AFRAID TO PUT THE IDEA INTO YOUR HEAD LESTYOU SHOULD WRITE AND CONGRATULATE THEM BEFORE THE THING WAS SETTLED
IM NOT THE SCATTERBRAIN I WAS YOU MAY TRUST ME IM SOBER ANDSENSIBLE ENOUGH FOR ANY ONES CONFIDANTE NOW
SO YOU ARE DEAR AND I SHOULD HAVE MADE YOU MINE ONLY I FANCIED ITMIGHT PAIN YOU TO LEARN THAT YOUR TEDDY LOVED ANY ONE ELSE
NOW MOTHER DID YOU REALLY THINK I COULD BE SO SILLY AND SELFISHAFTER ID REFUSED HIS LOVE WHEN IT WAS FRESHEST IF NOT BEST
I KNEW YOU WERE SINCERE THEN JO BUT LATELY I HAVE THOUGHT THAT IF HECAME BACK AND ASKED AGAIN YOU MIGHT PERHAPS FEEL LIKE GIVING ANOTHERANSWER
 FORGIVE ME DEAR I CANT HELP SEEING THAT YOU ARE VERY LONELYAND SOMETIMES THERE IS A HUNGRY LOOK IN YOUR EYES THAT GOES TO MY HEARTSO I FANCIED THAT YOUR BOY MIGHT FILL THE EMPTY PLACE IF HE TRIED NOW
NO MOTHER IT IS BETTER AS IT IS AND IM GLAD AMY HAS LEARNED TO LOVEHIM
 BUT YOU ARE RIGHT IN ONE THING I AM LONELY AND PERHAPS IF TEDDYHAD TRIED AGAIN I MIGHT HAVE SAID YES NOT BECAUSE I LOVE HIM ANYMORE BUT BECAUSE I CARE MORE TO BE LOVED THAN WHEN HE WENT AWAY
IM GLAD OF THAT JO FOR IT SHOWS THAT YOU ARE GETTING ON
 THERE AREPLENTY TO LOVE YOU SO TRY TO BE SATISFIED WITH FATHER AND MOTHERSISTERS AND BROTHERS FRIENDS AND BABIES TILL THE BEST LOVER OF ALLCOMES TO GIVE YOU YOUR REWARD
MOTHERS ARE THE BEST LOVERS IN THE WORLD BUT I DONT MIND WHISPERINGTO MARMEE THAT ID LIKE TO TRY ALL KINDS
 ITS VERY CURIOUS BUT THEMORE I TRY TO SATISFY MYSELF WITH ALL SORTS OF NATURAL AFFECTIONS THEMORE I SEEM TO WANT
 ID NO IDEA HEARTS COULD TAKE IN SO MANY MINE ISSO ELASTIC IT NEVER SEEMS FULL NOW AND I USED TO BE QUITE CONTENTEDWITH MY FAMILY
 I DONT UNDERSTAND IT

 I NEVER KNEW HOW GOOD AND GENEROUS AND TENDERHE WAS TILL NOW FOR HE LETS ME READ HIS HEART AND I FIND IT FULL OFNOBLE IMPULSES AND HOPES AND PURPOSES AND AM SO PROUD TO KNOW ITSMINE
 HE SAYS HE FEELS AS IF HE COULD MAKE A PROSPEROUS VOYAGE NOWWITH ME ABOARD AS MATE AND LOTS OF LOVE FOR BALLAST
 I PRAY HE MAYAND TRY TO BE ALL HE BELIEVES ME FOR I LOVE MY GALLANT CAPTAIN WITH ALLMY HEART AND SOUL AND MIGHT AND NEVER WILL DESERT HIM WHILE GOD LETSUS BE TOGETHER
 O MOTHER I NEVER KNEW HOW MUCH LIKE HEAVEN THIS WORLDCOULD BE WHEN TWO PEOPLE LOVE AND LIVE FOR ONE ANOTHER
AND THATS OUR COOL RESERVED AND WORLDLY AMY
 TRULY LOVE DOES WORKMIRACLES
 HOW VERY VERY HAPPY THEY MUST BE
 AND JO LAID THE RUSTLINGSHEETS TOGETHER WITH A CAREFUL HAND AS ONE MIGHT SHUT THE COVERS OF ALOVELY ROMANCE WHICH HOLDS THE READER FAST TILL THE END COMES AND HEFINDS HIMSELF ALONE IN THE WORKADAY WORLD AGAIN
BY AND BY JO ROAMED AWAY UPSTAIRS FOR IT WAS RAINY AND SHE COULD NOTWALK
 A RESTLESS SPIRIT POSSESSED HER AND THE OLD FEELING CAME AGAINNOT BITTER AS IT ONCE WAS BUT A SORROWFULLY PATIENT WONDER WHY ONESISTER SHOULD HAVE ALL SHE ASKED THE OTHER NOTHING
 IT WAS NOT TRUESHE KNEW THAT AND TRIED TO PUT IT AWAY BUT THE NATURAL CRAVING FORAFFECTION WAS STRONG AND AMYS HAPPINESS WOKE THE HUNGRY LONGING FORSOME ONE TO LOVE WITH HEART AND SOUL AND CLING TO WHILE GOD LET THEMBE TOGETHER
UP IN THE GARRET WHERE JOS UNQUIET WANDERINGS ENDED STOOD FOUR LITTLEWOODEN CHESTS IN A ROW EACH MARKED WITH ITS OWNERS NAME AND EACHFILLED WITH RELICS OF THE CHILDHOOD AND GIRLHOOD ENDED NOW FOR ALL
 JOGLANCED INTO THEM AND WHEN SHE CAME TO HER OWN LEANED HER CHIN ON THEEDGE AND STARED ABSENTLY AT THE CHAOTIC COLLECTION TILL A BUNDLE OFOLD EXERCISEBOOKS CAUGHT HER EYE
 SHE DREW THEM OUT TURNED THEM OVERAND RELIVED THAT PLEASANT WINTER AT KIND MRS
 KIRKES
 SHE HAD SMILEDAT FIRST THEN SHE LOOKED THOUGHTFUL NEXT SAD AND WHEN SHE CAME TO ALITTLE MESSAGE WRITTEN IN THE PROFESSORS HAND HER LIPS BEGAN TOTREMBLE THE BOOKS SLID OUT OF HER LAP AND SHE SAT LOOKING AT THEFRIENDLY WORDS AS IF THEY TOOK A NEW MEANING AND TOUCHED A TENDER SPOTIN HER HEART
WAIT FOR ME MY FRIEND
 I MAY BE A LITTLE LATE BUT I SHALL SURELYCOME
OH IF HE ONLY WOULD
 SO KIND SO GOOD SO PATIENT WITH ME ALWAYS MYDEAR OLD FRITZ I DIDNT VALUE HIM HALF ENOUGH WHEN I HAD HIM BUT NOWHOW I SHOULD LOVE TO SEE HIM FOR EVERY ONE SEEMS GOING AWAY FROM MEAND IM ALL ALONE
AND HOLDING THE LITTLE PAPER FAST AS IF IT WERE A PROMISE YET TO BEFULFILLED JO LAID HER HEAD DOWN ON A COMFORTABLE RAGBAG AND CRIED ASIF IN OPPOSITION TO THE RAIN PATTERING ON THE ROOF
  ILLUSTRATION JO LAID HER HEAD ON A COMFORTABLE RAGBAG AND CRIEDWAS IT ALL SELFPITY LONELINESS OR LOW SPIRITS
 OR WAS IT THE WAKINGUP OF A SENTIMENT WHICH HAD BIDED ITS TIME AS PATIENTLY AS ITS INSPIRER
WHO SHALL SAY
     ILLUSTRATION A SUBSTANTIAL LIFELIKE GHOST LEANING OVER HER                                 XLIII
                               SURPRISES
JO WAS ALONE IN THE TWILIGHT LYING ON THE OLD SOFA LOOKING AT THEFIRE AND THINKING
 IT WAS HER FAVORITE WAY OF SPENDING THE HOUR OFDUSK NO ONE DISTURBED HER AND SHE USED TO LIE THERE ON BETHS LITTLERED PILLOW PLANNING STORIES DREAMING DREAMS OR THINKING TENDERTHOUGHTS OF THE SISTER WHO NEVER SEEMED FAR AWAY
 HER FACE LOOKED TIREDGRAVE AND RATHER SAD FOR TOMORROW WAS HER BIRTHDAY AND SHE WASTHINKING HOW FAST THE YEARS WENT BY HOW OLD SHE WAS GETTING AND HOWLITTLE SHE SEEMED TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
 ALMOST TWENTYFIVE AND NOTHINGTO SHOW FOR IT
 JO WAS MISTAKEN IN THAT THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL TO SHOWAND BY AND BY SHE SAW AND WAS GRATEFUL FOR IT
AN OLD MAID THATS WHAT IM TO BE
 A LITERARY SPINSTER WITH A PEN FORA SPOUSE A FAMILY OF STORIES FOR CHILDREN AND TWENTY YEARS HENCE AMORSEL OF FAME PERHAPS WHEN LIKE POOR JOHNSON IM OLD AND CANTENJOY IT SOLITARY AND CANT SHARE IT INDEPENDENT AND DONT NEED IT
WELL I NEEDNT BE A SOUR SAINT NOR A SELFISH SINNER AND I DARE SAYOLD MAIDS ARE VERY COMFORTABLE WHEN THEY GET USED TO IT BUT ANDTHERE JO SIGHED AS IF THE PROSPECT WAS NOT INVITING
IT SELDOM IS AT FIRST AND THIRTY SEEMS THE END OF ALL THINGS TOFIVEANDTWENTY BUT ITS NOT SO BAD AS IT LOOKS AND ONE CAN GET ONQUITE HAPPILY IF ONE HAS SOMETHING IN ONES SELF TO FALL BACK UPON

IT WAS HARD WORK BUT BETWEEN US WE TALKED HER OVER FOR WE HAD HEAPSOF GOOD REASONS ON OUR SIDE
 THERE WASNT TIME TO WRITE AND ASK LEAVEBUT YOU ALL LIKED IT HAD CONSENTED TO IT BY AND BY AND IT WAS ONLYTAKING TIME BY THE FETLOCK AS MY WIFE SAYS
ARENT WE PROUD OF THOSE TWO WORDS AND DONT WE LIKE TO SAY THEM
INTERRUPTED JO ADDRESSING THE FIRE IN HER TURN AND WATCHING WITHDELIGHT THE HAPPY LIGHT IT SEEMED TO KINDLE IN THE EYES THAT HAD BEEN SOTRAGICALLY GLOOMY WHEN SHE SAW THEM LAST
A TRIFLE PERHAPS SHES SUCH A CAPTIVATING LITTLE WOMAN I CANT HELPBEING PROUD OF HER
 WELL THEN UNCLE AND AUNT WERE THERE TO PLAYPROPRIETY WE WERE SO ABSORBED IN ONE ANOTHER WE WERE OF NO MORTAL USEAPART AND THAT CHARMING ARRANGEMENT WOULD MAKE EVERYTHING EASY ALLROUND SO WE DID IT
WHEN WHERE HOW
 ASKED JO IN A FEVER OF FEMININE INTEREST ANDCURIOSITY FOR SHE COULD NOT REALIZE IT A PARTICLE
SIX WEEKS AGO AT THE AMERICAN CONSULS IN PARIS A VERY QUIETWEDDING OF COURSE FOR EVEN IN OUR HAPPINESS WE DIDNT FORGET DEARLITTLE BETH
JO PUT HER HAND IN HIS AS HE SAID THAT AND LAURIE GENTLY SMOOTHED THELITTLE RED PILLOW WHICH HE REMEMBERED WELL

WE WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU WE THOUGHT WE WERE COMING DIRECTLY HOME ATFIRST BUT THE DEAR OLD GENTLEMAN AS SOON AS WE WERE MARRIED FOUND HECOULDNT BE READY UNDER A MONTH AT LEAST AND SENT US OFF TO SPEND OURHONEYMOON WHEREVER WE LIKED
 AMY HAD ONCE CALLED VALROSA A REGULARHONEYMOON HOME SO WE WENT THERE AND WERE AS HAPPY AS PEOPLE ARE BUTONCE IN THEIR LIVES
 MY FAITH
 WASNT IT LOVE AMONG THE ROSES
LAURIE SEEMED TO FORGET JO FOR A MINUTE AND JO WAS GLAD OF IT FOR THEFACT THAT HE TOLD HER THESE THINGS SO FREELY AND NATURALLY ASSURED HERTHAT HE HAD QUITE FORGIVEN AND FORGOTTEN
 SHE TRIED TO DRAW AWAY HERHAND BUT AS IF HE GUESSED THE THOUGHT THAT PROMPTED THEHALFINVOLUNTARY IMPULSE LAURIE HELD IT FAST AND SAID WITH A MANLYGRAVITY SHE HAD NEVER SEEN IN HIM BEFOREJO DEAR I WANT TO SAY ONE THING AND THEN WELL PUT IT BY FOREVER

DAISY FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP HER EYES OFF HER PITTY AUNTY BUTATTACHED HERSELF LIKE A LAPDOG TO THE WONDERFUL CHÂTELAINE FULL OFDELIGHTFUL CHARMS
 DEMI PAUSED TO CONSIDER THE NEW RELATIONSHIP BEFOREHE COMPROMISED HIMSELF BY THE RASH ACCEPTANCE OF A BRIBE WHICH TOOK THETEMPTING FORM OF A FAMILY OF WOODEN BEARS FROM BERNE
 A FLANK MOVEMENTPRODUCED AN UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER HOWEVER FOR LAURIE KNEW WHERE TOHAVE HIM

MERCY ON US HOW THEY DID TALK
 FIRST ONE THEN THE OTHER THEN ALLBURST OUT TOGETHER TRYING TO TELL THE HISTORY OF THREE YEARS IN HALF ANHOUR
 IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT TEA WAS AT HAND TO PRODUCE A LULL ANDPROVIDE REFRESHMENT FOR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HOARSE AND FAINT IF THEYHAD GONE ON MUCH LONGER
 SUCH A HAPPY PROCESSION AS FILED AWAY INTO THELITTLE DININGROOM
 MR

THE TWINS PRANCED BEHIND FEELING THAT THE MILLENNIUM WAS AT HAND FOREVERY ONE WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NEWCOMERS THAT THEY WERE LEFT TO REVELAT THEIR OWN SWEET WILL AND YOU MAY BE SURE THEY MADE THE MOST OF THEOPPORTUNITY
 DIDNT THEY STEAL SIPS OF TEA STUFF GINGERBREAD ABLIBITUM GET A HOT BISCUIT APIECE AND AS A CROWNING TRESPASS DIDNTTHEY EACH WHISK A CAPTIVATING LITTLE TART INTO THEIR TINY POCKETS THERETO STICK AND CRUMBLE TREACHEROUSLY TEACHING THEM THAT BOTH HUMAN NATUREAND PASTRY ARE FRAIL
 BURDENED WITH THE GUILTY CONSCIOUSNESS OF THESEQUESTERED TARTS AND FEARING THAT DODOS SHARP EYES WOULD PIERCE THETHIN DISGUISE OF CAMBRIC AND MERINO WHICH HID THEIR BOOTY THE LITTLESINNERS ATTACHED THEMSELVES TO DRANPA WHO HADNT HIS SPECTACLES ON
AMY WHO WAS HANDED ABOUT LIKE REFRESHMENTS RETURNED TO THE PARLOR ONFATHER LAURENCES ARM THE OTHERS PAIRED OFF AS BEFORE AND THISARRANGEMENT LEFT JO COMPANIONLESS
 SHE DID NOT MIND IT AT THE MINUTEFOR SHE LINGERED TO ANSWER HANNAHS EAGER INQUIRYWILL MISS AMY RIDE IN HER COOP COUPÉ AND USE ALL THEM LOVELYSILVER DISHES THATS STORED AWAY OVER YANDER
SHOULDNT WONDER IF SHE DROVE SIX WHITE HORSES ATE OFF GOLD PLATE ANDWORE DIAMONDS AND POINTLACE EVERY DAY
 TEDDY THINKS NOTHING TOO GOODFOR HER RETURNED JO WITH INFINITE SATISFACTION
NO MORE THERE IS
 WILL YOU HAVE HASH OR FISHBALLS FOR BREAKFAST
ASKED HANNAH WHO WISELY MINGLED POETRY AND PROSE
I DONT CARE AND JO SHUT THE DOOR FEELING THAT FOOD WAS ANUNCONGENIAL TOPIC JUST THEN
 SHE STOOD A MINUTE LOOKING AT THE PARTYVANISHING ABOVE AND AS DEMIS SHORT PLAID LEGS TOILED UP THE LASTSTAIR A SUDDEN SENSE OF LONELINESS CAME OVER HER SO STRONGLY THAT SHELOOKED ABOUT HER WITH DIM EYES AS IF TO FIND SOMETHING TO LEAN UPONFOR EVEN TEDDY HAD DESERTED HER
 IF SHE HAD KNOWN WHAT BIRTHDAY GIFT WASCOMING EVERY MINUTE NEARER AND NEARER SHE WOULD NOT HAVE SAID TOHERSELF ILL WEEP A LITTLE WEEP WHEN I GO TO BED IT WONT DO TO BEDISMAL NOW
 THEN SHE DREW HER HAND OVER HER EYESFOR ONE OF HERBOYISH HABITS WAS NEVER TO KNOW WHERE HER HANDKERCHIEF WASAND HADJUST MANAGED TO CALL UP A SMILE WHEN THERE CAME A KNOCK AT THEPORCHDOOR
SHE OPENED IT WITH HOSPITABLE HASTE AND STARTED AS IF ANOTHER GHOST HADCOME TO SURPRISE HER FOR THERE STOOD A TALL BEARDED GENTLEMAN BEAMINGON HER FROM THE DARKNESS LIKE A MIDNIGHT SUN
O MR
 BHAER I AM SO GLAD TO SEE YOU
 CRIED JO WITH A CLUTCH AS IFSHE FEARED THE NIGHT WOULD SWALLOW HIM UP BEFORE SHE COULD GET HIM IN
          ILLUSTRATION O MR
 BHAER I AM SO GLAD TO SEE YOUAND I TO SEE MISS MARSCHBUT NO YOU HAF A PARTY AND THE PROFESSORPAUSED AS THE SOUND OF VOICES AND THE TAP OF DANCING FEET CAME DOWN TOTHEM
NO WE HAVENT ONLY THE FAMILY
 MY SISTER AND FRIENDS HAVE JUST COMEHOME AND WE ARE ALL VERY HAPPY
 COME IN AND MAKE ONE OF US
THOUGH A VERY SOCIAL MAN I THINK MR
 BHAER WOULD HAVE GONE DECOROUSLYAWAY AND COME AGAIN ANOTHER DAY BUT HOW COULD HE WHEN JO SHUT THEDOOR BEHIND HIM AND BEREFT HIM OF HIS HAT
 PERHAPS HER FACE HADSOMETHING TO DO WITH IT FOR SHE FORGOT TO HIDE HER JOY AT SEEING HIMAND SHOWED IT WITH A FRANKNESS THAT PROVED IRRESISTIBLE TO THE SOLITARYMAN WHOSE WELCOME FAR EXCEEDED HIS BOLDEST HOPES
IF I SHALL NOT BE MONSIEUR DE TROP I WILL SO GLADLY SEE THEM ALL
 YOUHAF BEEN ILL MY FRIEND
HE PUT THE QUESTION ABRUPTLY FOR AS JO HUNG UP HIS COAT THE LIGHTFELL ON HER FACE AND HE SAW A CHANGE IN IT
NOT ILL BUT TIRED AND SORROWFUL
 WE HAVE HAD TROUBLE SINCE I SAW YOULAST
AH YES I KNOW
 MY HEART WAS SORE FOR YOU WHEN I HEARD THAT AND HESHOOK HANDS AGAIN WITH SUCH A SYMPATHETIC FACE THAT JO FELT AS IF NOCOMFORT COULD EQUAL THE LOOK OF THE KIND EYES THE GRASP OF THE BIGWARM HAND
FATHER MOTHER THIS IS MY FRIEND PROFESSOR BHAER SHE SAID WITH AFACE AND TONE OF SUCH IRREPRESSIBLE PRIDE AND PLEASURE THAT SHE MIGHT ASWELL HAVE BLOWN A TRUMPET AND OPENED THE DOOR WITH A FLOURISH
IF THE STRANGER HAD HAD ANY DOUBTS ABOUT HIS RECEPTION THEY WERE SET ATREST IN A MINUTE BY THE CORDIAL WELCOME HE RECEIVED
 EVERY ONE GREETEDHIM KINDLY FOR JOS SAKE AT FIRST BUT VERY SOON THEY LIKED HIM FOR HISOWN
 THEY COULD NOT HELP IT FOR HE CARRIED THE TALISMAN THAT OPENS ALLHEARTS AND THESE SIMPLE PEOPLE WARMED TO HIM AT ONCE FEELING EVEN THEMORE FRIENDLY BECAUSE HE WAS POOR FOR POVERTY ENRICHES THOSE WHO LIVEABOVE IT AND IS A SURE PASSPORT TO TRULY HOSPITABLE SPIRITS
 MR
 BHAERSAT LOOKING ABOUT HIM WITH THE AIR OF A TRAVELLER WHO KNOCKS AT ASTRANGE DOOR AND WHEN IT OPENS FINDS HIMSELF AT HOME
 THE CHILDRENWENT TO HIM LIKE BEES TO A HONEYPOT AND ESTABLISHING THEMSELVES ONEACH KNEE PROCEEDED TO CAPTIVATE HIM BY RIFLING HIS POCKETS PULLINGHIS BEARD AND INVESTIGATING HIS WATCH WITH JUVENILE AUDACITY
 THEWOMEN TELEGRAPHED THEIR APPROVAL TO ONE ANOTHER AND MR
 MARCH FEELINGTHAT HE HAD GOT A KINDRED SPIRIT OPENED HIS CHOICEST STORES FOR HISGUESTS BENEFIT WHILE SILENT JOHN LISTENED AND ENJOYED THE TALK BUTSAID NOT A WORD AND MR
 LAURENCE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GO TO SLEEP
IF JO HAD NOT BEEN OTHERWISE ENGAGED LAURIES BEHAVIOR WOULD HAVEAMUSED HER FOR A FAINT TWINGE NOT OF JEALOUSY BUT SOMETHING LIKESUSPICION CAUSED THAT GENTLEMAN TO STAND ALOOF AT FIRST AND OBSERVETHE NEWCOMER WITH BROTHERLY CIRCUMSPECTION
 BUT IT DID NOT LAST LONG
HE GOT INTERESTED IN SPITE OF HIMSELF AND BEFORE HE KNEW IT WAS DRAWNINTO THE CIRCLE FOR MR
 BHAER TALKED WELL IN THIS GENIAL ATMOSPHEREAND DID HIMSELF JUSTICE
 HE SELDOM SPOKE TO LAURIE BUT HE LOOKED AT HIMOFTEN AND A SHADOW WOULD PASS ACROSS HIS FACE AS IF REGRETTING HIS OWNLOST YOUTH AS HE WATCHED THE YOUNG MAN IN HIS PRIME
 THEN HIS EYE WOULDTURN TO JO SO WISTFULLY THAT SHE WOULD HAVE SURELY ANSWERED THE MUTEINQUIRY IF SHE HAD SEEN IT BUT JO HAD HER OWN EYES TO TAKE CARE OFAND FEELING THAT THEY COULD NOT BE TRUSTED SHE PRUDENTLY KEPT THEM ONTHE LITTLE SOCK SHE WAS KNITTING LIKE A MODEL MAIDEN AUNT
A STEALTHY GLANCE NOW AND THEN REFRESHED HER LIKE SIPS OF FRESH WATERAFTER A DUSTY WALK FOR THE SIDELONG PEEPS SHOWED HER SEVERAL PROPITIOUSOMENS
 MR
 BHAERS FACE HAD LOST THE ABSENTMINDED EXPRESSION ANDLOOKED ALL ALIVE WITH INTEREST IN THE PRESENT MOMENT ACTUALLY YOUNG ANDHANDSOME SHE THOUGHT FORGETTING TO COMPARE HIM WITH LAURIE AS SHEUSUALLY DID STRANGE MEN TO THEIR GREAT DETRIMENT
 THEN HE SEEMED QUITEINSPIRED THOUGH THE BURIAL CUSTOMS OF THE ANCIENTS TO WHICH THECONVERSATION HAD STRAYED MIGHT NOT BE CONSIDERED AN EXHILARATING TOPIC
JO QUITE GLOWED WITH TRIUMPH WHEN TEDDY GOT QUENCHED IN AN ARGUMENT ANDTHOUGHT TO HERSELF AS SHE WATCHED HER FATHERS ABSORBED FACE HOW HEWOULD ENJOY HAVING SUCH A MAN AS MY PROFESSOR TO TALK WITH EVERY DAY
LASTLY MR
 BHAER WAS DRESSED IN A NEW SUIT OF BLACK WHICH MADE HIMLOOK MORE LIKE A GENTLEMAN THAN EVER
 HIS BUSHY HAIR HAD BEEN CUT ANDSMOOTHLY BRUSHED BUT DIDNT STAY IN ORDER LONG FOR IN EXCITINGMOMENTS HE RUMPLED IT UP IN THE DROLL WAY HE USED TO DO AND JO LIKEDIT RAMPANTLY ERECT BETTER THAN FLAT BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT IT GAVE HISFINE FOREHEAD A JOVELIKE ASPECT
 POOR JO HOW SHE DID GLORIFY THATPLAIN MAN AS SHE SAT KNITTING AWAY SO QUIETLY YET LETTING NOTHINGESCAPE HER NOT EVEN THE FACT THAT MR
 BHAER ACTUALLY HAD GOLDSLEEVEBUTTONS IN HIS IMMACULATE WRISTBANDS
DEAR OLD FELLOW
 HE COULDNT HAVE GOT HIMSELF UP WITH MORE CARE IF HEDBEEN GOING AWOOING SAID JO TO HERSELF AND THEN A SUDDEN THOUGHTBORN OF THE WORDS MADE HER BLUSH SO DREADFULLY THAT SHE HAD TO DROP HERBALL AND GO DOWN AFTER IT TO HIDE HER FACE
THE MANŒUVRE DID NOT SUCCEED AS WELL AS SHE EXPECTED HOWEVER FORTHOUGH JUST IN THE ACT OF SETTING FIRE TO A FUNERALPILE THE PROFESSORDROPPED HIS TORCH METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING AND MADE A DIVE AFTER THELITTLE BLUE BALL
 OF COURSE THEY BUMPED THEIR HEADS SMARTLY TOGETHERSAW STARS AND BOTH CAME UP FLUSHED AND LAUGHING WITHOUT THE BALL TORESUME THEIR SEATS WISHING THEY HAD NOT LEFT THEM
NOBODY KNEW WHERE THE EVENING WENT TO FOR HANNAH SKILFULLY ABSTRACTEDTHE BABIES AT AN EARLY HOUR NODDING LIKE TWO ROSY POPPIES AND MR
LAURENCE WENT HOME TO REST
 THE OTHERS SAT ROUND THE FIRE TALKINGAWAY UTTERLY REGARDLESS OF THE LAPSE OF TIME TILL MEG WHOSE MATERNALMIND WAS IMPRESSED WITH A FIRM CONVICTION THAT DAISY HAD TUMBLED OUT OFBED AND DEMI SET HIS NIGHTGOWN AFIRE STUDYING THE STRUCTURE OFMATCHES MADE A MOVE TO GO
WE MUST HAVE OUR SING IN THE GOOD OLD WAY FOR WE ARE ALL TOGETHERAGAIN ONCE MORE SAID JO FEELING THAT A GOOD SHOUT WOULD BE A SAFE ANDPLEASANT VENT FOR THE JUBILANT EMOTIONS OF HER SOUL
THEY WERE NOT ALL THERE
 BUT NO ONE FOUND THE WORDS THOUGHTLESS ORUNTRUE FOR BETH STILL SEEMED AMONG THEM A PEACEFUL PRESENCEINVISIBLE BUT DEARER THAN EVER SINCE DEATH COULD NOT BREAK THEHOUSEHOLD LEAGUE THAT LOVE MADE INDISSOLUBLE
 THE LITTLE CHAIR STOOD INITS OLD PLACE THE TIDY BASKET WITH THE BIT OF WORK SHE LEFT UNFINISHEDWHEN THE NEEDLE GREW SO HEAVY WAS STILL ON ITS ACCUSTOMED SHELF THEBELOVED INSTRUMENT SELDOM TOUCHED NOW HAD NOT BEEN MOVED AND ABOVE ITBETHS FACE SERENE AND SMILING AS IN THE EARLY DAYS LOOKED DOWN UPONTHEM SEEMING TO SAY BE HAPPY
 I AM HERE
PLAY SOMETHING AMY
 LET THEM HEAR HOW MUCH YOU HAVE IMPROVED SAIDLAURIE WITH PARDONABLE PRIDE IN HIS PROMISING PUPIL
BUT AMY WHISPERED WITH FULL EYES AS SHE TWIRLED THE FADED STOOLNOT TONIGHT DEAR
 I CANT SHOW OFF TONIGHT
BUT SHE DID SHOW SOMETHING BETTER THAN BRILLIANCY OR SKILL FOR SHE SUNGBETHS SONGS WITH A TENDER MUSIC IN HER VOICE WHICH THE BEST MASTERCOULD NOT HAVE TAUGHT AND TOUCHED THE LISTENERS HEARTS WITH A SWEETERPOWER THAN ANY OTHER INSPIRATION COULD HAVE GIVEN HER
 THE ROOM WAS VERYSTILL WHEN THE CLEAR VOICE FAILED SUDDENLY AT THE LAST LINE OF BETHSFAVORITE HYMN
 IT WAS HARD TO SAY        EARTH HATH NO SORROW THAT HEAVEN CANNOT HEALAND AMY LEANED AGAINST HER HUSBAND WHO STOOD BEHIND HER FEELING THATHER WELCOME HOME WAS NOT QUITE PERFECT WITHOUT BETHS KISS
NOW WE MUST FINISH WITH MIGNONS SONG FOR MR
 BHAER SINGS THAT SAIDJO BEFORE THE PAUSE GREW PAINFUL
 AND MR
 BHAER CLEARED HIS THROAT WITHA GRATIFIED HEM
 AS HE STEPPED INTO THE CORNER WHERE JO STOODSAYINGYOU WILL SING WITH ME
 WE GO EXCELLENTLY WELL TOGETHER
A PLEASING FICTION BY THE WAY FOR JO HAD NO MORE IDEA OF MUSIC THAN AGRASSHOPPER
 BUT SHE WOULD HAVE CONSENTED IF HE HAD PROPOSED TO SING AWHOLE OPERA AND WARBLED AWAY BLISSFULLY REGARDLESS OF TIME AND TUNE
IT DIDNT MUCH MATTER FOR MR
 BHAER SANG LIKE A TRUE GERMAN HEARTILYAND WELL AND JO SOON SUBSIDED INTO A SUBDUED HUM THAT SHE MIGHT LISTENTO THE MELLOW VOICE THAT SEEMED TO SING FOR HER ALONE
                ILLUSTRATION MR
 BHAER SANG HEARTILY        KNOWST THOU THE LAND WHERE THE CITRON BLOOMSUSED TO BE THE PROFESSORS FAVORITE LINE FOR DAS LAND MEANT GERMANYTO HIM BUT NOW HE SEEMED TO DWELL WITH PECULIAR WARMTH AND MELODYUPON THE WORDS        THERE OH THERE MIGHT I WITH THEE         O MY BELOVED GO
AND ONE LISTENER WAS SO THRILLED BY THE TENDER INVITATION THAT SHELONGED TO SAY SHE DID KNOW THE LAND AND WOULD JOYFULLY DEPART THITHERWHENEVER HE LIKED
THE SONG WAS CONSIDERED A GREAT SUCCESS AND THE SINGER RETIRED COVEREDWITH LAURELS
 BUT A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARD HE FORGOT HIS MANNERSENTIRELY AND STARED AT AMY PUTTING ON HER BONNET FOR SHE HAD BEENINTRODUCED SIMPLY AS MY SISTER AND NO ONE HAD CALLED HER BY HER NEWNAME SINCE HE CAME
 HE FORGOT HIMSELF STILL FURTHER WHEN LAURIE SAID INHIS MOST GRACIOUS MANNER AT PARTINGMY WIFE AND I ARE VERY GLAD TO MEET YOU SIR
 PLEASE REMEMBER THATTHERE IS ALWAYS A WELCOME WAITING FOR YOU OVER THE WAY
THEN THE PROFESSOR THANKED HIM SO HEARTILY AND LOOKED SO SUDDENLYILLUMINATED WITH SATISFACTION THAT LAURIE THOUGHT HIM THE MOSTDELIGHTFULLY DEMONSTRATIVE OLD FELLOW HE EVER MET
I TOO SHALL GO BUT I SHALL GLADLY COME AGAIN IF YOU WILL GIF MELEAVE DEAR MADAME FOR A LITTLE BUSINESS IN THE CITY WILL KEEP ME HERESOME DAYS
HE SPOKE TO MRS

SHE WONDERED WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS THAT BROUGHT MR
 BHAER TO THE CITYAND FINALLY DECIDED THAT HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO SOME GREAT HONORSOMEWHERE BUT HAD BEEN TOO MODEST TO MENTION THE FACT
 IF SHE HAD SEENHIS FACE WHEN SAFE IN HIS OWN ROOM HE LOOKED AT THE PICTURE OF ASEVERE AND RIGID YOUNG LADY WITH A GOOD DEAL OF HAIR WHO APPEARED TOBE GAZING DARKLY INTO FUTURITY IT MIGHT HAVE THROWN SOME LIGHT UPON THESUBJECT ESPECIALLY WHEN HE TURNED OFF THE GAS AND KISSED THE PICTUREIN THE DARK

 I MUST SAY I LIKE TO SERVE A DECAYED GENTLEMAN BETTER THAN ABLARNEYING BEGGAR I SUPPOSE ITS WRONG BUT I DO THOUGH IT ISHARDER

 SPLENDID FELLOWS SOMEOF THEM WORKING LIKE HEROES POOR AND FRIENDLESS BUT SO FULL OFCOURAGE PATIENCE AND AMBITION THAT I WAS ASHAMED OF MYSELF ANDLONGED TO GIVE THEM A RIGHT GOOD LIFT

                            DAISY AND DEMI
I CANNOT FEEL THAT I HAVE DONE MY DUTY AS HUMBLE HISTORIAN OF THE MARCHFAMILY WITHOUT DEVOTING AT LEAST ONE CHAPTER TO THE TWO MOST PRECIOUSAND IMPORTANT MEMBERS OF IT
 DAISY AND DEMI HAD NOW ARRIVED AT YEARS OFDISCRETION FOR IN THIS FAST AGE BABIES OF THREE OR FOUR ASSERT THEIRRIGHTS AND GET THEM TOO WHICH IS MORE THAN MANY OF THEIR ELDERS DO
IF THERE EVER WERE A PAIR OF TWINS IN DANGER OF BEING UTTERLY SPOILT BYADORATION IT WAS THESE PRATTLING BROOKES
 OF COURSE THEY WERE THE MOSTREMARKABLE CHILDREN EVER BORN AS WILL BE SHOWN WHEN I MENTION THAT THEYWALKED AT EIGHT MONTHS TALKED FLUENTLY AT TWELVE MONTHS AND AT TWOYEARS THEY TOOK THEIR PLACES AT TABLE AND BEHAVED WITH A PROPRIETYWHICH CHARMED ALL BEHOLDERS
 AT THREE DAISY DEMANDED A NEEDLER ANDACTUALLY MADE A BAG WITH FOUR STITCHES IN IT SHE LIKEWISE SET UPHOUSEKEEPING IN THE SIDEBOARD AND MANAGED A MICROSCOPIC COOKINGSTOVEWITH A SKILL THAT BROUGHT TEARS OF PRIDE TO HANNAHS EYES WHILE DEMILEARNED HIS LETTERS WITH HIS GRANDFATHER WHO INVENTED A NEW MODE OFTEACHING THE ALPHABET BY FORMING THE LETTERS WITH HIS ARMS AND LEGSTHUS UNITING GYMNASTICS FOR HEAD AND HEELS
 THE BOY EARLY DEVELOPED AMECHANICAL GENIUS WHICH DELIGHTED HIS FATHER AND DISTRACTED HIS MOTHERFOR HE TRIED TO IMITATE EVERY MACHINE HE SAW AND KEPT THE NURSERY IN ACHAOTIC CONDITION WITH HIS SEWINSHEENA MYSTERIOUS STRUCTURE OFSTRING CHAIRS CLOTHESPINS AND SPOOLS FOR WHEELS TO GO WOUND ANDWOUND ALSO A BASKET HUNG OVER THE BACK OF A BIG CHAIR IN WHICH HEVAINLY TRIED TO HOIST HIS TOO CONFIDING SISTER WHO WITH FEMININEDEVOTION ALLOWED HER LITTLE HEAD TO BE BUMPED TILL RESCUED WHEN THEYOUNG INVENTOR INDIGNANTLY REMARKED WHY MARMAR DATS MY LELLYWAITERAND MES TRYING TO PULL HER UP
THOUGH UTTERLY UNLIKE IN CHARACTER THE TWINS GOT ON REMARKABLY WELLTOGETHER AND SELDOM QUARRELLED MORE THAN THRICE A DAY
 OF COURSE DEMITYRANNIZED OVER DAISY AND GALLANTLY DEFENDED HER FROM EVERY OTHERAGGRESSOR WHILE DAISY MADE A GALLEYSLAVE OF HERSELF AND ADORED HERBROTHER AS THE ONE PERFECT BEING IN THE WORLD
 A ROSY CHUBBY SUNSHINYLITTLE SOUL WAS DAISY WHO FOUND HER WAY TO EVERYBODYS HEART ANDNESTLED THERE
 ONE OF THE CAPTIVATING CHILDREN WHO SEEM MADE TO BEKISSED AND CUDDLED ADORNED AND ADORED LIKE LITTLE GODDESSES ANDPRODUCED FOR GENERAL APPROVAL ON ALL FESTIVE OCCASIONS
 HER SMALLVIRTUES WERE SO SWEET THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE ANGELIC IF A FEWSMALL NAUGHTINESSES HAD NOT KEPT HER DELIGHTFULLY HUMAN
 IT WAS ALL FAIRWEATHER IN HER WORLD AND EVERY MORNING SHE SCRAMBLED UP TO THE WINDOWIN HER LITTLE NIGHTGOWN TO LOOK OUT AND SAY NO MATTER WHETHER ITRAINED OR SHONE OH PITTY DAY OH PITTY DAY
 EVERY ONE WAS A FRIENDAND SHE OFFERED KISSES TO A STRANGER SO CONFIDINGLY THAT THE MOSTINVETERATE BACHELOR RELENTED AND BABYLOVERS BECAME FAITHFULWORSHIPPERS
                   ILLUSTRATION ME LOVES EVVYBODYME LOVES EVVYBODY SHE ONCE SAID OPENING HER ARMS WITH HER SPOON INONE HAND AND HER MUG IN THE OTHER AS IF EAGER TO EMBRACE AND NOURISHTHE WHOLE WORLD
AS SHE GREW HER MOTHER BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THE DOVECOTE WOULD BE BLESTBY THE PRESENCE OF AN INMATE AS SERENE AND LOVING AS THAT WHICH HADHELPED TO MAKE THE OLD HOUSE HOME AND TO PRAY THAT SHE MIGHT BE SPAREDA LOSS LIKE THAT WHICH HAD LATELY TAUGHT THEM HOW LONG THEY HADENTERTAINED AN ANGEL UNAWARES
 HER GRANDFATHER OFTEN CALLED HER BETHAND HER GRANDMOTHER WATCHED OVER HER WITH UNTIRING DEVOTION AS IFTRYING TO ATONE FOR SOME PAST MISTAKE WHICH NO EYE BUT HER OWN COULDSEE
DEMI LIKE A TRUE YANKEE WAS OF AN INQUIRING TURN WANTING TO KNOWEVERYTHING AND OFTEN GETTING MUCH DISTURBED BECAUSE HE COULD NOT GETSATISFACTORY ANSWERS TO HIS PERPETUAL WHAT FOR
HE ALSO POSSESSED A PHILOSOPHIC BENT TO THE GREAT DELIGHT OF HISGRANDFATHER WHO USED TO HOLD SOCRATIC CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM IN WHICHTHE PRECOCIOUS PUPIL OCCASIONALLY POSED HIS TEACHER TO THE UNDISGUISEDSATISFACTION OF THE WOMENFOLK
             ILLUSTRATION WHAT MAKES MY LEGS GO DRANPA

 ASKED THE YOUNG PHILOSOPHER SURVEYINGTHOSE ACTIVE PORTIONS OF HIS FRAME WITH A MEDITATIVE AIR WHILE RESTINGAFTER A GOTOBED FROLIC ONE NIGHT
ITS YOUR LITTLE MIND DEMI REPLIED THE SAGE STROKING THE YELLOWHEAD RESPECTFULLY
WHAT IS A LITTLE MINE
IT IS SOMETHING WHICH MAKES YOUR BODY MOVE AS THE SPRING MADE THEWHEELS GO IN MY WATCH WHEN I SHOWED IT TO YOU
OPEN ME I WANT TO SEE IT GO WOUND
I CANT DO THAT ANY MORE THAN YOU COULD OPEN THE WATCH
 GOD WINDS YOUUP AND YOU GO TILL HE STOPS YOU
DOES I
 AND DEMIS BROWN EYES GREW BIG AND BRIGHT AS HE TOOK IN THENEW THOUGHT
 IS I WOUNDED UP LIKE THE WATCH
YES BUT I CANT SHOW YOU HOW FOR IT IS DONE WHEN WE DONT SEE
DEMI FELT OF HIS BACK AS IF EXPECTING TO FIND IT LIKE THAT OF THEWATCH AND THEN GRAVELY REMARKEDI DESS DOD DOES IT WHEN IS ASLEEP
A CAREFUL EXPLANATION FOLLOWED TO WHICH HE LISTENED SO ATTENTIVELY THATHIS ANXIOUS GRANDMOTHER SAIDMY DEAR DO YOU THINK IT WISE TO TALK ABOUT SUCH THINGS TO THAT BABY
HES GETTING GREAT BUMPS OVER HIS EYES AND LEARNING TO ASK THE MOSTUNANSWERABLE QUESTIONS
IF HE IS OLD ENOUGH TO ASK THE QUESTIONS HE IS OLD ENOUGH TO RECEIVETRUE ANSWERS
 I AM NOT PUTTING THE THOUGHTS INTO HIS HEAD BUT HELPINGHIM UNFOLD THOSE ALREADY THERE
 THESE CHILDREN ARE WISER THAN WE AREAND I HAVE NO DOUBT THE BOY UNDERSTANDS EVERY WORD I HAVE SAID TO HIM
NOW DEMI TELL ME WHERE YOU KEEP YOUR MIND
IF THE BOY HAD REPLIED LIKE ALCIBIADES BY THE GODS SOCRATES I CANNOTTELL HIS GRANDFATHER WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BUT WHEN AFTERSTANDING A MOMENT ON ONE LEG LIKE A MEDITATIVE YOUNG STORK HEANSWERED IN A TONE OF CALM CONVICTION IN MY LITTLE BELLY THE OLDGENTLEMAN COULD ONLY JOIN IN GRANDMAS LAUGH AND DISMISS THE CLASS INMETAPHYSICS
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CAUSE FOR MATERNAL ANXIETY IF DEMI HAD NOT GIVENCONVINCING PROOFS THAT HE WAS A TRUE BOY AS WELL AS A BUDDINGPHILOSOPHER FOR OFTEN AFTER A DISCUSSION WHICH CAUSED HANNAH TOPROPHESY WITH OMINOUS NODS THAT CHILD AINT LONG FOR THIS WORLD HEWOULD TURN ABOUT AND SET HER FEARS AT REST BY SOME OF THE PRANKS WITHWHICH DEAR DIRTY NAUGHTY LITTLE RASCALS DISTRACT AND DELIGHT THEIRPARENTS SOULS
MEG MADE MANY MORAL RULES AND TRIED TO KEEP THEM BUT WHAT MOTHER WASEVER PROOF AGAINST THE WINNING WILES THE INGENIOUS EVASIONS OR THETRANQUIL AUDACITY OF THE MINIATURE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SO EARLY SHOWTHEMSELVES ACCOMPLISHED ARTFUL DODGERS

I DONT WANT TO HAVE YOU SO RUN AWAY AND HELP DAISY MAKE PATTYCAKES
HE RELUCTANTLY DEPARTS BUT HIS WRONGS WEIGH UPON HIS SPIRIT AND BYAND BY WHEN AN OPPORTUNITY COMES TO REDRESS THEM HE OUTWITS MAMMA BY ASHREWD BARGAIN
NOW YOU HAVE BEEN GOOD CHILDREN AND ILL PLAY ANYTHING YOU LIKE SAYSMEG AS SHE LEADS HER ASSISTANT COOKS UPSTAIRS WHEN THE PUDDING ISSAFELY BOUNCING IN THE POT

 BUT WHEN MR
 BHAER CAME JONEGLECTED HER PLAYFELLOWS AND DISMAY AND DESOLATION FELL UPON THEIRLITTLE SOULS
 DAISY WHO WAS FOND OF GOING ABOUT PEDDLING KISSES LOSTHER BEST CUSTOMER AND BECAME BANKRUPT DEMI WITH INFANTILE PENETRATIONSOON DISCOVERED THAT DODO LIKED TO PLAY WITH THE BEARMAN BETTER THANSHE DID WITH HIM BUT THOUGH HURT HE CONCEALED HIS ANGUISH FOR HEHADNT THE HEART TO INSULT A RIVAL WHO KEPT A MINE OF CHOCOLATEDROPS INHIS WAISTCOATPOCKET AND A WATCH THAT COULD BE TAKEN OUT OF ITS CASEAND FREELY SHAKEN BY ARDENT ADMIRERS
SOME PERSONS MIGHT HAVE CONSIDERED THESE PLEASING LIBERTIES AS BRIBESBUT DEMI DIDNT SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT AND CONTINUED TO PATRONIZE THEBEARMAN WITH PENSIVE AFFABILITY WHILE DAISY BESTOWED HER SMALLAFFECTIONS UPON HIM AT THE THIRD CALL AND CONSIDERED HIS SHOULDER HERTHRONE HIS ARM HER REFUGE HIS GIFTS TREASURES OF SURPASSING WORTH
GENTLEMEN ARE SOMETIMES SEIZED WITH SUDDEN FITS OF ADMIRATION FOR THEYOUNG RELATIVES OF LADIES WHOM THEY HONOR WITH THEIR REGARD BUT THISCOUNTERFEIT PHILOPROGENITIVENESS SITS UNEASILY UPON THEM AND DOES NOTDECEIVE ANYBODY A PARTICLE

 IT WAS DREADFUL BUT SHE WOULD HAVE DONE IT IF THEFLOCK OF DRAGGLETAILED SPARROWS ON THE HEDGE HAD BEEN HUMAN BEINGS FORSHE WAS VERY FAR GONE INDEED AND QUITE REGARDLESS OF EVERYTHING BUT HEROWN HAPPINESS
 THOUGH IT CAME IN SUCH A VERY SIMPLE GUISE THAT WAS THECROWNING MOMENT OF BOTH THEIR LIVES WHEN TURNING FROM THE NIGHT ANDSTORM AND LONELINESS TO THE HOUSEHOLD LIGHT AND WARMTH AND PEACE WAITINGTO RECEIVE THEM WITH A GLAD WELCOME HOME

I DONT SEE ANYTHING FUNNY SHE SAID GRAVELY WHEN SHE COULD BE HEARD
NOTHING COULD BE MORE NATURAL OR PROPER THAN FOR MY PROFESSOR TO OPEN ASCHOOL AND FOR ME TO PREFER TO RESIDE ON MY OWN ESTATE
SHE IS PUTTING ON AIRS ALREADY SAID LAURIE WHO REGARDED THE IDEA INTHE LIGHT OF A CAPITAL JOKE
 BUT MAY I INQUIRE HOW YOU INTEND TOSUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT
 IF ALL THE PUPILS ARE LITTLE RAGAMUFFINS IMAFRAID YOUR CROP WONT BE PROFITABLE IN A WORLDLY SENSE MRS
 BHAER
NOW DONT BE A WETBLANKET TEDDY
 OF COURSE I SHALL HAVE RICH PUPILSALSOPERHAPS BEGIN WITH SUCH ALTOGETHER THEN WHEN IVE GOT A STARTI CAN TAKE A RAGAMUFFIN OR TWO JUST FOR A RELISH
 RICH PEOPLESCHILDREN OFTEN NEED CARE AND COMFORT AS WELL AS POOR
 IVE SEENUNFORTUNATE LITTLE CREATURES LEFT TO SERVANTS OR BACKWARD ONES PUSHEDFORWARD WHEN ITS REAL CRUELTY
 SOME ARE NAUGHTY THROUGH MISMANAGEMENTOR NEGLECT AND SOME LOSE THEIR MOTHERS
 BESIDES THE BEST HAVE TO GETTHROUGH THE HOBBLEDEHOY AGE AND THATS THE VERY TIME THEY NEED MOSTPATIENCE AND KINDNESS
 PEOPLE LAUGH AT THEM AND HUSTLE THEM ABOUT TRYTO KEEP THEM OUT OF SIGHT AND EXPECT THEM TO TURN ALL AT ONCE FROMPRETTY CHILDREN INTO FINE YOUNG MEN
 THEY DONT COMPLAIN MUCHPLUCKYLITTLE SOULSBUT THEY FEEL IT
 IVE BEEN THROUGH SOMETHING OF IT ANDI KNOW ALL ABOUT IT
 IVE A SPECIAL INTEREST IN SUCH YOUNG BEARS ANDLIKE TO SHOW THEM THAT I SEE THE WARM HONEST WELLMEANING BOYSHEARTS IN SPITE OF THE CLUMSY ARMS AND LEGS AND THE TOPSYTURVY HEADS

I DO THINK THAT FAMILIES ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN ALL THEWORLD
 BURST OUT JO WHO WAS IN AN UNUSUALLY UPLIFTED FRAME OF MINDJUST THEN
 WHEN I HAVE ONE OF MY OWN I HOPE IT WILL BE AS HAPPY AS THETHREE I KNOW AND LOVE THE BEST
 IF JOHN AND MY FRITZ WERE ONLY HERE ITWOULD BE QUITE A LITTLE HEAVEN ON EARTH SHE ADDED MORE QUIETLY
 ANDTHAT NIGHT WHEN SHE WENT TO HER ROOM AFTER A BLISSFUL EVENING OFFAMILY COUNSELS HOPES AND PLANS HER HEART WAS SO FULL OF HAPPINESSTHAT SHE COULD ONLY CALM IT BY KNEELING BESIDE THE EMPTY BED ALWAYS NEARHER OWN AND THINKING TENDER THOUGHTS OF BETH
IT WAS A VERY ASTONISHING YEAR ALTOGETHER FOR THINGS SEEMED TO HAPPENIN AN UNUSUALLY RAPID AND DELIGHTFUL MANNER
 ALMOST BEFORE SHE KNEWWHERE SHE WAS JO FOUND HERSELF MARRIED AND SETTLED AT PLUMFIELD
 THEN AFAMILY OF SIX OR SEVEN BOYS SPRUNG UP LIKE MUSHROOMS AND FLOURISHEDSURPRISINGLY POOR BOYS AS WELL AS RICH FOR MR
 LAURENCE WASCONTINUALLY FINDING SOME TOUCHING CASE OF DESTITUTION AND BEGGING THEBHAERS TO TAKE PITY ON THE CHILD AND HE WOULD GLADLY PAY A TRIFLE FORITS SUPPORT
 IN THIS WAY THE SLY OLD GENTLEMAN GOT ROUND PROUD JO ANDFURNISHED HER WITH THE STYLE OF BOY IN WHICH SHE MOST DELIGHTED
OF COURSE IT WAS UPHILL WORK AT FIRST AND JO MADE QUEER MISTAKES BUTTHE WISE PROFESSOR STEERED HER SAFELY INTO CALMER WATERS AND THE MOSTRAMPANT RAGAMUFFIN WAS CONQUERED IN THE END
 HOW JO DID ENJOY HERWILDERNESS OF BOYS AND HOW POOR DEAR AUNT MARCH WOULD HAVE LAMENTEDHAD SHE BEEN THERE TO SEE THE SACRED PRECINCTS OF PRIM WELLORDEREDPLUMFIELD OVERRUN WITH TOMS DICKS AND HARRYS
 THERE WAS A SORT OFPOETIC JUSTICE ABOUT IT AFTER ALL FOR THE OLD LADY HAD BEEN THE TERROROF THE BOYS FOR MILES ROUND AND NOW THE EXILES FEASTED FREELY ONFORBIDDEN PLUMS KICKED UP THE GRAVEL WITH PROFANE BOOTS UNREPROVED ANDPLAYED CRICKET IN THE BIG FIELD WHERE THE IRRITABLE COW WITH A CRUMPLEDHORN USED TO INVITE RASH YOUTHS TO COME AND BE TOSSED
 IT BECAME A SORTOF BOYS PARADISE AND LAURIE SUGGESTED THAT IT SHOULD BE CALLED THEBHAERGARTEN AS A COMPLIMENT TO ITS MASTER AND APPROPRIATE TO ITSINHABITANTS
IT NEVER WAS A FASHIONABLE SCHOOL AND THE PROFESSOR DID NOT LAY UP AFORTUNE BUT IT WAS JUST WHAT JO INTENDED IT TO BEA HAPPYHOMELIKE PLACE FOR BOYS WHO NEEDED TEACHING CARE AND KINDNESS
EVERY ROOM IN THE BIG HOUSE WAS SOON FULL EVERY LITTLE PLOT IN THEGARDEN SOON HAD ITS OWNER A REGULAR MENAGERIE APPEARED IN BARN ANDSHED FOR PET ANIMALS WERE ALLOWED AND THREE TIMES A DAY JO SMILED ATHER FRITZ FROM THE HEAD OF A LONG TABLE LINED ON EITHER SIDE WITH ROWSOF HAPPY YOUNG FACES WHICH ALL TURNED TO HER WITH AFFECTIONATE EYESCONFIDING WORDS AND GRATEFUL HEARTS FULL OF LOVE FOR MOTHER BHAER
SHE HAD BOYS ENOUGH NOW AND DID NOT TIRE OF THEM THOUGH THEY WERE NOTANGELS BY ANY MEANS AND SOME OF THEM CAUSED BOTH PROFESSOR ANDPROFESSORIN MUCH TROUBLE AND ANXIETY
 BUT HER FAITH IN THE GOOD SPOTWHICH EXISTS IN THE HEART OF THE NAUGHTIEST SAUCIEST MOST TANTALIZINGLITTLE RAGAMUFFIN GAVE HER PATIENCE SKILL AND IN TIME SUCCESS FORNO MORTAL BOY COULD HOLD OUT LONG WITH FATHER BHAER SHINING ON HIM ASBENEVOLENTLY AS THE SUN AND MOTHER BHAER FORGIVING HIM SEVENTY TIMESSEVEN
 VERY PRECIOUS TO JO WAS THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE LADS THEIRPENITENT SNIFFS AND WHISPERS AFTER WRONGDOING THEIR DROLL OR TOUCHINGLITTLE CONFIDENCES THEIR PLEASANT ENTHUSIASMS HOPES AND PLANS EVENTHEIR MISFORTUNES FOR THEY ONLY ENDEARED THEM TO HER ALL THE MORE
THERE WERE SLOW BOYS AND BASHFUL BOYS FEEBLE BOYS AND RIOTOUS BOYSBOYS THAT LISPED AND BOYS THAT STUTTERED ONE OR TWO LAME ONES AND AMERRY LITTLE QUADROON WHO COULD NOT BE TAKEN IN ELSEWHERE BUT WHO WASWELCOME TO THE BHAERGARTEN THOUGH SOME PEOPLE PREDICTED THAT HISADMISSION WOULD RUIN THE SCHOOL
YES JO WAS A VERY HAPPY WOMAN THERE IN SPITE OF HARD WORK MUCHANXIETY AND A PERPETUAL RACKET
 SHE ENJOYED IT HEARTILY AND FOUND THEAPPLAUSE OF HER BOYS MORE SATISFYING THAN ANY PRAISE OF THE WORLD FORNOW SHE TOLD NO STORIES EXCEPT TO HER FLOCK OF ENTHUSIASTIC BELIEVERSAND ADMIRERS
 AS THE YEARS WENT ON TWO LITTLE LADS OF HER OWN CAME TOINCREASE HER HAPPINESSROB NAMED FOR GRANDPA AND TEDDY AHAPPYGOLUCKY BABY WHO SEEMED TO HAVE INHERITED HIS PAPAS SUNSHINYTEMPER AS WELL AS HIS MOTHERS LIVELY SPIRIT
 HOW THEY EVER GREW UPALIVE IN THAT WHIRLPOOL OF BOYS WAS A MYSTERY TO THEIR GRANDMA ANDAUNTS BUT THEY FLOURISHED LIKE DANDELIONS IN SPRING AND THEIR ROUGHNURSES LOVED AND SERVED THEM WELL
THERE WERE A GREAT MANY HOLIDAYS AT PLUMFIELD AND ONE OF THE MOSTDELIGHTFUL WAS THE YEARLY APPLEPICKING FOR THEN THE MARCHESLAURENCES BROOKES AND BHAERS TURNED OUT IN FULL FORCE AND MADE A DAYOF IT
 FIVE YEARS AFTER JOS WEDDING ONE OF THESE FRUITFUL FESTIVALSOCCURREDA MELLOW OCTOBER DAY WHEN THE AIR WAS FULL OF ANEXHILARATING FRESHNESS WHICH MADE THE SPIRITS RISE AND THE BLOOD DANCEHEALTHILY IN THE VEINS
 THE OLD ORCHARD WORE ITS HOLIDAY ATTIREGOLDENROD AND ASTERS FRINGED THE MOSSY WALLS GRASSHOPPERS SKIPPEDBRISKLY IN THE SERE GRASS AND CRICKETS CHIRPED LIKE FAIRY PIPERS AT AFEAST SQUIRRELS WERE BUSY WITH THEIR SMALL HARVESTING BIRDS TWITTEREDTHEIR ADIEUX FROM THE ALDERS IN THE LANE AND EVERY TREE STOOD READY TOSEND DOWN ITS SHOWER OF RED OR YELLOW APPLES AT THE FIRST SHAKE
EVERYBODY WAS THERE EVERYBODY LAUGHED AND SANG CLIMBED UP AND TUMBLEDDOWN EVERYBODY DECLARED THAT THERE NEVER HAD BEEN SUCH A PERFECT DAY ORSUCH A JOLLY SET TO ENJOY IT AND EVERY ONE GAVE THEMSELVES UP TO THESIMPLE PLEASURES OF THE HOUR AS FREELY AS IF THERE WERE NO SUCH THINGSAS CARE OR SORROW IN THE WORLD
MR

PRELUDE
WHO THAT CARES MUCH TO KNOW THE HISTORY OF MAN AND HOW THE MYSTERIOUSMIXTURE BEHAVES UNDER THE VARYING EXPERIMENTS OF TIME HAS NOT DWELTAT LEAST BRIEFLY ON THE LIFE OF SAINT THERESA HAS NOT SMILED WITHSOME GENTLENESS AT THE THOUGHT OF THE LITTLE GIRL WALKING FORTH ONEMORNING HANDINHAND WITH HER STILL SMALLER BROTHER TO GO AND SEEKMARTYRDOM IN THE COUNTRY OF THE MOORS
 OUT THEY TODDLED FROM RUGGEDAVILA WIDEEYED AND HELPLESSLOOKING AS TWO FAWNS BUT WITH HUMANHEARTS ALREADY BEATING TO A NATIONAL IDEA UNTIL DOMESTIC REALITY METTHEM IN THE SHAPE OF UNCLES AND TURNED THEM BACK FROM THEIR GREATRESOLVE
 THAT CHILDPILGRIMAGE WAS A FIT BEGINNING
 THERESASPASSIONATE IDEAL NATURE DEMANDED AN EPIC LIFE WHAT WERE MANYVOLUMEDROMANCES OF CHIVALRY AND THE SOCIAL CONQUESTS OF A BRILLIANT GIRL TOHER
 HER FLAME QUICKLY BURNED UP THAT LIGHT FUEL AND FED FROM WITHINSOARED AFTER SOME ILLIMITABLE SATISFACTION SOME OBJECT WHICH WOULDNEVER JUSTIFY WEARINESS WHICH WOULD RECONCILE SELFDESPAIR WITH THERAPTUROUS CONSCIOUSNESS OF LIFE BEYOND SELF
 SHE FOUND HER EPOS IN THEREFORM OF A RELIGIOUS ORDER
THAT SPANISH WOMAN WHO LIVED THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO WAS CERTAINLY NOTTHE LAST OF HER KIND
 MANY THERESAS HAVE BEEN BORN WHO FOUND FORTHEMSELVES NO EPIC LIFE WHEREIN THERE WAS A CONSTANT UNFOLDING OFFARRESONANT ACTION PERHAPS ONLY A LIFE OF MISTAKES THE OFFSPRING OFA CERTAIN SPIRITUAL GRANDEUR ILLMATCHED WITH THE MEANNESS OFOPPORTUNITY PERHAPS A TRAGIC FAILURE WHICH FOUND NO SACRED POET ANDSANK UNWEPT INTO OBLIVION
 WITH DIM LIGHTS AND TANGLED CIRCUMSTANCETHEY TRIED TO SHAPE THEIR THOUGHT AND DEED IN NOBLE AGREEMENT BUTAFTER ALL TO COMMON EYES THEIR STRUGGLES SEEMED MERE INCONSISTENCY ANDFORMLESSNESS FOR THESE LATERBORN THERESAS WERE HELPED BY NO COHERENTSOCIAL FAITH AND ORDER WHICH COULD PERFORM THE FUNCTION OF KNOWLEDGEFOR THE ARDENTLY WILLING SOUL
 THEIR ARDOR ALTERNATED BETWEEN A VAGUEIDEAL AND THE COMMON YEARNING OF WOMANHOOD SO THAT THE ONE WASDISAPPROVED AS EXTRAVAGANCE AND THE OTHER CONDEMNED AS A LAPSE
SOME HAVE FELT THAT THESE BLUNDERING LIVES ARE DUE TO THE INCONVENIENTINDEFINITENESS WITH WHICH THE SUPREME POWER HAS FASHIONED THE NATURESOF WOMEN IF THERE WERE ONE LEVEL OF FEMININE INCOMPETENCE AS STRICT ASTHE ABILITY TO COUNT THREE AND NO MORE THE SOCIAL LOT OF WOMEN MIGHTBE TREATED WITH SCIENTIFIC CERTITUDE
 MEANWHILE THE INDEFINITENESSREMAINS AND THE LIMITS OF VARIATION ARE REALLY MUCH WIDER THAN ANY ONEWOULD IMAGINE FROM THE SAMENESS OF WOMENS COIFFURE AND THE FAVORITELOVESTORIES IN PROSE AND VERSE
 HERE AND THERE A CYGNET IS REAREDUNEASILY AMONG THE DUCKLINGS IN THE BROWN POND AND NEVER FINDS THELIVING STREAM IN FELLOWSHIP WITH ITS OWN OARYFOOTED KIND
 HERE ANDTHERE IS BORN A SAINT THERESA FOUNDRESS OF NOTHING WHOSE LOVINGHEARTBEATS AND SOBS AFTER AN UNATTAINED GOODNESS TREMBLE OFF AND AREDISPERSED AMONG HINDRANCES INSTEAD OF CENTRING IN SOMELONGRECOGNIZABLE DEED
BOOK I
MISS BROOKE
CHAPTER I
SINCE I CAN DO NO GOOD BECAUSE A WOMANREACH CONSTANTLY AT SOMETHING THAT IS NEAR IT
                    THE MAIDS TRAGEDY BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER
MISS BROOKE HAD THAT KIND OF BEAUTY WHICH SEEMS TO BE THROWN INTORELIEF BY POOR DRESS
 HER HAND AND WRIST WERE SO FINELY FORMED THAT SHECOULD WEAR SLEEVES NOT LESS BARE OF STYLE THAN THOSE IN WHICH THEBLESSED VIRGIN APPEARED TO ITALIAN PAINTERS AND HER PROFILE AS WELL ASHER STATURE AND BEARING SEEMED TO GAIN THE MORE DIGNITY FROM HER PLAINGARMENTS WHICH BY THE SIDE OF PROVINCIAL FASHION GAVE HER THEIMPRESSIVENESS OF A FINE QUOTATION FROM THE BIBLEOR FROM ONE OF OURELDER POETSIN A PARAGRAPH OF TODAYS NEWSPAPER
 SHE WAS USUALLYSPOKEN OF AS BEING REMARKABLY CLEVER BUT WITH THE ADDITION THAT HERSISTER CELIA HAD MORE COMMONSENSE
 NEVERTHELESS CELIA WORE SCARCELYMORE TRIMMINGS AND IT WAS ONLY TO CLOSE OBSERVERS THAT HER DRESSDIFFERED FROM HER SISTERS AND HAD A SHADE OF COQUETRY IN ITSARRANGEMENTS FOR MISS BROOKES PLAIN DRESSING WAS DUE TO MIXEDCONDITIONS IN MOST OF WHICH HER SISTER SHARED
 THE PRIDE OF BEINGLADIES HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT THE BROOKE CONNECTIONS THOUGH NOTEXACTLY ARISTOCRATIC WERE UNQUESTIONABLY GOOD IF YOU INQUIREDBACKWARD FOR A GENERATION OR TWO YOU WOULD NOT FIND ANY YARDMEASURINGOR PARCELTYING FOREFATHERSANYTHING LOWER THAN AN ADMIRAL OR ACLERGYMAN AND THERE WAS EVEN AN ANCESTOR DISCERNIBLE AS A PURITANGENTLEMAN WHO SERVED UNDER CROMWELL BUT AFTERWARDS CONFORMED ANDMANAGED TO COME OUT OF ALL POLITICAL TROUBLES AS THE PROPRIETOR OF ARESPECTABLE FAMILY ESTATE
 YOUNG WOMEN OF SUCH BIRTH LIVING IN A QUIETCOUNTRYHOUSE AND ATTENDING A VILLAGE CHURCH HARDLY LARGER THAN APARLOR NATURALLY REGARDED FRIPPERY AS THE AMBITION OF A HUCKSTERSDAUGHTER
 THEN THERE WAS WELLBRED ECONOMY WHICH IN THOSE DAYS MADESHOW IN DRESS THE FIRST ITEM TO BE DEDUCTED FROM WHEN ANY MARGIN WASREQUIRED FOR EXPENSES MORE DISTINCTIVE OF RANK
 SUCH REASONS WOULD HAVEBEEN ENOUGH TO ACCOUNT FOR PLAIN DRESS QUITE APART FROM RELIGIOUSFEELING BUT IN MISS BROOKES CASE RELIGION ALONE WOULD HAVEDETERMINED IT AND CELIA MILDLY ACQUIESCED IN ALL HER SISTERSSENTIMENTS ONLY INFUSING THEM WITH THAT COMMONSENSE WHICH IS ABLE TOACCEPT MOMENTOUS DOCTRINES WITHOUT ANY ECCENTRIC AGITATION
 DOROTHEAKNEW MANY PASSAGES OF PASCALS PENSEES AND OF JEREMY TAYLOR BY HEARTAND TO HER THE DESTINIES OF MANKIND SEEN BY THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIANITYMADE THE SOLICITUDES OF FEMININE FASHION APPEAR AN OCCUPATION FORBEDLAM
 SHE COULD NOT RECONCILE THE ANXIETIES OF A SPIRITUAL LIFEINVOLVING ETERNAL CONSEQUENCES WITH A KEEN INTEREST IN GIMP ANDARTIFICIAL PROTRUSIONS OF DRAPERY
 HER MIND WAS THEORETIC AND YEARNEDBY ITS NATURE AFTER SOME LOFTY CONCEPTION OF THE WORLD WHICH MIGHTFRANKLY INCLUDE THE PARISH OF TIPTON AND HER OWN RULE OF CONDUCT THERESHE WAS ENAMOURED OF INTENSITY AND GREATNESS AND RASH IN EMBRACINGWHATEVER SEEMED TO HER TO HAVE THOSE ASPECTS LIKELY TO SEEK MARTYRDOMTO MAKE RETRACTATIONS AND THEN TO INCUR MARTYRDOM AFTER ALL IN AQUARTER WHERE SHE HAD NOT SOUGHT IT
 CERTAINLY SUCH ELEMENTS IN THECHARACTER OF A MARRIAGEABLE GIRL TENDED TO INTERFERE WITH HER LOT ANDHINDER IT FROM BEING DECIDED ACCORDING TO CUSTOM BY GOOD LOOKSVANITY AND MERELY CANINE AFFECTION
 WITH ALL THIS SHE THE ELDER OFTHE SISTERS WAS NOT YET TWENTY AND THEY HAD BOTH BEEN EDUCATED SINCETHEY WERE ABOUT TWELVE YEARS OLD AND HAD LOST THEIR PARENTS ON PLANSAT ONCE NARROW AND PROMISCUOUS FIRST IN AN ENGLISH FAMILY ANDAFTERWARDS IN A SWISS FAMILY AT LAUSANNE THEIR BACHELOR UNCLE ANDGUARDIAN TRYING IN THIS WAY TO REMEDY THE DISADVANTAGES OF THEIRORPHANED CONDITION
IT WAS HARDLY A YEAR SINCE THEY HAD COME TO LIVE AT TIPTON GRANGE WITHTHEIR UNCLE A MAN NEARLY SIXTY OF ACQUIESCENT TEMPER MISCELLANEOUSOPINIONS AND UNCERTAIN VOTE
 HE HAD TRAVELLED IN HIS YOUNGER YEARSAND WAS HELD IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTY TO HAVE CONTRACTED A TOORAMBLING HABIT OF MIND
 MR
 BROOKES CONCLUSIONS WERE AS DIFFICULT TOPREDICT AS THE WEATHER IT WAS ONLY SAFE TO SAY THAT HE WOULD ACT WITHBENEVOLENT INTENTIONS AND THAT HE WOULD SPEND AS LITTLE MONEY ASPOSSIBLE IN CARRYING THEM OUT
 FOR THE MOST GLUTINOUSLY INDEFINITEMINDS ENCLOSE SOME HARD GRAINS OF HABIT AND A MAN HAS BEEN SEEN LAXABOUT ALL HIS OWN INTERESTS EXCEPT THE RETENTION OF HIS SNUFFBOXCONCERNING WHICH HE WAS WATCHFUL SUSPICIOUS AND GREEDY OF CLUTCH
IN MR
 BROOKE THE HEREDITARY STRAIN OF PURITAN ENERGY WAS CLEARLY INABEYANCE BUT IN HIS NIECE DOROTHEA IT GLOWED ALIKE THROUGH FAULTS ANDVIRTUES TURNING SOMETIMES INTO IMPATIENCE OF HER UNCLES TALK OR HISWAY OF LETTING THINGS BE ON HIS ESTATE AND MAKING HER LONG ALL THEMORE FOR THE TIME WHEN SHE WOULD BE OF AGE AND HAVE SOME COMMAND OFMONEY FOR GENEROUS SCHEMES
 SHE WAS REGARDED AS AN HEIRESS FOR NOTONLY HAD THE SISTERS SEVEN HUNDRED AYEAR EACH FROM THEIR PARENTS BUTIF DOROTHEA MARRIED AND HAD A SON THAT SON WOULD INHERIT MR
 BROOKESESTATE PRESUMABLY WORTH ABOUT THREE THOUSAND AYEARA RENTAL WHICHSEEMED WEALTH TO PROVINCIAL FAMILIES STILL DISCUSSING MR
 PEELS LATECONDUCT ON THE CATHOLIC QUESTION INNOCENT OF FUTURE GOLDFIELDS ANDOF THAT GORGEOUS PLUTOCRACY WHICH HAS SO NOBLY EXALTED THE NECESSITIESOF GENTEEL LIFE
AND HOW SHOULD DOROTHEA NOT MARRY
A GIRL SO HANDSOME AND WITH SUCHPROSPECTS
 NOTHING COULD HINDER IT BUT HER LOVE OF EXTREMES AND HERINSISTENCE ON REGULATING LIFE ACCORDING TO NOTIONS WHICH MIGHT CAUSE AWARY MAN TO HESITATE BEFORE HE MADE HER AN OFFER OR EVEN MIGHT LEADHER AT LAST TO REFUSE ALL OFFERS
 A YOUNG LADY OF SOME BIRTH ANDFORTUNE WHO KNELT SUDDENLY DOWN ON A BRICK FLOOR BY THE SIDE OF A SICKLABORER AND PRAYED FERVIDLY AS IF SHE THOUGHT HERSELF LIVING IN THETIME OF THE APOSTLESWHO HAD STRANGE WHIMS OF FASTING LIKE A PAPISTAND OF SITTING UP AT NIGHT TO READ OLD THEOLOGICAL BOOKS
 SUCH A WIFEMIGHT AWAKEN YOU SOME FINE MORNING WITH A NEW SCHEME FOR THEAPPLICATION OF HER INCOME WHICH WOULD INTERFERE WITH POLITICAL ECONOMYAND THE KEEPING OF SADDLEHORSES A MAN WOULD NATURALLY THINK TWICEBEFORE HE RISKED HIMSELF IN SUCH FELLOWSHIP
 WOMEN WERE EXPECTED TOHAVE WEAK OPINIONS BUT THE GREAT SAFEGUARD OF SOCIETY AND OF DOMESTICLIFE WAS THAT OPINIONS WERE NOT ACTED ON
 SANE PEOPLE DID WHAT THEIRNEIGHBORS DID SO THAT IF ANY LUNATICS WERE AT LARGE ONE MIGHT KNOWAND AVOID THEM
THE RURAL OPINION ABOUT THE NEW YOUNG LADIES EVEN AMONG THE COTTAGERSWAS GENERALLY IN FAVOR OF CELIA AS BEING SO AMIABLE ANDINNOCENTLOOKING WHILE MISS BROOKES LARGE EYES SEEMED LIKE HERRELIGION TOO UNUSUAL AND STRIKING
 POOR DOROTHEA
 COMPARED WITH HERTHE INNOCENTLOOKING CELIA WAS KNOWING AND WORLDLYWISE SO MUCHSUBTLER IS A HUMAN MIND THAN THE OUTSIDE TISSUES WHICH MAKE A SORT OFBLAZONRY OR CLOCKFACE FOR IT
YET THOSE WHO APPROACHED DOROTHEA THOUGH PREJUDICED AGAINST HER BYTHIS ALARMING HEARSAY FOUND THAT SHE HAD A CHARM UNACCOUNTABLYRECONCILABLE WITH IT
 MOST MEN THOUGHT HER BEWITCHING WHEN SHE WAS ONHORSEBACK
 SHE LOVED THE FRESH AIR AND THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THECOUNTRY AND WHEN HER EYES AND CHEEKS GLOWED WITH MINGLED PLEASURE SHELOOKED VERY LITTLE LIKE A DEVOTEE
 RIDING WAS AN INDULGENCE WHICH SHEALLOWED HERSELF IN SPITE OF CONSCIENTIOUS QUALMS SHE FELT THAT SHEENJOYED IT IN A PAGAN SENSUOUS WAY AND ALWAYS LOOKED FORWARD TORENOUNCING IT
SHE WAS OPEN ARDENT AND NOT IN THE LEAST SELFADMIRING INDEED ITWAS PRETTY TO SEE HOW HER IMAGINATION ADORNED HER SISTER CELIA WITHATTRACTIONS ALTOGETHER SUPERIOR TO HER OWN AND IF ANY GENTLEMANAPPEARED TO COME TO THE GRANGE FROM SOME OTHER MOTIVE THAN THAT OFSEEING MR
 BROOKE SHE CONCLUDED THAT HE MUST BE IN LOVE WITH CELIASIR JAMES CHETTAM FOR EXAMPLE WHOM SHE CONSTANTLY CONSIDERED FROMCELIAS POINT OF VIEW INWARDLY DEBATING WHETHER IT WOULD BE GOOD FORCELIA TO ACCEPT HIM
 THAT HE SHOULD BE REGARDED AS A SUITOR TO HERSELFWOULD HAVE SEEMED TO HER A RIDICULOUS IRRELEVANCE
 DOROTHEA WITH ALLHER EAGERNESS TO KNOW THE TRUTHS OF LIFE RETAINED VERY CHILDLIKE IDEASABOUT MARRIAGE
 SHE FELT SURE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED THEJUDICIOUS HOOKER IF SHE HAD BEEN BORN IN TIME TO SAVE HIM FROM THATWRETCHED MISTAKE HE MADE IN MATRIMONY OR JOHN MILTON WHEN HISBLINDNESS HAD COME ON OR ANY OF THE OTHER GREAT MEN WHOSE ODD HABITSIT WOULD HAVE BEEN GLORIOUS PIETY TO ENDURE BUT AN AMIABLE HANDSOMEBARONET WHO SAID EXACTLY TO HER REMARKS EVEN WHEN SHE EXPRESSEDUNCERTAINTYHOW COULD HE AFFECT HER AS A LOVER
 THE REALLY DELIGHTFULMARRIAGE MUST BE THAT WHERE YOUR HUSBAND WAS A SORT OF FATHER ANDCOULD TEACH YOU EVEN HEBREW IF YOU WISHED IT
THESE PECULIARITIES OF DOROTHEAS CHARACTER CAUSED MR
 BROOKE TO BE ALLTHE MORE BLAMED IN NEIGHBORING FAMILIES FOR NOT SECURING SOMEMIDDLEAGED LADY AS GUIDE AND COMPANION TO HIS NIECES
 BUT HE HIMSELFDREADED SO MUCH THE SORT OF SUPERIOR WOMAN LIKELY TO BE AVAILABLE FORSUCH A POSITION THAT HE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE DISSUADED BY DOROTHEASOBJECTIONS AND WAS IN THIS CASE BRAVE ENOUGH TO DEFY THE WORLDTHAT ISTO SAY MRS
 CADWALLADER THE RECTORS WIFE AND THE SMALL GROUP OFGENTRY WITH WHOM HE VISITED IN THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF LOAMSHIRE
 SOMISS BROOKE PRESIDED IN HER UNCLES HOUSEHOLD AND DID NOT AT ALLDISLIKE HER NEW AUTHORITY WITH THE HOMAGE THAT BELONGED TO IT
SIR JAMES CHETTAM WAS GOING TO DINE AT THE GRANGE TODAY WITH ANOTHERGENTLEMAN WHOM THE GIRLS HAD NEVER SEEN AND ABOUT WHOM DOROTHEA FELTSOME VENERATING EXPECTATION
 THIS WAS THE REVEREND EDWARD CASAUBONNOTED IN THE COUNTY AS A MAN OF PROFOUND LEARNING UNDERSTOOD FOR MANYYEARS TO BE ENGAGED ON A GREAT WORK CONCERNING RELIGIOUS HISTORY ALSOAS A MAN OF WEALTH ENOUGH TO GIVE LUSTRE TO HIS PIETY AND HAVING VIEWSOF HIS OWN WHICH WERE TO BE MORE CLEARLY ASCERTAINED ON THE PUBLICATIONOF HIS BOOK
 HIS VERY NAME CARRIED AN IMPRESSIVENESS HARDLY TO BEMEASURED WITHOUT A PRECISE CHRONOLOGY OF SCHOLARSHIP
EARLY IN THE DAY DOROTHEA HAD RETURNED FROM THE INFANT SCHOOL WHICH SHEHAD SET GOING IN THE VILLAGE AND WAS TAKING HER USUAL PLACE IN THEPRETTY SITTINGROOM WHICH DIVIDED THE BEDROOMS OF THE SISTERS BENT ONFINISHING A PLAN FOR SOME BUILDINGS A KIND OF WORK WHICH SHE DELIGHTEDIN WHEN CELIA WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING HER WITH A HESITATING DESIRE TOPROPOSE SOMETHING SAIDDOROTHEA DEAR IF YOU DONT MINDIF YOU ARE NOT VERY BUSYSUPPOSE WELOOKED AT MAMMAS JEWELS TODAY AND DIVIDED THEM
 IT IS EXACTLY SIXMONTHS TODAY SINCE UNCLE GAVE THEM TO YOU AND YOU HAVE NOT LOOKED ATTHEM YET
CELIAS FACE HAD THE SHADOW OF A POUTING EXPRESSION IN IT THE FULLPRESENCE OF THE POUT BEING KEPT BACK BY AN HABITUAL AWE OF DOROTHEA ANDPRINCIPLE TWO ASSOCIATED FACTS WHICH MIGHT SHOW A MYSTERIOUSELECTRICITY IF YOU TOUCHED THEM INCAUTIOUSLY
 TO HER RELIEF DOROTHEASEYES WERE FULL OF LAUGHTER AS SHE LOOKED UP
WHAT A WONDERFUL LITTLE ALMANAC YOU ARE CELIA
 IS IT SIX CALENDAR ORSIX LUNAR MONTHS
IT IS THE LAST DAY OF SEPTEMBER NOW AND IT WAS THE FIRST OF APRILWHEN UNCLE GAVE THEM TO YOU
 YOU KNOW HE SAID THAT HE HAD FORGOTTENTHEM TILL THEN
 I BELIEVE YOU HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF THEM SINCE YOULOCKED THEM UP IN THE CABINET HERE
WELL DEAR WE SHOULD NEVER WEAR THEM YOU KNOW
 DOROTHEA SPOKE IN AFULL CORDIAL TONE HALF CARESSING HALF EXPLANATORY
 SHE HAD HER PENCILIN HER HAND AND WAS MAKING TINY SIDEPLANS ON A MARGIN
CELIA COLORED AND LOOKED VERY GRAVE
 I THINK DEAR WE ARE WANTING INRESPECT TO MAMMAS MEMORY TO PUT THEM BY AND TAKE NO NOTICE OF THEM
AND SHE ADDED AFTER HESITATING A LITTLE WITH A RISING SOB OFMORTIFICATION NECKLACES ARE QUITE USUAL NOW AND MADAME POINCON WHOWAS STRICTER IN SOME THINGS EVEN THAN YOU ARE USED TO WEAR ORNAMENTS
AND CHRISTIANS GENERALLYSURELY THERE ARE WOMEN IN HEAVEN NOW WHO WOREJEWELS
 CELIA WAS CONSCIOUS OF SOME MENTAL STRENGTH WHEN SHE REALLYAPPLIED HERSELF TO ARGUMENT
YOU WOULD LIKE TO WEAR THEM
 EXCLAIMED DOROTHEA AN AIR OF ASTONISHEDDISCOVERY ANIMATING HER WHOLE PERSON WITH A DRAMATIC ACTION WHICH SHEHAD CAUGHT FROM THAT VERY MADAME POINCON WHO WORE THE ORNAMENTS
 OFCOURSE THEN LET US HAVE THEM OUT
 WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME BEFORE
 BUTTHE KEYS THE KEYS
 SHE PRESSED HER HANDS AGAINST THE SIDES OF HERHEAD AND SEEMED TO DESPAIR OF HER MEMORY
THEY ARE HERE SAID CELIA WITH WHOM THIS EXPLANATION HAD BEEN LONGMEDITATED AND PREARRANGED
PRAY OPEN THE LARGE DRAWER OF THE CABINET AND GET OUT THE JEWELBOX
THE CASKET WAS SOON OPEN BEFORE THEM AND THE VARIOUS JEWELS SPREADOUT MAKING A BRIGHT PARTERRE ON THE TABLE
 IT WAS NO GREAT COLLECTIONBUT A FEW OF THE ORNAMENTS WERE REALLY OF REMARKABLE BEAUTY THE FINESTTHAT WAS OBVIOUS AT FIRST BEING A NECKLACE OF PURPLE AMETHYSTS SET INEXQUISITE GOLD WORK AND A PEARL CROSS WITH FIVE BRILLIANTS IN IT
DOROTHEA IMMEDIATELY TOOK UP THE NECKLACE AND FASTENED IT ROUND HERSISTERS NECK WHERE IT FITTED ALMOST AS CLOSELY AS A BRACELET BUT THECIRCLE SUITED THE HENRIETTAMARIA STYLE OF CELIAS HEAD AND NECK ANDSHE COULD SEE THAT IT DID IN THE PIERGLASS OPPOSITE
THERE CELIA
 YOU CAN WEAR THAT WITH YOUR INDIAN MUSLIN
 BUT THISCROSS YOU MUST WEAR WITH YOUR DARK DRESSES
CELIA WAS TRYING NOT TO SMILE WITH PLEASURE
 O DODO YOU MUST KEEP THECROSS YOURSELF
NO NO DEAR NO SAID DOROTHEA PUTTING UP HER HAND WITH CARELESSDEPRECATION
YES INDEED YOU MUST IT WOULD SUIT YOUIN YOUR BLACK DRESS NOWSAID CELIA INSISTINGLY
 YOU MIGHT WEAR THAT
NOT FOR THE WORLD NOT FOR THE WORLD
 A CROSS IS THE LAST THING IWOULD WEAR AS A TRINKET
 DOROTHEA SHUDDERED SLIGHTLY
THEN YOU WILL THINK IT WICKED IN ME TO WEAR IT SAID CELIA UNEASILY
NO DEAR NO SAID DOROTHEA STROKING HER SISTERS CHEEK
 SOULS HAVECOMPLEXIONS TOO WHAT WILL SUIT ONE WILL NOT SUIT ANOTHER
BUT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO KEEP IT FOR MAMMAS SAKE
NO I HAVE OTHER THINGS OF MAMMASHER SANDALWOOD BOX WHICH I AM SOFOND OFPLENTY OF THINGS
 IN FACT THEY ARE ALL YOURS DEAR
 WE NEEDDISCUSS THEM NO LONGER
 THERETAKE AWAY YOUR PROPERTY
CELIA FELT A LITTLE HURT
 THERE WAS A STRONG ASSUMPTION OF SUPERIORITYIN THIS PURITANIC TOLERATION HARDLY LESS TRYING TO THE BLOND FLESH OFAN UNENTHUSIASTIC SISTER THAN A PURITANIC PERSECUTION
BUT HOW CAN I WEAR ORNAMENTS IF YOU WHO ARE THE ELDER SISTER WILLNEVER WEAR THEM
NAY CELIA THAT IS TOO MUCH TO ASK THAT I SHOULD WEAR TRINKETS TOKEEP YOU IN COUNTENANCE
 IF I WERE TO PUT ON SUCH A NECKLACE AS THAT ISHOULD FEEL AS IF I HAD BEEN PIROUETTING
 THE WORLD WOULD GO ROUND WITHME AND I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO WALK
CELIA HAD UNCLASPED THE NECKLACE AND DRAWN IT OFF
 IT WOULD BE ALITTLE TIGHT FOR YOUR NECK SOMETHING TO LIE DOWN AND HANG WOULD SUITYOU BETTER SHE SAID WITH SOME SATISFACTION
 THE COMPLETE UNFITNESSOF THE NECKLACE FROM ALL POINTS OF VIEW FOR DOROTHEA MADE CELIAHAPPIER IN TAKING IT
 SHE WAS OPENING SOME RINGBOXES WHICH DISCLOSEDA FINE EMERALD WITH DIAMONDS AND JUST THEN THE SUN PASSING BEYOND ACLOUD SENT A BRIGHT GLEAM OVER THE TABLE
HOW VERY BEAUTIFUL THESE GEMS ARE
 SAID DOROTHEA UNDER A NEW CURRENTOF FEELING AS SUDDEN AS THE GLEAM
 IT IS STRANGE HOW DEEPLY COLORSSEEM TO PENETRATE ONE LIKE SCENT
 I SUPPOSE THAT IS THE REASON WHYGEMS ARE USED AS SPIRITUAL EMBLEMS IN THE REVELATION OF ST
 JOHN
 THEYLOOK LIKE FRAGMENTS OF HEAVEN
 I THINK THAT EMERALD IS MORE BEAUTIFULTHAN ANY OF THEM
AND THERE IS A BRACELET TO MATCH IT SAID CELIA
 WE DID NOT NOTICETHIS AT FIRST
THEY ARE LOVELY SAID DOROTHEA SLIPPING THE RING AND BRACELET ON HERFINELY TURNED FINGER AND WRIST AND HOLDING THEM TOWARDS THE WINDOW ONA LEVEL WITH HER EYES
 ALL THE WHILE HER THOUGHT WAS TRYING TO JUSTIFYHER DELIGHT IN THE COLORS BY MERGING THEM IN HER MYSTIC RELIGIOUS JOY
YOU WOULD LIKE THOSE DOROTHEA SAID CELIA RATHER FALTERINGLYBEGINNING TO THINK WITH WONDER THAT HER SISTER SHOWED SOME WEAKNESSAND ALSO THAT EMERALDS WOULD SUIT HER OWN COMPLEXION EVEN BETTER THANPURPLE AMETHYSTS
 YOU MUST KEEP THAT RING AND BRACELETIF NOTHINGELSE
 BUT SEE THESE AGATES ARE VERY PRETTY AND QUIET
YES
 I WILL KEEP THESETHIS RING AND BRACELET SAID DOROTHEA
 THENLETTING HER HAND FALL ON THE TABLE SHE SAID IN ANOTHER TONEYET WHATMISERABLE MEN FIND SUCH THINGS AND WORK AT THEM AND SELL THEM
 SHEPAUSED AGAIN AND CELIA THOUGHT THAT HER SISTER WAS GOING TO RENOUNCETHE ORNAMENTS AS IN CONSISTENCY SHE OUGHT TO DO
YES DEAR I WILL KEEP THESE SAID DOROTHEA DECIDEDLY
 BUT TAKE ALLTHE REST AWAY AND THE CASKET
SHE TOOK UP HER PENCIL WITHOUT REMOVING THE JEWELS AND STILL LOOKINGAT THEM
 SHE THOUGHT OF OFTEN HAVING THEM BY HER TO FEED HER EYE ATTHESE LITTLE FOUNTAINS OF PURE COLOR
SHALL YOU WEAR THEM IN COMPANY
 SAID CELIA WHO WAS WATCHING HER WITHREAL CURIOSITY AS TO WHAT SHE WOULD DO
DOROTHEA GLANCED QUICKLY AT HER SISTER
 ACROSS ALL HER IMAGINATIVEADORNMENT OF THOSE WHOM SHE LOVED THERE DARTED NOW AND THEN A KEENDISCERNMENT WHICH WAS NOT WITHOUT A SCORCHING QUALITY
 IF MISS BROOKEEVER ATTAINED PERFECT MEEKNESS IT WOULD NOT BE FOR LACK OF INWARDFIRE
PERHAPS SHE SAID RATHER HAUGHTILY
 I CANNOT TELL TO WHAT LEVEL IMAY SINK
CELIA BLUSHED AND WAS UNHAPPY SHE SAW THAT SHE HAD OFFENDED HERSISTER AND DARED NOT SAY EVEN ANYTHING PRETTY ABOUT THE GIFT OF THEORNAMENTS WHICH SHE PUT BACK INTO THE BOX AND CARRIED AWAY
 DOROTHEATOO WAS UNHAPPY AS SHE WENT ON WITH HER PLANDRAWING QUESTIONING THEPURITY OF HER OWN FEELING AND SPEECH IN THE SCENE WHICH HAD ENDED WITHTHAT LITTLE EXPLOSION
CELIAS CONSCIOUSNESS TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN AT ALL IN THEWRONG IT WAS QUITE NATURAL AND JUSTIFIABLE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE ASKEDTHAT QUESTION AND SHE REPEATED TO HERSELF THAT DOROTHEA WASINCONSISTENT EITHER SHE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HER FULL SHARE OF THEJEWELS OR AFTER WHAT SHE HAD SAID SHE SHOULD HAVE RENOUNCED THEMALTOGETHER
I AM SUREAT LEAST I TRUST THOUGHT CELIA THAT THE WEARING OF ANECKLACE WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH MY PRAYERS
 AND I DO NOT SEE THAT ISHOULD BE BOUND BY DOROTHEAS OPINIONS NOW WE ARE GOING INTO SOCIETYTHOUGH OF COURSE SHE HERSELF OUGHT TO BE BOUND BY THEM
 BUT DOROTHEA ISNOT ALWAYS CONSISTENT
THUS CELIA MUTELY BENDING OVER HER TAPESTRY UNTIL SHE HEARD HERSISTER CALLING HER
HERE KITTY COME AND LOOK AT MY PLAN I SHALL THINK I AM A GREATARCHITECT IF I HAVE NOT GOT INCOMPATIBLE STAIRS AND FIREPLACES
AS CELIA BENT OVER THE PAPER DOROTHEA PUT HER CHEEK AGAINST HERSISTERS ARM CARESSINGLY
 CELIA UNDERSTOOD THE ACTION
 DOROTHEA SAWTHAT SHE HAD BEEN IN THE WRONG AND CELIA PARDONED HER
 SINCE THEYCOULD REMEMBER THERE HAD BEEN A MIXTURE OF CRITICISM AND AWE IN THEATTITUDE OF CELIAS MIND TOWARDS HER ELDER SISTER
 THE YOUNGER HADALWAYS WORN A YOKE BUT IS THERE ANY YOKED CREATURE WITHOUT ITS PRIVATEOPINIONS
CHAPTER II
DIME NO VES AQUEL CABALLERO QUE HACIA NOSOTROS VIENE SOBRE UNCABALLO RUCIO RODADO QUE TRAE PUESTO EN LA CABEZA UN YELMO DE ORO
 LOQUE VEO Y COLUMBRO RESPONDIO SANCHO NO ES SINO UN HOMBRE SOBRE UNAS NO PARDO COMO EL MIO QUE TRAE SOBRE LA CABEZA UNA COSA QUERELUMBRA

SEEST THOU NOT YON CAVALIER WHO COMETH TOWARD US ON A DAPPLEGRAYSTEED AND WEARETH A GOLDEN HELMET
 WHAT I SEE ANSWERED SANCHO ISNOTHING BUT A MAN ON A GRAY ASS LIKE MY OWN WHO CARRIES SOMETHINGSHINY ON HIS HEAD
 JUST SO ANSWERED DON QUIXOTE AND THATRESPLENDENT OBJECT IS THE HELMET OF MAMBRINO
SIR HUMPHRY DAVY
 SAID MR
 BROOKE OVER THE SOUP IN HIS EASY SMILINGWAY TAKING UP SIR JAMES CHETTAMS REMARK THAT HE WAS STUDYING DAVYSAGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY
 WELL NOW SIR HUMPHRY DAVY I DINED WITH HIMYEARS AGO AT CARTWRIGHTS AND WORDSWORTH WAS THERE TOOTHE POETWORDSWORTH YOU KNOW
 NOW THERE WAS SOMETHING SINGULAR
 I WAS ATCAMBRIDGE WHEN WORDSWORTH WAS THERE AND I NEVER MET HIMAND I DINEDWITH HIM TWENTY YEARS AFTERWARDS AT CARTWRIGHTS
 THERES AN ODDITY INTHINGS NOW
 BUT DAVY WAS THERE HE WAS A POET TOO
 OR AS I MAY SAYWORDSWORTH WAS POET ONE AND DAVY WAS POET TWO
 THAT WAS TRUE IN EVERYSENSE YOU KNOW
DOROTHEA FELT A LITTLE MORE UNEASY THAN USUAL
 IN THE BEGINNING OFDINNER THE PARTY BEING SMALL AND THE ROOM STILL THESE MOTES FROM THEMASS OF A MAGISTRATES MIND FELL TOO NOTICEABLY
 SHE WONDERED HOW A MANLIKE MR
 CASAUBON WOULD SUPPORT SUCH TRIVIALITY
 HIS MANNERS SHETHOUGHT WERE VERY DIGNIFIED THE SET OF HIS IRONGRAY HAIR AND HISDEEP EYESOCKETS MADE HIM RESEMBLE THE PORTRAIT OF LOCKE
 HE HAD THESPARE FORM AND THE PALE COMPLEXION WHICH BECAME A STUDENT AS DIFFERENTAS POSSIBLE FROM THE BLOOMING ENGLISHMAN OF THE REDWHISKERED TYPEREPRESENTED BY SIR JAMES CHETTAM
I AM READING THE AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY SAID THIS EXCELLENT BARONETBECAUSE I AM GOING TO TAKE ONE OF THE FARMS INTO MY OWN HANDS AND SEEIF SOMETHING CANNOT BE DONE IN SETTING A GOOD PATTERN OF FARMING AMONGMY TENANTS
 DO YOU APPROVE OF THAT MISS BROOKE
A GREAT MISTAKE CHETTAM INTERPOSED MR
 BROOKE GOING INTOELECTRIFYING YOUR LAND AND THAT KIND OF THING AND MAKING A PARLOR OFYOUR COWHOUSE
 IT WONT DO
 I WENT INTO SCIENCE A GREAT DEAL MYSELF ATONE TIME BUT I SAW IT WOULD NOT DO
 IT LEADS TO EVERYTHING YOU CANLET NOTHING ALONE
 NO NOSEE THAT YOUR TENANTS DONT SELL THEIR STRAWAND THAT KIND OF THING AND GIVE THEM DRAININGTILES YOU KNOW
 BUTYOUR FANCY FARMING WILL NOT DOTHE MOST EXPENSIVE SORT OF WHISTLE YOUCAN BUY YOU MAY AS WELL KEEP A PACK OF HOUNDS
SURELY SAID DOROTHEA IT IS BETTER TO SPEND MONEY IN FINDING OUTHOW MEN CAN MAKE THE MOST OF THE LAND WHICH SUPPORTS THEM ALL THAN INKEEPING DOGS AND HORSES ONLY TO GALLOP OVER IT
 IT IS NOT A SIN TO MAKEYOURSELF POOR IN PERFORMING EXPERIMENTS FOR THE GOOD OF ALL
SHE SPOKE WITH MORE ENERGY THAN IS EXPECTED OF SO YOUNG A LADY BUT SIRJAMES HAD APPEALED TO HER
 HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO SO AND SHE HADOFTEN THOUGHT THAT SHE COULD URGE HIM TO MANY GOOD ACTIONS WHEN HE WASHER BROTHERINLAW
MR
 CASAUBON TURNED HIS EYES VERY MARKEDLY ON DOROTHEA WHILE SHE WASSPEAKING AND SEEMED TO OBSERVE HER NEWLY
YOUNG LADIES DONT UNDERSTAND POLITICAL ECONOMY YOU KNOW SAID MR
BROOKE SMILING TOWARDS MR
 CASAUBON
 I REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE ALLREADING ADAM SMITH
 THERE IS A BOOK NOW
 I TOOK IN ALL THE NEW IDEASAT ONE TIMEHUMAN PERFECTIBILITY NOW
 BUT SOME SAY HISTORY MOVES INCIRCLES AND THAT MAY BE VERY WELL ARGUED I HAVE ARGUED IT MYSELF
 THEFACT IS HUMAN REASON MAY CARRY YOU A LITTLE TOO FAROVER THE HEDGE INFACT
 IT CARRIED ME A GOOD WAY AT ONE TIME BUT I SAW IT WOULD NOT DO
I PULLED UP I PULLED UP IN TIME
 BUT NOT TOO HARD
 I HAVE ALWAYS BEENIN FAVOR OF A LITTLE THEORY WE MUST HAVE THOUGHT ELSE WE SHALL BELANDED BACK IN THE DARK AGES
 BUT TALKING OF BOOKS THERE IS SOUTHEYSPENINSULAR WAR
 I AM READING THAT OF A MORNING
 YOU KNOW SOUTHEY
NO SAID MR
 CASAUBON NOT KEEPING PACE WITH MR
 BROOKES IMPETUOUSREASON AND THINKING OF THE BOOK ONLY
 I HAVE LITTLE LEISURE FOR SUCHLITERATURE JUST NOW
 I HAVE BEEN USING UP MY EYESIGHT ON OLD CHARACTERSLATELY THE FACT IS I WANT A READER FOR MY EVENINGS BUT I AMFASTIDIOUS IN VOICES AND I CANNOT ENDURE LISTENING TO AN IMPERFECTREADER
 IT IS A MISFORTUNE IN SOME SENSES I FEED TOO MUCH ON THEINWARD SOURCES I LIVE TOO MUCH WITH THE DEAD
 MY MIND IS SOMETHINGLIKE THE GHOST OF AN ANCIENT WANDERING ABOUT THE WORLD AND TRYINGMENTALLY TO CONSTRUCT IT AS IT USED TO BE IN SPITE OF RUIN ANDCONFUSING CHANGES
 BUT I FIND IT NECESSARY TO USE THE UTMOST CAUTIONABOUT MY EYESIGHT
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT MR
 CASAUBON HAD SPOKEN AT ANY LENGTH
 HEDELIVERED HIMSELF WITH PRECISION AS IF HE HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO MAKEA PUBLIC STATEMENT AND THE BALANCED SINGSONG NEATNESS OF HIS SPEECHOCCASIONALLY CORRESPONDED TO BY A MOVEMENT OF HIS HEAD WAS THE MORECONSPICUOUS FROM ITS CONTRAST WITH GOOD MR
 BROOKES SCRAPPYSLOVENLINESS
 DOROTHEA SAID TO HERSELF THAT MR
 CASAUBON WAS THE MOSTINTERESTING MAN SHE HAD EVER SEEN NOT EXCEPTING EVEN MONSIEUR LIRETTHE VAUDOIS CLERGYMAN WHO HAD GIVEN CONFERENCES ON THE HISTORY OF THEWALDENSES
 TO RECONSTRUCT A PAST WORLD DOUBTLESS WITH A VIEW TO THEHIGHEST PURPOSES OF TRUTHWHAT A WORK TO BE IN ANY WAY PRESENT AT TOASSIST IN THOUGH ONLY AS A LAMPHOLDER
 THIS ELEVATING THOUGHT LIFTEDHER ABOVE HER ANNOYANCE AT BEING TWITTED WITH HER IGNORANCE OFPOLITICAL ECONOMY THAT NEVEREXPLAINED SCIENCE WHICH WAS THRUST AS ANEXTINGUISHER OVER ALL HER LIGHTS
BUT YOU ARE FOND OF RIDING MISS BROOKE SIR JAMES PRESENTLY TOOK ANOPPORTUNITY OF SAYING
 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU WOULD ENTER A LITTLEINTO THE PLEASURES OF HUNTING
 I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME SEND OVER ACHESTNUT HORSE FOR YOU TO TRY
 IT HAS BEEN TRAINED FOR A LADY
 I SAWYOU ON SATURDAY CANTERING OVER THE HILL ON A NAG NOT WORTHY OF YOU
 MYGROOM SHALL BRING CORYDON FOR YOU EVERY DAY IF YOU WILL ONLY MENTIONTHE TIME
THANK YOU YOU ARE VERY GOOD
 I MEAN TO GIVE UP RIDING
 I SHALL NOTRIDE ANY MORE SAID DOROTHEA URGED TO THIS BRUSQUE RESOLUTION BY ALITTLE ANNOYANCE THAT SIR JAMES WOULD BE SOLICITING HER ATTENTION WHENSHE WANTED TO GIVE IT ALL TO MR
 CASAUBON
NO THAT IS TOO HARD SAID SIR JAMES IN A TONE OF REPROACH THATSHOWED STRONG INTEREST
 YOUR SISTER IS GIVEN TO SELFMORTIFICATION ISSHE NOT
 HE CONTINUED TURNING TO CELIA WHO SAT AT HIS RIGHT HAND
I THINK SHE IS SAID CELIA FEELING AFRAID LEST SHE SHOULD SAYSOMETHING THAT WOULD NOT PLEASE HER SISTER AND BLUSHING AS PRETTILY ASPOSSIBLE ABOVE HER NECKLACE
 SHE LIKES GIVING UP
IF THAT WERE TRUE CELIA MY GIVINGUP WOULD BE SELFINDULGENCE NOTSELFMORTIFICATION
 BUT THERE MAY BE GOOD REASONS FOR CHOOSING NOT TODO WHAT IS VERY AGREEABLE SAID DOROTHEA
MR
 BROOKE WAS SPEAKING AT THE SAME TIME BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MR
CASAUBON WAS OBSERVING DOROTHEA AND SHE WAS AWARE OF IT
EXACTLY SAID SIR JAMES
 YOU GIVE UP FROM SOME HIGH GENEROUSMOTIVE
NO INDEED NOT EXACTLY
 I DID NOT SAY THAT OF MYSELF ANSWEREDDOROTHEA REDDENING
 UNLIKE CELIA SHE RARELY BLUSHED AND ONLY FROMHIGH DELIGHT OR ANGER
 AT THIS MOMENT SHE FELT ANGRY WITH THE PERVERSESIR JAMES
 WHY DID HE NOT PAY ATTENTION TO CELIA AND LEAVE HER TOLISTEN TO MR
 CASAUBON
IF THAT LEARNED MAN WOULD ONLY TALK INSTEAD OFALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE TALKED TO BY MR
 BROOKE WHO WAS JUST THENINFORMING HIM THAT THE REFORMATION EITHER MEANT SOMETHING OR IT DIDNOT THAT HE HIMSELF WAS A PROTESTANT TO THE CORE BUT THAT CATHOLICISMWAS A FACT AND AS TO REFUSING AN ACRE OF YOUR GROUND FOR A ROMANISTCHAPEL ALL MEN NEEDED THE BRIDLE OF RELIGION WHICH PROPERLYSPEAKING WAS THE DREAD OF A HEREAFTER
I MADE A GREAT STUDY OF THEOLOGY AT ONE TIME SAID MR
 BROOKE AS IFTO EXPLAIN THE INSIGHT JUST MANIFESTED
 I KNOW SOMETHING OF ALLSCHOOLS
 I KNEW WILBERFORCE IN HIS BEST DAYS
 DO YOU KNOW WILBERFORCE
MR
 CASAUBON SAID NO
WELL WILBERFORCE WAS PERHAPS NOT ENOUGH OF A THINKER BUT IF I WENTINTO PARLIAMENT AS I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO DO I SHOULD SIT ON THEINDEPENDENT BENCH AS WILBERFORCE DID AND WORK AT PHILANTHROPY
MR
 CASAUBON BOWED AND OBSERVED THAT IT WAS A WIDE FIELD
YES SAID MR
 BROOKE WITH AN EASY SMILE BUT I HAVE DOCUMENTS
 IBEGAN A LONG WHILE AGO TO COLLECT DOCUMENTS
 THEY WANT ARRANGING BUTWHEN A QUESTION HAS STRUCK ME I HAVE WRITTEN TO SOMEBODY AND GOT ANANSWER
 I HAVE DOCUMENTS AT MY BACK
 BUT NOW HOW DO YOU ARRANGE YOURDOCUMENTS
IN PIGEONHOLES PARTLY SAID MR
 CASAUBON WITH RATHER A STARTLED AIROF EFFORT
AH PIGEONHOLES WILL NOT DO
 I HAVE TRIED PIGEONHOLES BUTEVERYTHING GETS MIXED IN PIGEONHOLES I NEVER KNOW WHETHER A PAPER ISIN A OR Z
I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME SORT YOUR PAPERS FOR YOU UNCLE SAIDDOROTHEA
 I WOULD LETTER THEM ALL AND THEN MAKE A LIST OF SUBJECTSUNDER EACH LETTER
MR
 CASAUBON GRAVELY SMILED APPROVAL AND SAID TO MR
 BROOKE YOU HAVEAN EXCELLENT SECRETARY AT HAND YOU PERCEIVE
NO NO SAID MR
 BROOKE SHAKING HIS HEAD I CANNOT LET YOUNG LADIESMEDDLE WITH MY DOCUMENTS
 YOUNG LADIES ARE TOO FLIGHTY
DOROTHEA FELT HURT
 MR
 CASAUBON WOULD THINK THAT HER UNCLE HAD SOMESPECIAL REASON FOR DELIVERING THIS OPINION WHEREAS THE REMARK LAY INHIS MIND AS LIGHTLY AS THE BROKEN WING OF AN INSECT AMONG ALL THE OTHERFRAGMENTS THERE AND A CHANCE CURRENT HAD SENT IT ALIGHTING ON HER
WHEN THE TWO GIRLS WERE IN THE DRAWINGROOM ALONE CELIA SAIDHOW VERY UGLY MR
 CASAUBON IS
CELIA
 HE IS ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHEDLOOKING MEN I EVER SAW
 HEIS REMARKABLY LIKE THE PORTRAIT OF LOCKE
 HE HAS THE SAME DEEPEYESOCKETS
HAD LOCKE THOSE TWO WHITE MOLES WITH HAIRS ON THEM
OH I DARE SAY
 WHEN PEOPLE OF A CERTAIN SORT LOOKED AT HIM SAIDDOROTHEA WALKING AWAY A LITTLE
MR
 CASAUBON IS SO SALLOW
ALL THE BETTER
 I SUPPOSE YOU ADMIRE A MAN WITH THE COMPLEXION OF ACOCHON DE LAIT
DODO
 EXCLAIMED CELIA LOOKING AFTER HER IN SURPRISE
 I NEVER HEARDYOU MAKE SUCH A COMPARISON BEFORE
WHY SHOULD I MAKE IT BEFORE THE OCCASION CAME
 IT IS A GOODCOMPARISON THE MATCH IS PERFECT
MISS BROOKE WAS CLEARLY FORGETTING HERSELF AND CELIA THOUGHT SO
I WONDER YOU SHOW TEMPER DOROTHEA
IT IS SO PAINFUL IN YOU CELIA THAT YOU WILL LOOK AT HUMAN BEINGS ASIF THEY WERE MERELY ANIMALS WITH A TOILET AND NEVER SEE THE GREAT SOULIN A MANS FACE
HAS MR
 CASAUBON A GREAT SOUL
 CELIA WAS NOT WITHOUT A TOUCH OF NAIVEMALICE
YES I BELIEVE HE HAS SAID DOROTHEA WITH THE FULL VOICE OFDECISION
 EVERYTHING I SEE IN HIM CORRESPONDS TO HIS PAMPHLET ONBIBLICAL COSMOLOGY
HE TALKS VERY LITTLE SAID CELIATHERE IS NO ONE FOR HIM TO TALK TO
CELIA THOUGHT PRIVATELY DOROTHEA QUITE DESPISES SIR JAMES CHETTAM IBELIEVE SHE WOULD NOT ACCEPT HIM
 CELIA FELT THAT THIS WAS A PITY
 SHEHAD NEVER BEEN DECEIVED AS TO THE OBJECT OF THE BARONETS INTEREST
SOMETIMES INDEED SHE HAD REFLECTED THAT DODO WOULD PERHAPS NOT MAKE AHUSBAND HAPPY WHO HAD NOT HER WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS AND STIFLED INTHE DEPTHS OF HER HEART WAS THE FEELING THAT HER SISTER WAS TOORELIGIOUS FOR FAMILY COMFORT
 NOTIONS AND SCRUPLES WERE LIKE SPILTNEEDLES MAKING ONE AFRAID OF TREADING OR SITTING DOWN OR EVENEATING
WHEN MISS BROOKE WAS AT THE TEATABLE SIR JAMES CAME TO SIT DOWN BYHER NOT HAVING FELT HER MODE OF ANSWERING HIM AT ALL OFFENSIVE
 WHYSHOULD HE
 HE THOUGHT IT PROBABLE THAT MISS BROOKE LIKED HIM ANDMANNERS MUST BE VERY MARKED INDEED BEFORE THEY CEASE TO BE INTERPRETEDBY PRECONCEPTIONS EITHER CONFIDENT OR DISTRUSTFUL
 SHE WAS THOROUGHLYCHARMING TO HIM BUT OF COURSE HE THEORIZED A LITTLE ABOUT HISATTACHMENT
 HE WAS MADE OF EXCELLENT HUMAN DOUGH AND HAD THE RAREMERIT OF KNOWING THAT HIS TALENTS EVEN IF LET LOOSE WOULD NOT SET THESMALLEST STREAM IN THE COUNTY ON FIRE HENCE HE LIKED THE PROSPECT OF AWIFE TO WHOM HE COULD SAY WHAT SHALL WE DO
 ABOUT THIS OR THAT WHOCOULD HELP HER HUSBAND OUT WITH REASONS AND WOULD ALSO HAVE THEPROPERTY QUALIFICATION FOR DOING SO
 AS TO THE EXCESSIVE RELIGIOUSNESSALLEGED AGAINST MISS BROOKE HE HAD A VERY INDEFINITE NOTION OF WHAT ITCONSISTED IN AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD DIE OUT WITH MARRIAGE
 INSHORT HE FELT HIMSELF TO BE IN LOVE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND WAS READYTO ENDURE A GREAT DEAL OF PREDOMINANCE WHICH AFTER ALL A MAN COULDALWAYS PUT DOWN WHEN HE LIKED
 SIR JAMES HAD NO IDEA THAT HE SHOULDEVER LIKE TO PUT DOWN THE PREDOMINANCE OF THIS HANDSOME GIRL IN WHOSECLEVERNESS HE DELIGHTED
 WHY NOT
 A MANS MINDWHAT THERE IS OF ITHASALWAYS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING MASCULINEAS THE SMALLEST BIRCHTREE ISOF A HIGHER KIND THAN THE MOST SOARING PALMAND EVEN HIS IGNORANCE ISOF A SOUNDER QUALITY
 SIR JAMES MIGHT NOT HAVE ORIGINATED THISESTIMATE BUT A KIND PROVIDENCE FURNISHES THE LIMPEST PERSONALITY WITHA LITTLE GUM OR STARCH IN THE FORM OF TRADITION
LET ME HOPE THAT YOU WILL RESCIND THAT RESOLUTION ABOUT THE HORSEMISS BROOKE SAID THE PERSEVERING ADMIRER
 I ASSURE YOU RIDING ISTHE MOST HEALTHY OF EXERCISES
I AM AWARE OF IT SAID DOROTHEA COLDLY
 I THINK IT WOULD DO CELIAGOODIF SHE WOULD TAKE TO IT
BUT YOU ARE SUCH A PERFECT HORSEWOMAN
EXCUSE ME I HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE PRACTICE AND I SHOULD BE EASILYTHROWN
THEN THAT IS A REASON FOR MORE PRACTICE
 EVERY LADY OUGHT TO BE APERFECT HORSEWOMAN THAT SHE MAY ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND
YOU SEE HOW WIDELY WE DIFFER SIR JAMES
 I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND THAT IOUGHT NOT TO BE A PERFECT HORSEWOMAN AND SO I SHOULD NEVER CORRESPONDTO YOUR PATTERN OF A LADY
 DOROTHEA LOOKED STRAIGHT BEFORE HER ANDSPOKE WITH COLD BRUSQUERIE VERY MUCH WITH THE AIR OF A HANDSOME BOYIN AMUSING CONTRAST WITH THE SOLICITOUS AMIABILITY OF HER ADMIRER
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR REASONS FOR THIS CRUEL RESOLUTION
 IT ISNOT POSSIBLE THAT YOU SHOULD THINK HORSEMANSHIP WRONG
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD THINK IT WRONG FOR ME
OH WHY
 SAID SIR JAMES IN A TENDER TONE OF REMONSTRANCE
MR
 CASAUBON HAD COME UP TO THE TABLE TEACUP IN HAND AND WASLISTENING
WE MUST NOT INQUIRE TOO CURIOUSLY INTO MOTIVES HE INTERPOSED IN HISMEASURED WAY
 MISS BROOKE KNOWS THAT THEY ARE APT TO BECOME FEEBLE INTHE UTTERANCE THE AROMA IS MIXED WITH THE GROSSER AIR
 WE MUST KEEPTHE GERMINATING GRAIN AWAY FROM THE LIGHT
DOROTHEA COLORED WITH PLEASURE AND LOOKED UP GRATEFULLY TO THESPEAKER
 HERE WAS A MAN WHO COULD UNDERSTAND THE HIGHER INWARD LIFEAND WITH WHOM THERE COULD BE SOME SPIRITUAL COMMUNION NAY WHO COULDILLUMINATE PRINCIPLE WITH THE WIDEST KNOWLEDGE A MAN WHOSE LEARNINGALMOST AMOUNTED TO A PROOF OF WHATEVER HE BELIEVED
DOROTHEAS INFERENCES MAY SEEM LARGE BUT REALLY LIFE COULD NEVER HAVEGONE ON AT ANY PERIOD BUT FOR THIS LIBERAL ALLOWANCE OF CONCLUSIONSWHICH HAS FACILITATED MARRIAGE UNDER THE DIFFICULTIES OF CIVILIZATION
HAS ANY ONE EVER PINCHED INTO ITS PILULOUS SMALLNESS THE COBWEB OFPREMATRIMONIAL ACQUAINTANCESHIP
CERTAINLY SAID GOOD SIR JAMES
 MISS BROOKE SHALL NOT BE URGED TOTELL REASONS SHE WOULD RATHER BE SILENT UPON
 I AM SURE HER REASONSWOULD DO HER HONOR
HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST JEALOUS OF THE INTEREST WITH WHICH DOROTHEA HADLOOKED UP AT MR
 CASAUBON IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT A GIRL TO WHOMHE WAS MEDITATING AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE COULD CARE FOR A DRIED BOOKWORMTOWARDS FIFTY EXCEPT INDEED IN A RELIGIOUS SORT OF WAY AS FOR ACLERGYMAN OF SOME DISTINCTION
HOWEVER SINCE MISS BROOKE HAD BECOME ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION WITHMR
 CASAUBON ABOUT THE VAUDOIS CLERGY SIR JAMES BETOOK HIMSELF TOCELIA AND TALKED TO HER ABOUT HER SISTER SPOKE OF A HOUSE IN TOWNAND ASKED WHETHER MISS BROOKE DISLIKED LONDON
 AWAY FROM HER SISTERCELIA TALKED QUITE EASILY AND SIR JAMES SAID TO HIMSELF THAT THESECOND MISS BROOKE WAS CERTAINLY VERY AGREEABLE AS WELL AS PRETTYTHOUGH NOT AS SOME PEOPLE PRETENDED MORE CLEVER AND SENSIBLE THAN THEELDER SISTER
 HE FELT THAT HE HAD CHOSEN THE ONE WHO WAS IN ALLRESPECTS THE SUPERIOR AND A MAN NATURALLY LIKES TO LOOK FORWARD TOHAVING THE BEST
 HE WOULD BE THE VERY MAWWORM OF BACHELORS WHOPRETENDED NOT TO EXPECT IT
CHAPTER III
SAY GODDESS WHAT ENSUED WHEN RAPHAELTHE AFFABLE ARCHANGEL 
 
 
                    EVETHE STORY HEARD ATTENTIVE AND WAS FILLEDWITH ADMIRATION AND DEEP MUSE TO HEAROF THINGS SO HIGH AND STRANGE
PARADISE LOST B
 VII
IF IT HAD REALLY OCCURRED TO MR
 CASAUBON TO THINK OF MISS BROOKE AS ASUITABLE WIFE FOR HIM THE REASONS THAT MIGHT INDUCE HER TO ACCEPT HIMWERE ALREADY PLANTED IN HER MIND AND BY THE EVENING OF THE NEXT DAYTHE REASONS HAD BUDDED AND BLOOMED
 FOR THEY HAD HAD A LONGCONVERSATION IN THE MORNING WHILE CELIA WHO DID NOT LIKE THE COMPANYOF MR
 CASAUBONS MOLES AND SALLOWNESS HAD ESCAPED TO THE VICARAGE TOPLAY WITH THE CURATES ILLSHOD BUT MERRY CHILDREN
DOROTHEA BY THIS TIME HAD LOOKED DEEP INTO THE UNGAUGED RESERVOIR OFMR
 CASAUBONS MIND SEEING REFLECTED THERE IN VAGUE LABYRINTHINEEXTENSION EVERY QUALITY SHE HERSELF BROUGHT HAD OPENED MUCH OF HER OWNEXPERIENCE TO HIM AND HAD UNDERSTOOD FROM HIM THE SCOPE OF HIS GREATWORK ALSO OF ATTRACTIVELY LABYRINTHINE EXTENT
 FOR HE HAD BEEN ASINSTRUCTIVE AS MILTONS AFFABLE ARCHANGEL AND WITH SOMETHING OF THEARCHANGELIC MANNER HE TOLD HER HOW HE HAD UNDERTAKEN TO SHOW WHATINDEED HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED BEFORE BUT NOT WITH THAT THOROUGHNESSJUSTICE OF COMPARISON AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ARRANGEMENT AT WHICH MR
CASAUBON AIMED THAT ALL THE MYTHICAL SYSTEMS OR ERRATIC MYTHICALFRAGMENTS IN THE WORLD WERE CORRUPTIONS OF A TRADITION ORIGINALLYREVEALED
 HAVING ONCE MASTERED THE TRUE POSITION AND TAKEN A FIRMFOOTING THERE THE VAST FIELD OF MYTHICAL CONSTRUCTIONS BECAMEINTELLIGIBLE NAY LUMINOUS WITH THE REFLECTED LIGHT OFCORRESPONDENCES
 BUT TO GATHER IN THIS GREAT HARVEST OF TRUTH WAS NOLIGHT OR SPEEDY WORK
 HIS NOTES ALREADY MADE A FORMIDABLE RANGE OFVOLUMES BUT THE CROWNING TASK WOULD BE TO CONDENSE THESE VOLUMINOUSSTILLACCUMULATING RESULTS AND BRING THEM LIKE THE EARLIER VINTAGE OFHIPPOCRATIC BOOKS TO FIT A LITTLE SHELF
 IN EXPLAINING THIS TODOROTHEA MR
 CASAUBON EXPRESSED HIMSELF NEARLY AS HE WOULD HAVE DONETO A FELLOWSTUDENT FOR HE HAD NOT TWO STYLES OF TALKING AT COMMANDIT IS TRUE THAT WHEN HE USED A GREEK OR LATIN PHRASE HE ALWAYS GAVE THEENGLISH WITH SCRUPULOUS CARE BUT HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE DONE THIS INANY CASE
 A LEARNED PROVINCIAL CLERGYMAN IS ACCUSTOMED TO THINK OF HISACQUAINTANCES AS OF LORDS KNYGHTES AND OTHER NOBLE AND WORTHI MENTHAT CONNE LATYN BUT LYTILLE
DOROTHEA WAS ALTOGETHER CAPTIVATED BY THE WIDE EMBRACE OF THISCONCEPTION
 HERE WAS SOMETHING BEYOND THE SHALLOWS OF LADIES SCHOOLLITERATURE HERE WAS A LIVING BOSSUET WHOSE WORK WOULD RECONCILECOMPLETE KNOWLEDGE WITH DEVOTED PIETY HERE WAS A MODERN AUGUSTINE WHOUNITED THE GLORIES OF DOCTOR AND SAINT
THE SANCTITY SEEMED NO LESS CLEARLY MARKED THAN THE LEARNING FOR WHENDOROTHEA WAS IMPELLED TO OPEN HER MIND ON CERTAIN THEMES WHICH SHECOULD SPEAK OF TO NO ONE WHOM SHE HAD BEFORE SEEN AT TIPTON ESPECIALLYON THE SECONDARY IMPORTANCE OF ECCLESIASTICAL FORMS AND ARTICLES OFBELIEF COMPARED WITH THAT SPIRITUAL RELIGION THAT SUBMERGENCE OF SELFIN COMMUNION WITH DIVINE PERFECTION WHICH SEEMED TO HER TO BE EXPRESSEDIN THE BEST CHRISTIAN BOOKS OF WIDELY DISTANT AGES SHE FOUND IN MR
CASAUBON A LISTENER WHO UNDERSTOOD HER AT ONCE WHO COULD ASSURE HER OFHIS OWN AGREEMENT WITH THAT VIEW WHEN DULY TEMPERED WITH WISECONFORMITY AND COULD MENTION HISTORICAL EXAMPLES BEFORE UNKNOWN TOHER
HE THINKS WITH ME SAID DOROTHEA TO HERSELF OR RATHER HE THINKS AWHOLE WORLD OF WHICH MY THOUGHT IS BUT A POOR TWOPENNY MIRROR
 AND HISFEELINGS TOO HIS WHOLE EXPERIENCEWHAT A LAKE COMPARED WITH MY LITTLEPOOL
MISS BROOKE ARGUED FROM WORDS AND DISPOSITIONS NOT LESS UNHESITATINGLYTHAN OTHER YOUNG LADIES OF HER AGE
 SIGNS ARE SMALL MEASURABLE THINGSBUT INTERPRETATIONS ARE ILLIMITABLE AND IN GIRLS OF SWEET ARDENTNATURE EVERY SIGN IS APT TO CONJURE UP WONDER HOPE BELIEF VAST AS ASKY AND COLORED BY A DIFFUSED THIMBLEFUL OF MATTER IN THE SHAPE OFKNOWLEDGE
 THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS TOO GROSSLY DECEIVED FOR SINBAD HIMSELFMAY HAVE FALLEN BY GOODLUCK ON A TRUE DESCRIPTION AND WRONG REASONINGSOMETIMES LANDS POOR MORTALS IN RIGHT CONCLUSIONS STARTING A LONG WAYOFF THE TRUE POINT AND PROCEEDING BY LOOPS AND ZIGZAGS WE NOW ANDTHEN ARRIVE JUST WHERE WE OUGHT TO BE
 BECAUSE MISS BROOKE WAS HASTY INHER TRUST IT IS NOT THEREFORE CLEAR THAT MR
 CASAUBON WAS UNWORTHY OFIT
HE STAYED A LITTLE LONGER THAN HE HAD INTENDED ON A SLIGHT PRESSURE OFINVITATION FROM MR
 BROOKE WHO OFFERED NO BAIT EXCEPT HIS OWNDOCUMENTS ON MACHINEBREAKING AND RICKBURNING
 MR
 CASAUBON WAS CALLEDINTO THE LIBRARY TO LOOK AT THESE IN A HEAP WHILE HIS HOST PICKED UPFIRST ONE AND THEN THE OTHER TO READ ALOUD FROM IN A SKIPPING ANDUNCERTAIN WAY PASSING FROM ONE UNFINISHED PASSAGE TO ANOTHER WITH AYES NOW BUT HERE
 AND FINALLY PUSHING THEM ALL ASIDE TO OPEN THEJOURNAL OF HIS YOUTHFUL CONTINENTAL TRAVELS
LOOK HEREHERE IS ALL ABOUT GREECE
 RHAMNUS THE RUINS OF RHAMNUSYOUARE A GREAT GRECIAN NOW
 I DONT KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE GIVEN MUCHSTUDY TO THE TOPOGRAPHY
 I SPENT NO END OF TIME IN MAKING OUT THESETHINGSHELICON NOW
 HERE NOW
WE STARTED THE NEXT MORNING FORPARNASSUS THE DOUBLEPEAKED PARNASSUS
 ALL THIS VOLUME IS ABOUTGREECE YOU KNOW MR
 BROOKE WOUND UP RUBBING HIS THUMB TRANSVERSELYALONG THE EDGES OF THE LEAVES AS HE HELD THE BOOK FORWARD
MR
 CASAUBON MADE A DIGNIFIED THOUGH SOMEWHAT SAD AUDIENCE BOWED INTHE RIGHT PLACE AND AVOIDED LOOKING AT ANYTHING DOCUMENTARY AS FAR ASPOSSIBLE WITHOUT SHOWING DISREGARD OR IMPATIENCE MINDFUL THAT THISDESULTORINESS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY ANDTHAT THE MAN WHO TOOK HIM ON THIS SEVERE MENTAL SCAMPER WAS NOT ONLY ANAMIABLE HOST BUT A LANDHOLDER AND CUSTOS ROTULORUM
 WAS HIS ENDURANCEAIDED ALSO BY THE REFLECTION THAT MR
 BROOKE WAS THE UNCLE OF DOROTHEA
CERTAINLY HE SEEMED MORE AND MORE BENT ON MAKING HER TALK TO HIM ONDRAWING HER OUT AS CELIA REMARKED TO HERSELF AND IN LOOKING AT HERHIS FACE WAS OFTEN LIT UP BY A SMILE LIKE PALE WINTRY SUNSHINE
 BEFOREHE LEFT THE NEXT MORNING WHILE TAKING A PLEASANT WALK WITH MISS BROOKEALONG THE GRAVELLED TERRACE HE HAD MENTIONED TO HER THAT HE FELT THEDISADVANTAGE OF LONELINESS THE NEED OF THAT CHEERFUL COMPANIONSHIPWITH WHICH THE PRESENCE OF YOUTH CAN LIGHTEN OR VARY THE SERIOUS TOILSOF MATURITY
 AND HE DELIVERED THIS STATEMENT WITH AS MUCH CAREFULPRECISION AS IF HE HAD BEEN A DIPLOMATIC ENVOY WHOSE WORDS WOULD BEATTENDED WITH RESULTS
 INDEED MR
 CASAUBON WAS NOT USED TO EXPECT THATHE SHOULD HAVE TO REPEAT OR REVISE HIS COMMUNICATIONS OF A PRACTICAL ORPERSONAL KIND
 THE INCLINATIONS WHICH HE HAD DELIBERATELY STATED ON THED OF OCTOBER HE WOULD THINK IT ENOUGH TO REFER TO BY THE MENTION OFTHAT DATE JUDGING BY THE STANDARD OF HIS OWN MEMORY WHICH WAS AVOLUME WHERE A VIDE SUPRA COULD SERVE INSTEAD OF REPETITIONS AND NOTTHE ORDINARY LONGUSED BLOTTINGBOOK WHICH ONLY TELLS OF FORGOTTENWRITING
 BUT IN THIS CASE MR
 CASAUBONS CONFIDENCE WAS NOT LIKELY TOBE FALSIFIED FOR DOROTHEA HEARD AND RETAINED WHAT HE SAID WITH THEEAGER INTEREST OF A FRESH YOUNG NATURE TO WHICH EVERY VARIETY INEXPERIENCE IS AN EPOCH
IT WAS THREE OCLOCK IN THE BEAUTIFUL BREEZY AUTUMN DAY WHEN MR
CASAUBON DROVE OFF TO HIS RECTORY AT LOWICK ONLY FIVE MILES FROMTIPTON AND DOROTHEA WHO HAD ON HER BONNET AND SHAWL HURRIED ALONGTHE SHRUBBERY AND ACROSS THE PARK THAT SHE MIGHT WANDER THROUGH THEBORDERING WOOD WITH NO OTHER VISIBLE COMPANIONSHIP THAN THAT OF MONKTHE GREAT ST
 BERNARD DOG WHO ALWAYS TOOK CARE OF THE YOUNG LADIES INTHEIR WALKS
 THERE HAD RISEN BEFORE HER THE GIRLS VISION OF A POSSIBLEFUTURE FOR HERSELF TO WHICH SHE LOOKED FORWARD WITH TREMBLING HOPE ANDSHE WANTED TO WANDER ON IN THAT VISIONARY FUTURE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
SHE WALKED BRISKLY IN THE BRISK AIR THE COLOR ROSE IN HER CHEEKS ANDHER STRAW BONNET WHICH OUR CONTEMPORARIES MIGHT LOOK AT WITHCONJECTURAL CURIOSITY AS AT AN OBSOLETE FORM OF BASKET FELL A LITTLEBACKWARD
 SHE WOULD PERHAPS BE HARDLY CHARACTERIZED ENOUGH IF IT WEREOMITTED THAT SHE WORE HER BROWN HAIR FLATLY BRAIDED AND COILED BEHINDSO AS TO EXPOSE THE OUTLINE OF HER HEAD IN A DARING MANNER AT A TIMEWHEN PUBLIC FEELING REQUIRED THE MEAGRENESS OF NATURE TO BEDISSIMULATED BY TALL BARRICADES OF FRIZZED CURLS AND BOWS NEVERSURPASSED BY ANY GREAT RACE EXCEPT THE FEEJEEAN
 THIS WAS A TRAIT OFMISS BROOKES ASCETICISM
 BUT THERE WAS NOTHING OF AN ASCETICSEXPRESSION IN HER BRIGHT FULL EYES AS SHE LOOKED BEFORE HER NOTCONSCIOUSLY SEEING BUT ABSORBING INTO THE INTENSITY OF HER MOOD THESOLEMN GLORY OF THE AFTERNOON WITH ITS LONG SWATHES OF LIGHT BETWEENTHE FAROFF ROWS OF LIMES WHOSE SHADOWS TOUCHED EACH OTHER
ALL PEOPLE YOUNG OR OLD THAT IS ALL PEOPLE IN THOSE ANTEREFORMTIMES WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HER AN INTERESTING OBJECT IF THEY HADREFERRED THE GLOW IN HER EYES AND CHEEKS TO THE NEWLY AWAKENED ORDINARYIMAGES OF YOUNG LOVE THE ILLUSIONS OF CHLOE ABOUT STREPHON HAVE BEENSUFFICIENTLY CONSECRATED IN POETRY AS THE PATHETIC LOVELINESS OF ALLSPONTANEOUS TRUST OUGHT TO BE
 MISS PIPPIN ADORING YOUNG PUMPKIN ANDDREAMING ALONG ENDLESS VISTAS OF UNWEARYING COMPANIONSHIP WAS A LITTLEDRAMA WHICH NEVER TIRED OUR FATHERS AND MOTHERS AND HAD BEEN PUT INTOALL COSTUMES
 LET BUT PUMPKIN HAVE A FIGURE WHICH WOULD SUSTAIN THEDISADVANTAGES OF THE SHORTWAISTED SWALLOWTAIL AND EVERYBODY FELT ITNOT ONLY NATURAL BUT NECESSARY TO THE PERFECTION OF WOMANHOOD THAT ASWEET GIRL SHOULD BE AT ONCE CONVINCED OF HIS VIRTUE HIS EXCEPTIONALABILITY AND ABOVE ALL HIS PERFECT SINCERITY
 BUT PERHAPS NO PERSONSTHEN LIVINGCERTAINLY NONE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF TIPTONWOULD HAVE HADA SYMPATHETIC UNDERSTANDING FOR THE DREAMS OF A GIRL WHOSE NOTIONSABOUT MARRIAGE TOOK THEIR COLOR ENTIRELY FROM AN EXALTED ENTHUSIASMABOUT THE ENDS OF LIFE AN ENTHUSIASM WHICH WAS LIT CHIEFLY BY ITS OWNFIRE AND INCLUDED NEITHER THE NICETIES OF THE TROUSSEAU THE PATTERNOF PLATE NOR EVEN THE HONORS AND SWEET JOYS OF THE BLOOMING MATRON
IT HAD NOW ENTERED DOROTHEAS MIND THAT MR
 CASAUBON MIGHT WISH TO MAKEHER HIS WIFE AND THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD DO SO TOUCHED HER WITH A SORTOF REVERENTIAL GRATITUDE
 HOW GOOD OF HIMNAY IT WOULD BE ALMOST AS IFA WINGED MESSENGER HAD SUDDENLY STOOD BESIDE HER PATH AND HELD OUT HISHAND TOWARDS HER
 FOR A LONG WHILE SHE HAD BEEN OPPRESSED BY THEINDEFINITENESS WHICH HUNG IN HER MIND LIKE A THICK SUMMER HAZE OVERALL HER DESIRE TO MAKE HER LIFE GREATLY EFFECTIVE
 WHAT COULD SHE DOWHAT OUGHT SHE TO DO
SHE HARDLY MORE THAN A BUDDING WOMAN BUT YETWITH AN ACTIVE CONSCIENCE AND A GREAT MENTAL NEED NOT TO BE SATISFIEDBY A GIRLISH INSTRUCTION COMPARABLE TO THE NIBBLINGS AND JUDGMENTS OF ADISCURSIVE MOUSE
 WITH SOME ENDOWMENT OF STUPIDITY AND CONCEIT SHEMIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT A CHRISTIAN YOUNG LADY OF FORTUNE SHOULD FINDHER IDEAL OF LIFE IN VILLAGE CHARITIES PATRONAGE OF THE HUMBLERCLERGY THE PERUSAL OF FEMALE SCRIPTURE CHARACTERS UNFOLDING THEPRIVATE EXPERIENCE OF SARA UNDER THE OLD DISPENSATION AND DORCAS UNDERTHE NEW AND THE CARE OF HER SOUL OVER HER EMBROIDERY IN HER OWNBOUDOIRWITH A BACKGROUND OF PROSPECTIVE MARRIAGE TO A MAN WHO IF LESSSTRICT THAN HERSELF AS BEING INVOLVED IN AFFAIRS RELIGIOUSLYINEXPLICABLE MIGHT BE PRAYED FOR AND SEASONABLY EXHORTED
 FROM SUCHCONTENTMENT POOR DOROTHEA WAS SHUT OUT
 THE INTENSITY OF HER RELIGIOUSDISPOSITION THE COERCION IT EXERCISED OVER HER LIFE WAS BUT ONEASPECT OF A NATURE ALTOGETHER ARDENT THEORETIC AND INTELLECTUALLYCONSEQUENT AND WITH SUCH A NATURE STRUGGLING IN THE BANDS OF A NARROWTEACHING HEMMED IN BY A SOCIAL LIFE WHICH SEEMED NOTHING BUT ALABYRINTH OF PETTY COURSES A WALLEDIN MAZE OF SMALL PATHS THAT LED NOWHITHER THE OUTCOME WAS SURE TO STRIKE OTHERS AS AT ONCE EXAGGERATIONAND INCONSISTENCY
 THE THING WHICH SEEMED TO HER BEST SHE WANTED TOJUSTIFY BY THE COMPLETEST KNOWLEDGE AND NOT TO LIVE IN A PRETENDEDADMISSION OF RULES WHICH WERE NEVER ACTED ON
 INTO THIS SOULHUNGER ASYET ALL HER YOUTHFUL PASSION WAS POURED THE UNION WHICH ATTRACTED HERWAS ONE THAT WOULD DELIVER HER FROM HER GIRLISH SUBJECTION TO HER OWNIGNORANCE AND GIVE HER THE FREEDOM OF VOLUNTARY SUBMISSION TO A GUIDEWHO WOULD TAKE HER ALONG THE GRANDEST PATH
I SHOULD LEARN EVERYTHING THEN SHE SAID TO HERSELF STILL WALKINGQUICKLY ALONG THE BRIDLE ROAD THROUGH THE WOOD
 IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TOSTUDY THAT I MIGHT HELP HIM THE BETTER IN HIS GREAT WORKS
 THERE WOULDBE NOTHING TRIVIAL ABOUT OUR LIVES
 EVERYDAY THINGS WITH US WOULD MEANTHE GREATEST THINGS
 IT WOULD BE LIKE MARRYING PASCAL
 I SHOULD LEARNTO SEE THE TRUTH BY THE SAME LIGHT AS GREAT MEN HAVE SEEN IT BY
 ANDTHEN I SHOULD KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN I GOT OLDER I SHOULD SEE HOW ITWAS POSSIBLE TO LEAD A GRAND LIFE HERENOWIN ENGLAND
 I DONT FEELSURE ABOUT DOING GOOD IN ANY WAY NOW EVERYTHING SEEMS LIKE GOING ON AMISSION TO A PEOPLE WHOSE LANGUAGE I DONT KNOWUNLESS IT WEREBUILDING GOOD COTTAGESTHERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT
 OH I HOPE ISHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THE PEOPLE WELL HOUSED IN LOWICK
 I WILL DRAWPLENTY OF PLANS WHILE I HAVE TIME
DOROTHEA CHECKED HERSELF SUDDENLY WITH SELFREBUKE FOR THE PRESUMPTUOUSWAY IN WHICH SHE WAS RECKONING ON UNCERTAIN EVENTS BUT SHE WAS SPAREDANY INWARD EFFORT TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF HER THOUGHTS BY THEAPPEARANCE OF A CANTERING HORSEMAN ROUND A TURNING OF THE ROAD
 THEWELLGROOMED CHESTNUT HORSE AND TWO BEAUTIFUL SETTERS COULD LEAVE NODOUBT THAT THE RIDER WAS SIR JAMES CHETTAM
 HE DISCERNED DOROTHEAJUMPED OFF HIS HORSE AT ONCE AND HAVING DELIVERED IT TO HIS GROOMADVANCED TOWARDS HER WITH SOMETHING WHITE ON HIS ARM AT WHICH THE TWOSETTERS WERE BARKING IN AN EXCITED MANNER
HOW DELIGHTFUL TO MEET YOU MISS BROOKE HE SAID RAISING HIS HAT ANDSHOWING HIS SLEEKLY WAVING BLOND HAIR
 IT HAS HASTENED THE PLEASURE IWAS LOOKING FORWARD TO
MISS BROOKE WAS ANNOYED AT THE INTERRUPTION
 THIS AMIABLE BARONETREALLY A SUITABLE HUSBAND FOR CELIA EXAGGERATED THE NECESSITY OFMAKING HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO THE ELDER SISTER
 EVEN A PROSPECTIVEBROTHERINLAW MAY BE AN OPPRESSION IF HE WILL ALWAYS BE PRESUPPOSINGTOO GOOD AN UNDERSTANDING WITH YOU AND AGREEING WITH YOU EVEN WHEN YOUCONTRADICT HIM
 THE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD MADE THE MISTAKE OF PAYING HISADDRESSES TO HERSELF COULD NOT TAKE SHAPE ALL HER MENTAL ACTIVITY WASUSED UP IN PERSUASIONS OF ANOTHER KIND
 BUT HE WAS POSITIVELY OBTRUSIVEAT THIS MOMENT AND HIS DIMPLED HANDS WERE QUITE DISAGREEABLE
 HERROUSED TEMPER MADE HER COLOR DEEPLY AS SHE RETURNED HIS GREETING WITHSOME HAUGHTINESS
SIR JAMES INTERPRETED THE HEIGHTENED COLOR IN THE WAY MOST GRATIFYINGTO HIMSELF AND THOUGHT HE NEVER SAW MISS BROOKE LOOKING SO HANDSOME
I HAVE BROUGHT A LITTLE PETITIONER HE SAID OR RATHER I HAVEBROUGHT HIM TO SEE IF HE WILL BE APPROVED BEFORE HIS PETITION ISOFFERED
 HE SHOWED THE WHITE OBJECT UNDER HIS ARM WHICH WAS A TINYMALTESE PUPPY ONE OF NATURES MOST NAIVE TOYS
IT IS PAINFUL TO ME TO SEE THESE CREATURES THAT ARE BRED MERELY ASPETS SAID DOROTHEA WHOSE OPINION WAS FORMING ITSELF THAT VERY MOMENTAS OPINIONS WILL UNDER THE HEAT OF IRRITATION
OH WHY
 SAID SIR JAMES AS THEY WALKED FORWARD
I BELIEVE ALL THE PETTING THAT IS GIVEN THEM DOES NOT MAKE THEM HAPPY
THEY ARE TOO HELPLESS THEIR LIVES ARE TOO FRAIL
 A WEASEL OR A MOUSETHAT GETS ITS OWN LIVING IS MORE INTERESTING
 I LIKE TO THINK THAT THEANIMALS ABOUT US HAVE SOULS SOMETHING LIKE OUR OWN AND EITHER CARRY ONTHEIR OWN LITTLE AFFAIRS OR CAN BE COMPANIONS TO US LIKE MONK HERE
THOSE CREATURES ARE PARASITIC
I AM SO GLAD I KNOW THAT YOU DO NOT LIKE THEM SAID GOOD SIR JAMES
I SHOULD NEVER KEEP THEM FOR MYSELF BUT LADIES USUALLY ARE FOND OFTHESE MALTESE DOGS
 HERE JOHN TAKE THIS DOG WILL YOU
THE OBJECTIONABLE PUPPY WHOSE NOSE AND EYES WERE EQUALLY BLACK ANDEXPRESSIVE WAS THUS GOT RID OF SINCE MISS BROOKE DECIDED THAT IT HADBETTER NOT HAVE BEEN BORN
 BUT SHE FELT IT NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN
YOU MUST NOT JUDGE OF CELIAS FEELING FROM MINE
 I THINK SHE LIKESTHESE SMALL PETS
 SHE HAD A TINY TERRIER ONCE WHICH SHE WAS VERY FONDOF
 IT MADE ME UNHAPPY BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID OF TREADING ON IT
 I AMRATHER SHORTSIGHTED
YOU HAVE YOUR OWN OPINION ABOUT EVERYTHING MISS BROOKE AND IT ISALWAYS A GOOD OPINION
WHAT ANSWER WAS POSSIBLE TO SUCH STUPID COMPLIMENTING
DO YOU KNOW I ENVY YOU THAT SIR JAMES SAID AS THEY CONTINUEDWALKING AT THE RATHER BRISK PACE SET BY DOROTHEA
I DONT QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN
YOUR POWER OF FORMING AN OPINION
 I CAN FORM AN OPINION OF PERSONS
 IKNOW WHEN I LIKE PEOPLE
 BUT ABOUT OTHER MATTERS DO YOU KNOW I HAVEOFTEN A DIFFICULTY IN DECIDING
 ONE HEARS VERY SENSIBLE THINGS SAID ONOPPOSITE SIDES
OR THAT SEEM SENSIBLE
 PERHAPS WE DONT ALWAYS DISCRIMINATE BETWEENSENSE AND NONSENSE
DOROTHEA FELT THAT SHE WAS RATHER RUDE
EXACTLY SAID SIR JAMES
 BUT YOU SEEM TO HAVE THE POWER OFDISCRIMINATION
ON THE CONTRARY I AM OFTEN UNABLE TO DECIDE
 BUT THAT IS FROMIGNORANCE
 THE RIGHT CONCLUSION IS THERE ALL THE SAME THOUGH I AMUNABLE TO SEE IT
I THINK THERE ARE FEW WHO WOULD SEE IT MORE READILY
 DO YOU KNOWLOVEGOOD WAS TELLING ME YESTERDAY THAT YOU HAD THE BEST NOTION IN THEWORLD OF A PLAN FOR COTTAGESQUITE WONDERFUL FOR A YOUNG LADY HETHOUGHT
 YOU HAD A REAL GENUS TO USE HIS EXPRESSION
 HE SAID YOUWANTED MR
 BROOKE TO BUILD A NEW SET OF COTTAGES BUT HE SEEMED TOTHINK IT HARDLY PROBABLE THAT YOUR UNCLE WOULD CONSENT
 DO YOU KNOWTHAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS I WISH TO DOI MEAN ON MY OWN ESTATE
 ISHOULD BE SO GLAD TO CARRY OUT THAT PLAN OF YOURS IF YOU WOULD LET MESEE IT
 OF COURSE IT IS SINKING MONEY THAT IS WHY PEOPLE OBJECT TOIT
 LABORERS CAN NEVER PAY RENT TO MAKE IT ANSWER
 BUT AFTER ALL ITIS WORTH DOING
WORTH DOING
 YES INDEED SAID DOROTHEA ENERGETICALLY FORGETTINGHER PREVIOUS SMALL VEXATIONS
 I THINK WE DESERVE TO BE BEATEN OUT OFOUR BEAUTIFUL HOUSES WITH A SCOURGE OF SMALL CORDSALL OF US WHO LETTENANTS LIVE IN SUCH STIES AS WE SEE ROUND US
 LIFE IN COTTAGES MIGHTBE HAPPIER THAN OURS IF THEY WERE REAL HOUSES FIT FOR HUMAN BEINGSFROM WHOM WE EXPECT DUTIES AND AFFECTIONS
WILL YOU SHOW ME YOUR PLAN
YES CERTAINLY
 I DARE SAY IT IS VERY FAULTY
 BUT I HAVE BEENEXAMINING ALL THE PLANS FOR COTTAGES IN LOUDONS BOOK AND PICKED OUTWHAT SEEM THE BEST THINGS
 OH WHAT A HAPPINESS IT WOULD BE TO SET THEPATTERN ABOUT HERE
 I THINK INSTEAD OF LAZARUS AT THE GATE WE SHOULDPUT THE PIGSTY COTTAGES OUTSIDE THE PARKGATE
DOROTHEA WAS IN THE BEST TEMPER NOW
 SIR JAMES AS BROTHER INLAWBUILDING MODEL COTTAGES ON HIS ESTATE AND THEN PERHAPS OTHERS BEINGBUILT AT LOWICK AND MORE AND MORE ELSEWHERE IN IMITATIONIT WOULD BEAS IF THE SPIRIT OF OBERLIN HAD PASSED OVER THE PARISHES TO MAKE THELIFE OF POVERTY BEAUTIFUL
SIR JAMES SAW ALL THE PLANS AND TOOK ONE AWAY TO CONSULT UPON WITHLOVEGOOD
 HE ALSO TOOK AWAY A COMPLACENT SENSE THAT HE WAS MAKING GREATPROGRESS IN MISS BROOKES GOOD OPINION
 THE MALTESE PUPPY WAS NOTOFFERED TO CELIA AN OMISSION WHICH DOROTHEA AFTERWARDS THOUGHT OF WITHSURPRISE BUT SHE BLAMED HERSELF FOR IT
 SHE HAD BEEN ENGROSSING SIRJAMES
 AFTER ALL IT WAS A RELIEF THAT THERE WAS NO PUPPY TO TREADUPON
CELIA WAS PRESENT WHILE THE PLANS WERE BEING EXAMINED AND OBSERVED SIRJAMESS ILLUSION
 HE THINKS THAT DODO CARES ABOUT HIM AND SHE ONLYCARES ABOUT HER PLANS
 YET I AM NOT CERTAIN THAT SHE WOULD REFUSE HIMIF SHE THOUGHT HE WOULD LET HER MANAGE EVERYTHING AND CARRY OUT ALL HERNOTIONS
 AND HOW VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SIR JAMES WOULD BE
 I CANNOT BEARNOTIONS
IT WAS CELIAS PRIVATE LUXURY TO INDULGE IN THIS DISLIKE
 SHE DARED NOTCONFESS IT TO HER SISTER IN ANY DIRECT STATEMENT FOR THAT WOULD BELAYING HERSELF OPEN TO A DEMONSTRATION THAT SHE WAS SOMEHOW OR OTHER ATWAR WITH ALL GOODNESS
 BUT ON SAFE OPPORTUNITIES SHE HAD AN INDIRECTMODE OF MAKING HER NEGATIVE WISDOM TELL UPON DOROTHEA AND CALLING HERDOWN FROM HER RHAPSODIC MOOD BY REMINDING HER THAT PEOPLE WERE STARINGNOT LISTENING
 CELIA WAS NOT IMPULSIVE WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY COULD WAITAND CAME FROM HER ALWAYS WITH THE SAME QUIET STACCATO EVENNESS
 WHENPEOPLE TALKED WITH ENERGY AND EMPHASIS SHE WATCHED THEIR FACES ANDFEATURES MERELY
 SHE NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND HOW WELLBRED PERSONSCONSENTED TO SING AND OPEN THEIR MOUTHS IN THE RIDICULOUS MANNERREQUISITE FOR THAT VOCAL EXERCISE
IT WAS NOT MANY DAYS BEFORE MR
 CASAUBON PAID A MORNING VISIT ON WHICHHE WAS INVITED AGAIN FOR THE FOLLOWING WEEK TO DINE AND STAY THE NIGHT
THUS DOROTHEA HAD THREE MORE CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM AND WAS CONVINCEDTHAT HER FIRST IMPRESSIONS HAD BEEN JUST
 HE WAS ALL SHE HAD AT FIRSTIMAGINED HIM TO BE ALMOST EVERYTHING HE HAD SAID SEEMED LIKE ASPECIMEN FROM A MINE OR THE INSCRIPTION ON THE DOOR OF A MUSEUM WHICHMIGHT OPEN ON THE TREASURES OF PAST AGES AND THIS TRUST IN HIS MENTALWEALTH WAS ALL THE DEEPER AND MORE EFFECTIVE ON HER INCLINATION BECAUSEIT WAS NOW OBVIOUS THAT HIS VISITS WERE MADE FOR HER SAKE
 THISACCOMPLISHED MAN CONDESCENDED TO THINK OF A YOUNG GIRL AND TAKE THEPAINS TO TALK TO HER NOT WITH ABSURD COMPLIMENT BUT WITH AN APPEAL TOHER UNDERSTANDING AND SOMETIMES WITH INSTRUCTIVE CORRECTION
 WHATDELIGHTFUL COMPANIONSHIP
 MR
 CASAUBON SEEMED EVEN UNCONSCIOUS THATTRIVIALITIES EXISTED AND NEVER HANDED ROUND THAT SMALLTALK OF HEAVYMEN WHICH IS AS ACCEPTABLE AS STALE BRIDECAKE BROUGHT FORTH WITH ANODOR OF CUPBOARD
 HE TALKED OF WHAT HE WAS INTERESTED IN OR ELSE HEWAS SILENT AND BOWED WITH SAD CIVILITY
 TO DOROTHEA THIS WAS ADORABLEGENUINENESS AND RELIGIOUS ABSTINENCE FROM THAT ARTIFICIALITY WHICHUSES UP THE SOUL IN THE EFFORTS OF PRETENCE
 FOR SHE LOOKED ASREVERENTLY AT MR
 CASAUBONS RELIGIOUS ELEVATION ABOVE HERSELF AS SHEDID AT HIS INTELLECT AND LEARNING
 HE ASSENTED TO HER EXPRESSIONS OFDEVOUT FEELING AND USUALLY WITH AN APPROPRIATE QUOTATION HE ALLOWEDHIMSELF TO SAY THAT HE HAD GONE THROUGH SOME SPIRITUAL CONFLICTS IN HISYOUTH IN SHORT DOROTHEA SAW THAT HERE SHE MIGHT RECKON ONUNDERSTANDING SYMPATHY AND GUIDANCE
 ON ONEONLY ONEOF HER FAVORITETHEMES SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED
 MR
 CASAUBON APPARENTLY DID NOT CARE ABOUTBUILDING COTTAGES AND DIVERTED THE TALK TO THE EXTREMELY NARROWACCOMMODATION WHICH WAS TO BE HAD IN THE DWELLINGS OF THE ANCIENTEGYPTIANS AS IF TO CHECK A TOO HIGH STANDARD
 AFTER HE WAS GONEDOROTHEA DWELT WITH SOME AGITATION ON THIS INDIFFERENCE OF HIS AND HERMIND WAS MUCH EXERCISED WITH ARGUMENTS DRAWN FROM THE VARYINGCONDITIONS OF CLIMATE WHICH MODIFY HUMAN NEEDS AND FROM THE ADMITTEDWICKEDNESS OF PAGAN DESPOTS
 SHOULD SHE NOT URGE THESE ARGUMENTS ON MR
CASAUBON WHEN HE CAME AGAIN
 BUT FURTHER REFLECTION TOLD HER THAT SHEWAS PRESUMPTUOUS IN DEMANDING HIS ATTENTION TO SUCH A SUBJECT HE WOULDNOT DISAPPROVE OF HER OCCUPYING HERSELF WITH IT IN LEISURE MOMENTS ASOTHER WOMEN EXPECTED TO OCCUPY THEMSELVES WITH THEIR DRESS ANDEMBROIDERYWOULD NOT FORBID IT WHENDOROTHEA FELT RATHER ASHAMED AS SHEDETECTED HERSELF IN THESE SPECULATIONS
 BUT HER UNCLE HAD BEEN INVITEDTO GO TO LOWICK TO STAY A COUPLE OF DAYS WAS IT REASONABLE TO SUPPOSETHAT MR
 CASAUBON DELIGHTED IN MR
 BROOKES SOCIETY FOR ITS OWN SAKEEITHER WITH OR WITHOUT DOCUMENTS
MEANWHILE THAT LITTLE DISAPPOINTMENT MADE HER DELIGHT THE MORE IN SIRJAMES CHETTAMS READINESS TO SET ON FOOT THE DESIRED IMPROVEMENTS
 HECAME MUCH OFTENER THAN MR
 CASAUBON AND DOROTHEA CEASED TO FIND HIMDISAGREEABLE SINCE HE SHOWED HIMSELF SO ENTIRELY IN EARNEST FOR HE HADALREADY ENTERED WITH MUCH PRACTICAL ABILITY INTO LOVEGOODS ESTIMATESAND WAS CHARMINGLY DOCILE
 SHE PROPOSED TO BUILD A COUPLE OF COTTAGESAND TRANSFER TWO FAMILIES FROM THEIR OLD CABINS WHICH COULD THEN BEPULLED DOWN SO THAT NEW ONES COULD BE BUILT ON THE OLD SITES
 SIRJAMES SAID EXACTLY AND SHE BORE THE WORD REMARKABLY WELL
CERTAINLY THESE MEN WHO HAD SO FEW SPONTANEOUS IDEAS MIGHT BE VERYUSEFUL MEMBERS OF SOCIETY UNDER GOOD FEMININE DIRECTION IF THEY WEREFORTUNATE IN CHOOSING THEIR SISTERSINLAW
 IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAYWHETHER THERE WAS OR WAS NOT A LITTLE WILFULNESS IN HER CONTINUINGBLIND TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT ANOTHER SORT OF CHOICE WAS IN QUESTION INRELATION TO HER
 BUT HER LIFE WAS JUST NOW FULL OF HOPE AND ACTION SHEWAS NOT ONLY THINKING OF HER PLANS BUT GETTING DOWN LEARNED BOOKS FROMTHE LIBRARY AND READING MANY THINGS HASTILY THAT SHE MIGHT BE A LITTLELESS IGNORANT IN TALKING TO MR
 CASAUBON ALL THE WHILE BEING VISITEDWITH CONSCIENTIOUS QUESTIONINGS WHETHER SHE WERE NOT EXALTING THESEPOOR DOINGS ABOVE MEASURE AND CONTEMPLATING THEM WITH THATSELFSATISFACTION WHICH WAS THE LAST DOOM OF IGNORANCE AND FOLLY
CHAPTER IV
ST GENT
 OUR DEEDS ARE FETTERS THAT WE FORGE OURSELVES
D GENT
 AY TRULY BUT I THINK IT IS THE WORLDTHAT BRINGS THE IRON
SIR JAMES SEEMS DETERMINED TO DO EVERYTHING YOU WISH SAID CELIA ASTHEY WERE DRIVING HOME FROM AN INSPECTION OF THE NEW BUILDINGSITE
HE IS A GOOD CREATURE AND MORE SENSIBLE THAN ANY ONE WOULD IMAGINESAID DOROTHEA INCONSIDERATELY
YOU MEAN THAT HE APPEARS SILLY
NO NO SAID DOROTHEA RECOLLECTING HERSELF AND LAYING HER HAND ONHER SISTERS A MOMENT BUT HE DOES NOT TALK EQUALLY WELL ON ALLSUBJECTS
I SHOULD THINK NONE BUT DISAGREEABLE PEOPLE DO SAID CELIA IN HERUSUAL PURRING WAY
 THEY MUST BE VERY DREADFUL TO LIVE WITH
 ONLYTHINK
 AT BREAKFAST AND ALWAYS
DOROTHEA LAUGHED
 O KITTY YOU ARE A WONDERFUL CREATURE
 SHE PINCHEDCELIAS CHIN BEING IN THE MOOD NOW TO THINK HER VERY WINNING ANDLOVELYFIT HEREAFTER TO BE AN ETERNAL CHERUB AND IF IT WERE NOTDOCTRINALLY WRONG TO SAY SO HARDLY MORE IN NEED OF SALVATION THAN ASQUIRREL
 OF COURSE PEOPLE NEED NOT BE ALWAYS TALKING WELL
 ONLY ONETELLS THE QUALITY OF THEIR MINDS WHEN THEY TRY TO TALK WELL
YOU MEAN THAT SIR JAMES TRIES AND FAILS
I WAS SPEAKING GENERALLY
 WHY DO YOU CATECHISE ME ABOUT SIR JAMES
 ITIS NOT THE OBJECT OF HIS LIFE TO PLEASE ME
NOW DODO CAN YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT
CERTAINLY
 HE THINKS OF ME AS A FUTURE SISTERTHAT IS ALL
 DOROTHEAHAD NEVER HINTED THIS BEFORE WAITING FROM A CERTAIN SHYNESS ON SUCHSUBJECTS WHICH WAS MUTUAL BETWEEN THE SISTERS UNTIL IT SHOULD BEINTRODUCED BY SOME DECISIVE EVENT
 CELIA BLUSHED BUT SAID AT ONCEPRAY DO NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE ANY LONGER DODO
 WHEN TANTRIPP WASBRUSHING MY HAIR THE OTHER DAY SHE SAID THAT SIR JAMESS MAN KNEW FROMMRS
 CADWALLADERS MAID THAT SIR JAMES WAS TO MARRY THE ELDEST MISSBROOKE
HOW CAN YOU LET TANTRIPP TALK SUCH GOSSIP TO YOU CELIA
 SAIDDOROTHEA INDIGNANTLY NOT THE LESS ANGRY BECAUSE DETAILS ASLEEP IN HERMEMORY WERE NOW AWAKENED TO CONFIRM THE UNWELCOME REVELATION
 YOU MUSTHAVE ASKED HER QUESTIONS
 IT IS DEGRADING
I SEE NO HARM AT ALL IN TANTRIPPS TALKING TO ME
 IT IS BETTER TO HEARWHAT PEOPLE SAY
 YOU SEE WHAT MISTAKES YOU MAKE BY TAKING UP NOTIONS
 IAM QUITE SURE THAT SIR JAMES MEANS TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER AND HEBELIEVES THAT YOU WILL ACCEPT HIM ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN SOPLEASED WITH HIM ABOUT THE PLANS
 AND UNCLE TOOI KNOW HE EXPECTS IT
EVERY ONE CAN SEE THAT SIR JAMES IS VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH YOU
THE REVULSION WAS SO STRONG AND PAINFUL IN DOROTHEAS MIND THAT THETEARS WELLED UP AND FLOWED ABUNDANTLY
 ALL HER DEAR PLANS WEREEMBITTERED AND SHE THOUGHT WITH DISGUST OF SIR JAMESS CONCEIVING THATSHE RECOGNIZED HIM AS HER LOVER
 THERE WAS VEXATION TOO ON ACCOUNT OFCELIA
HOW COULD HE EXPECT IT
 SHE BURST FORTH IN HER MOST IMPETUOUS MANNER
I HAVE NEVER AGREED WITH HIM ABOUT ANYTHING BUT THE COTTAGES I WASBARELY POLITE TO HIM BEFORE
BUT YOU HAVE BEEN SO PLEASED WITH HIM SINCE THEN HE HAS BEGUN TO FEELQUITE SURE THAT YOU ARE FOND OF HIM
FOND OF HIM CELIA
 HOW CAN YOU CHOOSE SUCH ODIOUS EXPRESSIONS
 SAIDDOROTHEA PASSIONATELY
DEAR ME DOROTHEA I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE RIGHT FOR YOU TO BE FOND OF AMAN WHOM YOU ACCEPTED FOR A HUSBAND
IT IS OFFENSIVE TO ME TO SAY THAT SIR JAMES COULD THINK I WAS FOND OFHIM
 BESIDES IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WORD FOR THE FEELING I MUST HAVETOWARDS THE MAN I WOULD ACCEPT AS A HUSBAND
WELL I AM SORRY FOR SIR JAMES
 I THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO TELL YOUBECAUSE YOU WENT ON AS YOU ALWAYS DO NEVER LOOKING JUST WHERE YOU AREAND TREADING IN THE WRONG PLACE
 YOU ALWAYS SEE WHAT NOBODY ELSE SEESIT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SATISFY YOU YET YOU NEVER SEE WHAT IS QUITE PLAIN
THATS YOUR WAY DODO
 SOMETHING CERTAINLY GAVE CELIA UNUSUAL COURAGEAND SHE WAS NOT SPARING THE SISTER OF WHOM SHE WAS OCCASIONALLY IN AWE
WHO CAN TELL WHAT JUST CRITICISMS MURR THE CAT MAY BE PASSING ON USBEINGS OF WIDER SPECULATION
IT IS VERY PAINFUL SAID DOROTHEA FEELING SCOURGED
 I CAN HAVE NOMORE TO DO WITH THE COTTAGES
 I MUST BE UNCIVIL TO HIM
 I MUST TELL HIMI WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM
 IT IS VERY PAINFUL
 HER EYESFILLED AGAIN WITH TEARS
WAIT A LITTLE
 THINK ABOUT IT
 YOU KNOW HE IS GOING AWAY FOR A DAY ORTWO TO SEE HIS SISTER
 THERE WILL BE NOBODY BESIDES LOVEGOOD
 CELIACOULD NOT HELP RELENTING
 POOR DODO SHE WENT ON IN AN AMIABLESTACCATO
 IT IS VERY HARD IT IS YOUR FAVORITE FAD TO DRAW PLANS
FAD TO DRAW PLANS
 DO YOU THINK I ONLY CARE ABOUT MYFELLOWCREATURES HOUSES IN THAT CHILDISH WAY
 I MAY WELL MAKEMISTAKES
 HOW CAN ONE EVER DO ANYTHING NOBLY CHRISTIAN LIVING AMONGPEOPLE WITH SUCH PETTY THOUGHTS
NO MORE WAS SAID DOROTHEA WAS TOO MUCH JARRED TO RECOVER HER TEMPERAND BEHAVE SO AS TO SHOW THAT SHE ADMITTED ANY ERROR IN HERSELF
 SHEWAS DISPOSED RATHER TO ACCUSE THE INTOLERABLE NARROWNESS AND THEPURBLIND CONSCIENCE OF THE SOCIETY AROUND HER AND CELIA WAS NO LONGERTHE ETERNAL CHERUB BUT A THORN IN HER SPIRIT A PINKANDWHITENULLIFIDIAN WORSE THAN ANY DISCOURAGING PRESENCE IN THE PILGRIMSPROGRESS
 THE FAD OF DRAWING PLANS
 WHAT WAS LIFE WORTHWHAT GREATFAITH WAS POSSIBLE WHEN THE WHOLE EFFECT OF ONES ACTIONS COULD BEWITHERED UP INTO SUCH PARCHED RUBBISH AS THAT
 WHEN SHE GOT OUT OF THECARRIAGE HER CHEEKS WERE PALE AND HER EYELIDS RED
 SHE WAS AN IMAGE OFSORROW AND HER UNCLE WHO MET HER IN THE HALL WOULD HAVE BEEN ALARMEDIF CELIA HAD NOT BEEN CLOSE TO HER LOOKING SO PRETTY AND COMPOSED THATHE AT ONCE CONCLUDED DOROTHEAS TEARS TO HAVE THEIR ORIGIN IN HEREXCESSIVE RELIGIOUSNESS
 HE HAD RETURNED DURING THEIR ABSENCE FROM AJOURNEY TO THE COUNTY TOWN ABOUT A PETITION FOR THE PARDON OF SOMECRIMINAL
WELL MY DEARS HE SAID KINDLY AS THEY WENT UP TO KISS HIM I HOPENOTHING DISAGREEABLE HAS HAPPENED WHILE I HAVE BEEN AWAY
NO UNCLE SAID CELIA WE HAVE BEEN TO FRESHITT TO LOOK AT THECOTTAGES
 WE THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN AT HOME TO LUNCH
I CAME BY LOWICK TO LUNCHYOU DIDNT KNOW I CAME BY LOWICK
 AND I HAVEBROUGHT A COUPLE OF PAMPHLETS FOR YOU DOROTHEAIN THE LIBRARY YOUKNOW THEY LIE ON THE TABLE IN THE LIBRARY
IT SEEMED AS IF AN ELECTRIC STREAM WENT THROUGH DOROTHEA THRILLING HERFROM DESPAIR INTO EXPECTATION
 THEY WERE PAMPHLETS ABOUT THE EARLYCHURCH
 THE OPPRESSION OF CELIA TANTRIPP AND SIR JAMES WAS SHAKENOFF AND SHE WALKED STRAIGHT TO THE LIBRARY
 CELIA WENT UPSTAIRS
 MR
BROOKE WAS DETAINED BY A MESSAGE BUT WHEN HE REENTERED THE LIBRARYHE FOUND DOROTHEA SEATED AND ALREADY DEEP IN ONE OF THE PAMPHLETS WHICHHAD SOME MARGINAL MANUSCRIPT OF MR
 CASAUBONSTAKING IT IN AS EAGERLYAS SHE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN IN THE SCENT OF A FRESH BOUQUET AFTER A DRYHOT DREARY WALK
SHE WAS GETTING AWAY FROM TIPTON AND FRESHITT AND HER OWN SADLIABILITY TO TREAD IN THE WRONG PLACES ON HER WAY TO THE NEW JERUSALEM
MR
 BROOKE SAT DOWN IN HIS ARMCHAIR STRETCHED HIS LEGS TOWARDS THEWOODFIRE WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO A WONDROUS MASS OF GLOWING DICEBETWEEN THE DOGS AND RUBBED HIS HANDS GENTLY LOOKING VERY MILDLYTOWARDS DOROTHEA BUT WITH A NEUTRAL LEISURELY AIR AS IF HE HADNOTHING PARTICULAR TO SAY
 DOROTHEA CLOSED HER PAMPHLET AS SOON AS SHEWAS AWARE OF HER UNCLES PRESENCE AND ROSE AS IF TO GO
 USUALLY SHEWOULD HAVE BEEN INTERESTED ABOUT HER UNCLES MERCIFUL ERRAND ON BEHALFOF THE CRIMINAL BUT HER LATE AGITATION HAD MADE HER ABSENTMINDED
I CAME BACK BY LOWICK YOU KNOW SAID MR
 BROOKE NOT AS IF WITH ANYINTENTION TO ARREST HER DEPARTURE BUT APPARENTLY FROM HIS USUALTENDENCY TO SAY WHAT HE HAD SAID BEFORE
 THIS FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OFHUMAN SPEECH WAS MARKEDLY EXHIBITED IN MR
 BROOKE
 I LUNCHED THERE ANDSAW CASAUBONS LIBRARY AND THAT KIND OF THING
 THERES A SHARP AIRDRIVING
 WONT YOU SIT DOWN MY DEAR
 YOU LOOK COLD
DOROTHEA FELT QUITE INCLINED TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION
 SOME TIMES WHENHER UNCLES EASY WAY OF TAKING THINGS DID NOT HAPPEN TO BEEXASPERATING IT WAS RATHER SOOTHING
 SHE THREW OFF HER MANTLE ANDBONNET AND SAT DOWN OPPOSITE TO HIM ENJOYING THE GLOW BUT LIFTING UPHER BEAUTIFUL HANDS FOR A SCREEN
 THEY WERE NOT THIN HANDS OR SMALLHANDS BUT POWERFUL FEMININE MATERNAL HANDS
 SHE SEEMED TO BE HOLDINGTHEM UP IN PROPITIATION FOR HER PASSIONATE DESIRE TO KNOW AND TO THINKWHICH IN THE UNFRIENDLY MEDIUMS OF TIPTON AND FRESHITT HAD ISSUED INCRYING AND RED EYELIDS

 BUT I DIDNTTHINK IT NECESSARY TO GO INTO EVERYTHING
 HOWEVER THE LONG AND THESHORT OF IT IS THAT HE HAS ASKED MY PERMISSION TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER OFMARRIAGEOF MARRIAGE YOU KNOW SAID MR
 BROOKE WITH HIS EXPLANATORYNOD
 I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO TELL YOU MY DEAR
NO ONE COULD HAVE DETECTED ANY ANXIETY IN MR
 BROOKES MANNER BUT HEDID REALLY WISH TO KNOW SOMETHING OF HIS NIECES MIND THAT IF THEREWERE ANY NEED FOR ADVICE HE MIGHT GIVE IT IN TIME
 WHAT FEELING HE ASA MAGISTRATE WHO HAD TAKEN IN SO MANY IDEAS COULD MAKE ROOM FOR WASUNMIXEDLY KIND

 BUT NOW CHETTAM IS A GOODMATCH
 AND OUR LAND LIES TOGETHER
 I SHALL NEVER INTERFERE AGAINST YOURWISHES MY DEAR
 PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THEIR OWN WAY IN MARRIAGE AND THATSORT OF THINGUP TO A CERTAIN POINT YOU KNOW
 I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THATUP TO A CERTAIN POINT
 I WISH YOU TO MARRY WELL AND I HAVE GOOD REASONTO BELIEVE THAT CHETTAM WISHES TO MARRY YOU
 I MENTION IT YOU KNOW
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD EVER MARRY SIR JAMES CHETTAM SAIDDOROTHEA
 IF HE THINKS OF MARRYING ME HE HAS MADE A GREAT MISTAKE
THAT IS IT YOU SEE
 ONE NEVER KNOWS
 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT CHETTAMWAS JUST THE SORT OF MAN A WOMAN WOULD LIKE NOW
PRAY DO NOT MENTION HIM IN THAT LIGHT AGAIN UNCLE SAID DOROTHEAFEELING SOME OF HER LATE IRRITATION REVIVE
MR
 BROOKE WONDERED AND FELT THAT WOMEN WERE AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SUBJECTOF STUDY SINCE EVEN HE AT HIS AGE WAS NOT IN A PERFECT STATE OFSCIENTIFIC PREDICTION ABOUT THEM
 HERE WAS A FELLOW LIKE CHETTAM WITHNO CHANCE AT ALL
WELL BUT CASAUBON NOW
 THERE IS NO HURRYI MEAN FOR YOU
 ITS TRUEEVERY YEAR WILL TELL UPON HIM

 STILL HE IS NOT YOUNGAND I MUST NOT CONCEAL FROM YOU MY DEAR THAT I THINK HIS HEALTH ISNOT OVERSTRONG
 I KNOW NOTHING ELSE AGAINST HIM
I SHOULD NOT WISH TO HAVE A HUSBAND VERY NEAR MY OWN AGE SAIDDOROTHEA WITH GRAVE DECISION
 I SHOULD WISH TO HAVE A HUSBAND WHO WASABOVE ME IN JUDGMENT AND IN ALL KNOWLEDGE
MR
 BROOKE REPEATED HIS SUBDUED AH
I THOUGHT YOU HAD MORE OF YOUROWN OPINION THAN MOST GIRLS
 I THOUGHT YOU LIKED YOUR OWN OPINIONLIKEDIT YOU KNOW
I CANNOT IMAGINE MYSELF LIVING WITHOUT SOME OPINIONS BUT I SHOULDWISH TO HAVE GOOD REASONS FOR THEM AND A WISE MAN COULD HELP ME TO SEEWHICH OPINIONS HAD THE BEST FOUNDATION AND WOULD HELP ME TO LIVEACCORDING TO THEM
VERY TRUE
 YOU COULDNT PUT THE THING BETTERCOULDNT PUT IT BETTERBEFOREHAND YOU KNOW
 BUT THERE ARE ODDITIES IN THINGS CONTINUED MR
BROOKE WHOSE CONSCIENCE WAS REALLY ROUSED TO DO THE BEST HE COULD FORHIS NIECE ON THIS OCCASION
 LIFE ISNT CAST IN A MOULDNOT CUT OUT BYRULE AND LINE AND THAT SORT OF THING
 I NEVER MARRIED MYSELF AND ITWILL BE THE BETTER FOR YOU AND YOURS
 THE FACT IS I NEVER LOVED ANYONE WELL ENOUGH TO PUT MYSELF INTO A NOOSE FOR THEM
 IT IS A NOOSEYOU KNOW
 TEMPER NOW
 THERE IS TEMPER
 AND A HUSBAND LIKES TO BEMASTER
I KNOW THAT I MUST EXPECT TRIALS UNCLE
 MARRIAGE IS A STATE OF HIGHERDUTIES
 I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT AS MERE PERSONAL EASE SAID POORDOROTHEA
WELL YOU ARE NOT FOND OF SHOW A GREAT ESTABLISHMENT BALLS DINNERSTHAT KIND OF THING
 I CAN SEE THAT CASAUBONS WAYS MIGHT SUIT YOUBETTER THAN CHETTAMS
 AND YOU SHALL DO AS YOU LIKE MY DEAR
 I WOULDNOT HINDER CASAUBON I SAID SO AT ONCE FOR THERE IS NO KNOWING HOWANYTHING MAY TURN OUT
 YOU HAVE NOT THE SAME TASTES AS EVERY YOUNGLADY AND A CLERGYMAN AND SCHOLARWHO MAY BE A BISHOPTHAT KIND OFTHINGMAY SUIT YOU BETTER THAN CHETTAM
 CHETTAM IS A GOOD FELLOW AGOOD SOUNDHEARTED FELLOW YOU KNOW BUT HE DOESNT GO MUCH INTO IDEAS
I DID WHEN I WAS HIS AGE
 BUT CASAUBONS EYES NOW
 I THINK HE HASHURT THEM A LITTLE WITH TOO MUCH READING
I SHOULD BE ALL THE HAPPIER UNCLE THE MORE ROOM THERE WAS FOR ME TOHELP HIM SAID DOROTHEA ARDENTLY
YOU HAVE QUITE MADE UP YOUR MIND I SEE
 WELL MY DEAR THE FACT IS IHAVE A LETTER FOR YOU IN MY POCKET
 MR
 BROOKE HANDED THE LETTER TODOROTHEA BUT AS SHE ROSE TO GO AWAY HE ADDED THERE IS NOT TOO MUCHHURRY MY DEAR
 THINK ABOUT IT YOU KNOW
WHEN DOROTHEA HAD LEFT HIM HE REFLECTED THAT HE HAD CERTAINLY SPOKENSTRONGLY HE HAD PUT THE RISKS OF MARRIAGE BEFORE HER IN A STRIKINGMANNER
 IT WAS HIS DUTY TO DO SO
 BUT AS TO PRETENDING TO BE WISE FORYOUNG PEOPLENO UNCLE HOWEVER MUCH HE HAD TRAVELLED IN HIS YOUTHABSORBED THE NEW IDEAS AND DINED WITH CELEBRITIES NOW DECEASED COULDPRETEND TO JUDGE WHAT SORT OF MARRIAGE WOULD TURN OUT WELL FOR A YOUNGGIRL WHO PREFERRED CASAUBON TO CHETTAM
 IN SHORT WOMAN WAS A PROBLEMWHICH SINCE MR
 BROOKES MIND FELT BLANK BEFORE IT COULD BE HARDLYLESS COMPLICATED THAN THE REVOLUTIONS OF AN IRREGULAR SOLID

THIS WAS MR
 CASAUBONS LETTER
MY DEAR MISS BROOKEI HAVE YOUR GUARDIANS PERMISSION TO ADDRESS YOUON A SUBJECT THAN WHICH I HAVE NONE MORE AT HEART
 I AM NOT I TRUSTMISTAKEN IN THE RECOGNITION OF SOME DEEPER CORRESPONDENCE THAN THAT OFDATE IN THE FACT THAT A CONSCIOUSNESS OF NEED IN MY OWN LIFE HAD ARISENCONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF MY BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITHYOU
 FOR IN THE FIRST HOUR OF MEETING YOU I HAD AN IMPRESSION OF YOUREMINENT AND PERHAPS EXCLUSIVE FITNESS TO SUPPLY THAT NEED CONNECTED IMAY SAY WITH SUCH ACTIVITY OF THE AFFECTIONS AS EVEN THEPREOCCUPATIONS OF A WORK TOO SPECIAL TO BE ABDICATED COULD NOTUNINTERRUPTEDLY DISSIMULATE AND EACH SUCCEEDING OPPORTUNITY FOROBSERVATION HAS GIVEN THE IMPRESSION AN ADDED DEPTH BY CONVINCING MEMORE EMPHATICALLY OF THAT FITNESS WHICH I HAD PRECONCEIVED AND THUSEVOKING MORE DECISIVELY THOSE AFFECTIONS TO WHICH I HAVE BUT NOWREFERRED
 OUR CONVERSATIONS HAVE I THINK MADE SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR TOYOU THE TENOR OF MY LIFE AND PURPOSES A TENOR UNSUITED I AM AWARE TOTHE COMMONER ORDER OF MINDS
 BUT I HAVE DISCERNED IN YOU AN ELEVATIONOF THOUGHT AND A CAPABILITY OF DEVOTEDNESS WHICH I HAD HITHERTO NOTCONCEIVED TO BE COMPATIBLE EITHER WITH THE EARLY BLOOM OF YOUTH OR WITHTHOSE GRACES OF SEX THAT MAY BE SAID AT ONCE TO WIN AND TO CONFERDISTINCTION WHEN COMBINED AS THEY NOTABLY ARE IN YOU WITH THE MENTALQUALITIES ABOVE INDICATED
 IT WAS I CONFESS BEYOND MY HOPE TO MEETWITH THIS RARE COMBINATION OF ELEMENTS BOTH SOLID AND ATTRACTIVEADAPTED TO SUPPLY AID IN GRAVER LABORS AND TO CAST A CHARM OVER VACANTHOURS AND BUT FOR THE EVENT OF MY INTRODUCTION TO YOU WHICH LET MEAGAIN SAY I TRUST NOT TO BE SUPERFICIALLY COINCIDENT WITHFORESHADOWING NEEDS BUT PROVIDENTIALLY RELATED THERETO AS STAGESTOWARDS THE COMPLETION OF A LIFES PLAN I SHOULD PRESUMABLY HAVE GONEON TO THE LAST WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT TO LIGHTEN MY SOLITARINESS BY AMATRIMONIAL UNION
    SUCH MY DEAR MISS BROOKE IS THE ACCURATE STATEMENT OF MY    FEELINGS AND I RELY ON YOUR KIND INDULGENCE IN VENTURING NOW TO    ASK YOU HOW FAR YOUR OWN ARE OF A NATURE TO CONFIRM MY HAPPY    PRESENTIMENT
 TO BE ACCEPTED BY YOU AS YOUR HUSBAND AND THE EARTHLY    GUARDIAN OF YOUR WELFARE I SHOULD REGARD AS THE HIGHEST OF    PROVIDENTIAL GIFTS
 IN RETURN I CAN AT LEAST OFFER YOU AN AFFECTION    HITHERTO UNWASTED AND THE FAITHFUL CONSECRATION OF A LIFE WHICH    HOWEVER SHORT IN THE SEQUEL HAS NO BACKWARD PAGES WHEREON IF YOU    CHOOSE TO TURN THEM YOU WILL FIND RECORDS SUCH AS MIGHT JUSTLY    CAUSE YOU EITHER BITTERNESS OR SHAME
 I AWAIT THE EXPRESSION OF    YOUR SENTIMENTS WITH AN ANXIETY WHICH IT WOULD BE THE PART OF    WISDOM WERE IT POSSIBLE TO DIVERT BY A MORE ARDUOUS LABOR THAN    USUAL
 BUT IN THIS ORDER OF EXPERIENCE I AM STILL YOUNG AND IN    LOOKING FORWARD TO AN UNFAVORABLE POSSIBILITY I CANNOT BUT FEEL    THAT RESIGNATION TO SOLITUDE WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT AFTER THE    TEMPORARY ILLUMINATION OF HOPE
IN ANY CASE I SHALL REMAIN    YOURS WITH SINCERE DEVOTION        EDWARD CASAUBON
DOROTHEA TREMBLED WHILE SHE READ THIS LETTER THEN SHE FELL ON HERKNEES BURIED HER FACE AND SOBBED
 SHE COULD NOT PRAY UNDER THE RUSHOF SOLEMN EMOTION IN WHICH THOUGHTS BECAME VAGUE AND IMAGES FLOATEDUNCERTAINLY SHE COULD BUT CAST HERSELF WITH A CHILDLIKE SENSE OFRECLINING IN THE LAP OF A DIVINE CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH SUSTAINED HEROWN
 SHE REMAINED IN THAT ATTITUDE TILL IT WAS TIME TO DRESS FORDINNER
HOW COULD IT OCCUR TO HER TO EXAMINE THE LETTER TO LOOK AT ITCRITICALLY AS A PROFESSION OF LOVE
 HER WHOLE SOUL WAS POSSESSED BY THEFACT THAT A FULLER LIFE WAS OPENING BEFORE HER SHE WAS A NEOPHYTEABOUT TO ENTER ON A HIGHER GRADE OF INITIATION
 SHE WAS GOING TO HAVEROOM FOR THE ENERGIES WHICH STIRRED UNEASILY UNDER THE DIMNESS ANDPRESSURE OF HER OWN IGNORANCE AND THE PETTY PEREMPTORINESS OF THEWORLDS HABITS
NOW SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO DEVOTE HERSELF TO LARGE YET DEFINITE DUTIESNOW SHE WOULD BE ALLOWED TO LIVE CONTINUALLY IN THE LIGHT OF A MINDTHAT SHE COULD REVERENCE
 THIS HOPE WAS NOT UNMIXED WITH THE GLOW OFPROUD DELIGHTTHE JOYOUS MAIDEN SURPRISE THAT SHE WAS CHOSEN BY THE MANWHOM HER ADMIRATION HAD CHOSEN
 ALL DOROTHEAS PASSION WAS TRANSFUSEDTHROUGH A MIND STRUGGLING TOWARDS AN IDEAL LIFE THE RADIANCE OF HERTRANSFIGURED GIRLHOOD FELL ON THE FIRST OBJECT THAT CAME WITHIN ITSLEVEL
 THE IMPETUS WITH WHICH INCLINATION BECAME RESOLUTION WASHEIGHTENED BY THOSE LITTLE EVENTS OF THE DAY WHICH HAD ROUSED HERDISCONTENT WITH THE ACTUAL CONDITIONS OF HER LIFE
AFTER DINNER WHEN CELIA WAS PLAYING AN AIR WITH VARIATIONS A SMALLKIND OF TINKLING WHICH SYMBOLIZED THE AESTHETIC PART OF THE YOUNGLADIES EDUCATION DOROTHEA WENT UP TO HER ROOM TO ANSWER MR
CASAUBONS LETTER
 WHY SHOULD SHE DEFER THE ANSWER
 SHE WROTE IT OVERTHREE TIMES NOT BECAUSE SHE WISHED TO CHANGE THE WORDING BUT BECAUSEHER HAND WAS UNUSUALLY UNCERTAIN AND SHE COULD NOT BEAR THAT MR
CASAUBON SHOULD THINK HER HANDWRITING BAD AND ILLEGIBLE
 SHE PIQUEDHERSELF ON WRITING A HAND IN WHICH EACH LETTER WAS DISTINGUISHABLEWITHOUT ANY LARGE RANGE OF CONJECTURE AND SHE MEANT TO MAKE MUCH USEOF THIS ACCOMPLISHMENT TO SAVE MR
 CASAUBONS EYES
 THREE TIMES SHEWROTE
MY DEAR MR
 CASAUBONI AM VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR LOVING ME ANDTHINKING ME WORTHY TO BE YOUR WIFE
 I CAN LOOK FORWARD TO NO BETTERHAPPINESS THAN THAT WHICH WOULD BE ONE WITH YOURS
 IF I SAID MORE ITWOULD ONLY BE THE SAME THING WRITTEN OUT AT GREATER LENGTH FOR ICANNOT NOW DWELL ON ANY OTHER THOUGHT THAN THAT I MAY BE THROUGH LIFEYOURS DEVOTEDLY    DOROTHEA BROOKE
LATER IN THE EVENING SHE FOLLOWED HER UNCLE INTO THE LIBRARY TO GIVEHIM THE LETTER THAT HE MIGHT SEND IT IN THE MORNING
 HE WAS SURPRISEDBUT HIS SURPRISE ONLY ISSUED IN A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE DURING WHICH HEPUSHED ABOUT VARIOUS OBJECTS ON HIS WRITINGTABLE AND FINALLY STOODWITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE HIS GLASSES ON HIS NOSE LOOKING AT THEADDRESS OF DOROTHEAS LETTER
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ENOUGH ABOUT THIS MY DEAR
 HE SAID AT LAST
THERE WAS NO NEED TO THINK LONG UNCLE
 I KNOW OF NOTHING TO MAKE MEVACILLATE
 IF I CHANGED MY MIND IT MUST BE BECAUSE OF SOMETHINGIMPORTANT AND ENTIRELY NEW TO ME
AH
THEN YOU HAVE ACCEPTED HIM
 THEN CHETTAM HAS NO CHANCE
 HASCHETTAM OFFENDED YOUOFFENDED YOU YOU KNOW
 WHAT IS IT YOU DONT LIKEIN CHETTAM
THERE IS NOTHING THAT I LIKE IN HIM SAID DOROTHEA RATHERIMPETUOUSLY
MR
 BROOKE THREW HIS HEAD AND SHOULDERS BACKWARD AS IF SOME ONE HADTHROWN A LIGHT MISSILE AT HIM
 DOROTHEA IMMEDIATELY FELT SOMESELFREBUKE AND SAIDI MEAN IN THE LIGHT OF A HUSBAND
 HE IS VERY KIND I THINKREALLY VERYGOOD ABOUT THE COTTAGES
 A WELLMEANING MAN
BUT YOU MUST HAVE A SCHOLAR AND THAT SORT OF THING
 WELL IT LIES ALITTLE IN OUR FAMILY
 I HAD IT MYSELFTHAT LOVE OF KNOWLEDGE AND GOINGINTO EVERYTHINGA LITTLE TOO MUCHIT TOOK ME TOO FAR THOUGH THAT SORTOF THING DOESNT OFTEN RUN IN THE FEMALELINE OR IT RUNS UNDERGROUNDLIKE THE RIVERS IN GREECE YOU KNOWIT COMES OUT IN THE SONS
 CLEVERSONS CLEVER MOTHERS
 I WENT A GOOD DEAL INTO THAT AT ONE TIME
HOWEVER MY DEAR I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT PEOPLE SHOULD DO AS THEY LIKEIN THESE THINGS UP TO A CERTAIN POINT
 I COULDNT AS YOUR GUARDIANHAVE CONSENTED TO A BAD MATCH
 BUT CASAUBON STANDS WELL HIS POSITIONIS GOOD
 I AM AFRAID CHETTAM WILL BE HURT THOUGH AND MRS
 CADWALLADERWILL BLAME ME
THAT EVENING OF COURSE CELIA KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED
 SHEATTRIBUTED DOROTHEAS ABSTRACTED MANNER AND THE EVIDENCE OF FURTHERCRYING SINCE THEY HAD GOT HOME TO THE TEMPER SHE HAD BEEN IN ABOUT SIRJAMES CHETTAM AND THE BUILDINGS AND WAS CAREFUL NOT TO GIVE FURTHEROFFENCE HAVING ONCE SAID WHAT SHE WANTED TO SAY CELIA HAD NODISPOSITION TO RECUR TO DISAGREEABLE SUBJECTS
 IT HAD BEEN HER NATUREWHEN A CHILD NEVER TO QUARREL WITH ANY ONEONLY TO OBSERVE WITH WONDERTHAT THEY QUARRELLED WITH HER AND LOOKED LIKE TURKEYCOCKS WHEREUPONSHE WAS READY TO PLAY AT CATS CRADLE WITH THEM WHENEVER THEY RECOVEREDTHEMSELVES
 AND AS TO DOROTHEA IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN HER WAY TO FINDSOMETHING WRONG IN HER SISTERS WORDS THOUGH CELIA INWARDLY PROTESTEDTHAT SHE ALWAYS SAID JUST HOW THINGS WERE AND NOTHING ELSE SHE NEVERDID AND NEVER COULD PUT WORDS TOGETHER OUT OF HER OWN HEAD
 BUT THEBEST OF DODO WAS THAT SHE DID NOT KEEP ANGRY FOR LONG TOGETHER
 NOWTHOUGH THEY HAD HARDLY SPOKEN TO EACH OTHER ALL THE EVENING YET WHENCELIA PUT BY HER WORK INTENDING TO GO TO BED A PROCEEDING IN WHICHSHE WAS ALWAYS MUCH THE EARLIER DOROTHEA WHO WAS SEATED ON A LOWSTOOL UNABLE TO OCCUPY HERSELF EXCEPT IN MEDITATION SAID WITH THEMUSICAL INTONATION WHICH IN MOMENTS OF DEEP BUT QUIET FEELING MADE HERSPEECH LIKE A FINE BIT OF RECITATIVECELIA DEAR COME AND KISS ME HOLDING HER ARMS OPEN AS SHE SPOKE
CELIA KNELT DOWN TO GET THE RIGHT LEVEL AND GAVE HER LITTLE BUTTERFLYKISS WHILE DOROTHEA ENCIRCLED HER WITH GENTLE ARMS AND PRESSED HERLIPS GRAVELY ON EACH CHEEK IN TURN
DONT SIT UP DODO YOU ARE SO PALE TONIGHT GO TO BED SOON SAIDCELIA IN A COMFORTABLE WAY WITHOUT ANY TOUCH OF PATHOS
NO DEAR I AM VERY VERY HAPPY SAID DOROTHEA FERVENTLY
SO MUCH THE BETTER THOUGHT CELIA
 BUT HOW STRANGELY DODO GOES FROMONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER
THE NEXT DAY AT LUNCHEON THE BUTLER HANDING SOMETHING TO MR
 BROOKESAID JONAS IS COME BACK SIR AND HAS BROUGHT THIS LETTER
MR
 BROOKE READ THE LETTER AND THEN NODDING TOWARD DOROTHEA SAIDCASAUBON MY DEAR HE WILL BE HERE TO DINNER HE DIDNT WAIT TO WRITEMOREDIDNT WAIT YOU KNOW
IT COULD NOT SEEM REMARKABLE TO CELIA THAT A DINNER GUEST SHOULD BEANNOUNCED TO HER SISTER BEFOREHAND BUT HER EYES FOLLOWING THE SAMEDIRECTION AS HER UNCLES SHE WAS STRUCK WITH THE PECULIAR EFFECT OFTHE ANNOUNCEMENT ON DOROTHEA
 IT SEEMED AS IF SOMETHING LIKE THEREFLECTION OF A WHITE SUNLIT WING HAD PASSED ACROSS HER FEATURESENDING IN ONE OF HER RARE BLUSHES
 FOR THE FIRST TIME IT ENTERED INTOCELIAS MIND THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING MORE BETWEEN MR
 CASAUBONAND HER SISTER THAN HIS DELIGHT IN BOOKISH TALK AND HER DELIGHT INLISTENING
 HITHERTO SHE HAD CLASSED THE ADMIRATION FOR THIS UGLY ANDLEARNED ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ADMIRATION FOR MONSIEUR LIRET ATLAUSANNE ALSO UGLY AND LEARNED
 DOROTHEA HAD NEVER BEEN TIRED OFLISTENING TO OLD MONSIEUR LIRET WHEN CELIAS FEET WERE AS COLD ASPOSSIBLE AND WHEN IT HAD REALLY BECOME DREADFUL TO SEE THE SKIN OF HISBALD HEAD MOVING ABOUT
 WHY THEN SHOULD HER ENTHUSIASM NOT EXTEND TOMR
 CASAUBON SIMPLY IN THE SAME WAY AS TO MONSIEUR LIRET
 AND IT SEEMEDPROBABLE THAT ALL LEARNED MEN HAD A SORT OF SCHOOLMASTERS VIEW OFYOUNG PEOPLE
BUT NOW CELIA WAS REALLY STARTLED AT THE SUSPICION WHICH HAD DARTEDINTO HER MIND
 SHE WAS SELDOM TAKEN BY SURPRISE IN THIS WAY HERMARVELLOUS QUICKNESS IN OBSERVING A CERTAIN ORDER OF SIGNS GENERALLYPREPARING HER TO EXPECT SUCH OUTWARD EVENTS AS SHE HAD AN INTEREST IN
NOT THAT SHE NOW IMAGINED MR
 CASAUBON TO BE ALREADY AN ACCEPTED LOVERSHE HAD ONLY BEGUN TO FEEL DISGUST AT THE POSSIBILITY THAT ANYTHING INDOROTHEAS MIND COULD TEND TOWARDS SUCH AN ISSUE
 HERE WAS SOMETHINGREALLY TO VEX HER ABOUT DODO IT WAS ALL VERY WELL NOT TO ACCEPT SIRJAMES CHETTAM BUT THE IDEA OF MARRYING MR
 CASAUBON
 CELIA FELT A SORTOF SHAME MINGLED WITH A SENSE OF THE LUDICROUS
 BUT PERHAPS DODO IFSHE WERE REALLY BORDERING ON SUCH AN EXTRAVAGANCE MIGHT BE TURNED AWAYFROM IT EXPERIENCE HAD OFTEN SHOWN THAT HER IMPRESSIBILITY MIGHT BECALCULATED ON
 THE DAY WAS DAMP AND THEY WERE NOT GOING TO WALK OUTSO THEY BOTH WENT UP TO THEIR SITTINGROOM AND THERE CELIA OBSERVEDTHAT DOROTHEA INSTEAD OF SETTLING DOWN WITH HER USUAL DILIGENTINTEREST TO SOME OCCUPATION SIMPLY LEANED HER ELBOW ON AN OPEN BOOKAND LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE GREAT CEDAR SILVERED WITH THE DAMP
SHE HERSELF HAD TAKEN UP THE MAKING OF A TOY FOR THE CURATES CHILDRENAND WAS NOT GOING TO ENTER ON ANY SUBJECT TOO PRECIPITATELY
DOROTHEA WAS IN FACT THINKING THAT IT WAS DESIRABLE FOR CELIA TO KNOWOF THE MOMENTOUS CHANGE IN MR
 CASAUBONS POSITION SINCE HE HAD LASTBEEN IN THE HOUSE IT DID NOT SEEM FAIR TO LEAVE HER IN IGNORANCE OFWHAT WOULD NECESSARILY AFFECT HER ATTITUDE TOWARDS HIM BUT IT WASIMPOSSIBLE NOT TO SHRINK FROM TELLING HER
 DOROTHEA ACCUSED HERSELF OFSOME MEANNESS IN THIS TIMIDITY IT WAS ALWAYS ODIOUS TO HER TO HAVE ANYSMALL FEARS OR CONTRIVANCES ABOUT HER ACTIONS BUT AT THIS MOMENT SHEWAS SEEKING THE HIGHEST AID POSSIBLE THAT SHE MIGHT NOT DREAD THECORROSIVENESS OF CELIAS PRETTY CARNALLY MINDED PROSE
 HER REVERIE WASBROKEN AND THE DIFFICULTY OF DECISION BANISHED BY CELIAS SMALL ANDRATHER GUTTURAL VOICE SPEAKING IN ITS USUAL TONE OF A REMARK ASIDE ORA BY THE BYE
IS ANY ONE ELSE COMING TO DINE BESIDES MR
 CASAUBON
NOT THAT I KNOW OF
I HOPE THERE IS SOME ONE ELSE
 THEN I SHALL NOT HEAR HIM EAT HIS SOUPSO
WHAT IS THERE REMARKABLE ABOUT HIS SOUPEATING
REALLY DODO CANT YOU HEAR HOW HE SCRAPES HIS SPOON
 AND HE ALWAYSBLINKS BEFORE HE SPEAKS
 I DONT KNOW WHETHER LOCKE BLINKED BUT IMSURE I AM SORRY FOR THOSE WHO SAT OPPOSITE TO HIM IF HE DID
CELIA SAID DOROTHEA WITH EMPHATIC GRAVITY PRAY DONT MAKE ANYMORE OBSERVATIONS OF THAT KIND
WHY NOT
 THEY ARE QUITE TRUE RETURNED CELIA WHO HAD HER REASONS FORPERSEVERING THOUGH SHE WAS BEGINNING TO BE A LITTLE AFRAID
MANY THINGS ARE TRUE WHICH ONLY THE COMMONEST MINDS OBSERVE
THEN I THINK THE COMMONEST MINDS MUST BE RATHER USEFUL
 I THINK IT ISA PITY MR
 CASAUBONS MOTHER HAD NOT A COMMONER MIND SHE MIGHT HAVETAUGHT HIM BETTER
 CELIA WAS INWARDLY FRIGHTENED AND READY TO RUNAWAY NOW SHE HAD HURLED THIS LIGHT JAVELIN
DOROTHEAS FEELINGS HAD GATHERED TO AN AVALANCHE AND THERE COULD BE NOFURTHER PREPARATION
IT IS RIGHT TO TELL YOU CELIA THAT I AM ENGAGED TO MARRY MR
CASAUBON
PERHAPS CELIA HAD NEVER TURNED SO PALE BEFORE
 THE PAPER MAN SHE WASMAKING WOULD HAVE HAD HIS LEG INJURED BUT FOR HER HABITUAL CARE OFWHATEVER SHE HELD IN HER HANDS
 SHE LAID THE FRAGILE FIGURE DOWN ATONCE AND SAT PERFECTLY STILL FOR A FEW MOMENTS
 WHEN SHE SPOKE THEREWAS A TEAR GATHERING
OH DODO I HOPE YOU WILL BE HAPPY
 HER SISTERLY TENDERNESS COULD NOTBUT SURMOUNT OTHER FEELINGS AT THIS MOMENT AND HER FEARS WERE THEFEARS OF AFFECTION
DOROTHEA WAS STILL HURT AND AGITATED
IT IS QUITE DECIDED THEN
 SAID CELIA IN AN AWED UNDER TONE
 ANDUNCLE KNOWS
I HAVE ACCEPTED MR
 CASAUBONS OFFER
 MY UNCLE BROUGHT ME THE LETTERTHAT CONTAINED IT HE KNEW ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND
I BEG YOUR PARDON IF I HAVE SAID ANYTHING TO HURT YOU DODO SAIDCELIA WITH A SLIGHT SOB
 SHE NEVER COULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT SHE SHOULDFEEL AS SHE DID
 THERE WAS SOMETHING FUNEREAL IN THE WHOLE AFFAIR ANDMR
 CASAUBON SEEMED TO BE THE OFFICIATING CLERGYMAN ABOUT WHOM ITWOULD BE INDECENT TO MAKE REMARKS
NEVER MIND KITTY DO NOT GRIEVE
 WE SHOULD NEVER ADMIRE THE SAMEPEOPLE
 I OFTEN OFFEND IN SOMETHING OF THE SAME WAY I AM APT TO SPEAKTOO STRONGLY OF THOSE WHO DONT PLEASE ME
IN SPITE OF THIS MAGNANIMITY DOROTHEA WAS STILL SMARTING PERHAPS ASMUCH FROM CELIAS SUBDUED ASTONISHMENT AS FROM HER SMALL CRITICISMS
 OFCOURSE ALL THE WORLD ROUND TIPTON WOULD BE OUT OF SYMPATHY WITH THISMARRIAGE
 DOROTHEA KNEW OF NO ONE WHO THOUGHT AS SHE DID ABOUT LIFE ANDITS BEST OBJECTS
NEVERTHELESS BEFORE THE EVENING WAS AT AN END SHE WAS VERY HAPPY
 IN ANHOURS TÊTEÀTÊTE WITH MR
 CASAUBON SHE TALKED TO HIM WITH MOREFREEDOM THAN SHE HAD EVER FELT BEFORE EVEN POURING OUT HER JOY AT THETHOUGHT OF DEVOTING HERSELF TO HIM AND OF LEARNING HOW SHE MIGHT BESTSHARE AND FURTHER ALL HIS GREAT ENDS
 MR
 CASAUBON WAS TOUCHED WITH ANUNKNOWN DELIGHT WHAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
 AT THIS CHILDLIKEUNRESTRAINED ARDOR HE WAS NOT SURPRISED WHAT LOVER WOULD HAVE BEEN
THAT HE SHOULD BE THE OBJECT OF IT
MY DEAR YOUNG LADYMISS BROOKEDOROTHEA
 HE SAID PRESSING HER HANDBETWEEN HIS HANDS THIS IS A HAPPINESS GREATER THAN I HAD EVERIMAGINED TO BE IN RESERVE FOR ME
 THAT I SHOULD EVER MEET WITH A MINDAND PERSON SO RICH IN THE MINGLED GRACES WHICH COULD RENDER MARRIAGEDESIRABLE WAS FAR INDEED FROM MY CONCEPTION
 YOU HAVE ALLNAY MORETHAN ALLTHOSE QUALITIES WHICH I HAVE EVER REGARDED AS THECHARACTERISTIC EXCELLENCES OF WOMANHOOD
 THE GREAT CHARM OF YOUR SEX ISITS CAPABILITY OF AN ARDENT SELFSACRIFICING AFFECTION AND HEREIN WESEE ITS FITNESS TO ROUND AND COMPLETE THE EXISTENCE OF OUR OWN
HITHERTO I HAVE KNOWN FEW PLEASURES SAVE OF THE SEVERER KIND MYSATISFACTIONS HAVE BEEN THOSE OF THE SOLITARY STUDENT
 I HAVE BEENLITTLE DISPOSED TO GATHER FLOWERS THAT WOULD WITHER IN MY HAND BUT NOWI SHALL PLUCK THEM WITH EAGERNESS TO PLACE THEM IN YOUR BOSOM
NO SPEECH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE THOROUGHLY HONEST IN ITS INTENTION THEFRIGID RHETORIC AT THE END WAS AS SINCERE AS THE BARK OF A DOG OR THECAWING OF AN AMOROUS ROOK
 WOULD IT NOT BE RASH TO CONCLUDE THAT THEREWAS NO PASSION BEHIND THOSE SONNETS TO DELIA WHICH STRIKE US AS THETHIN MUSIC OF A MANDOLIN
DOROTHEAS FAITH SUPPLIED ALL THAT MR
 CASAUBONS WORDS SEEMED TO LEAVEUNSAID WHAT BELIEVER SEES A DISTURBING OMISSION OR INFELICITY
 THETEXT WHETHER OF PROPHET OR OF POET EXPANDS FOR WHATEVER WE CAN PUTINTO IT AND EVEN HIS BAD GRAMMAR IS SUBLIME
I AM VERY IGNORANTYOU WILL QUITE WONDER AT MY IGNORANCE SAIDDOROTHEA
 I HAVE SO MANY THOUGHTS THAT MAY BE QUITE MISTAKEN AND NOWI SHALL BE ABLE TO TELL THEM ALL TO YOU AND ASK YOU ABOUT THEM
 BUTSHE ADDED WITH RAPID IMAGINATION OF MR
 CASAUBONS PROBABLE FEELINGI WILL NOT TROUBLE YOU TOO MUCH ONLY WHEN YOU ARE INCLINED TO LISTENTO ME
 YOU MUST OFTEN BE WEARY WITH THE PURSUIT OF SUBJECTS IN YOUR OWNTRACK
 I SHALL GAIN ENOUGH IF YOU WILL TAKE ME WITH YOU THERE
HOW SHOULD I BE ABLE NOW TO PERSEVERE IN ANY PATH WITHOUT YOURCOMPANIONSHIP
 SAID MR
 CASAUBON KISSING HER CANDID BROW AND FEELINGTHAT HEAVEN HAD VOUCHSAFED HIM A BLESSING IN EVERY WAY SUITED TO HISPECULIAR WANTS
 HE WAS BEING UNCONSCIOUSLY WROUGHT UPON BY THE CHARMSOF A NATURE WHICH WAS ENTIRELY WITHOUT HIDDEN CALCULATIONS EITHER FORIMMEDIATE EFFECTS OR FOR REMOTER ENDS
 IT WAS THIS WHICH MADE DOROTHEASO CHILDLIKE AND ACCORDING TO SOME JUDGES SO STUPID WITH ALL HERREPUTED CLEVERNESS AS FOR EXAMPLE IN THE PRESENT CASE OF THROWINGHERSELF METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING AT MR
 CASAUBONS FEET AND KISSINGHIS UNFASHIONABLE SHOETIES AS IF HE WERE A PROTESTANT POPE
 SHE WASNOT IN THE LEAST TEACHING MR
 CASAUBON TO ASK IF HE WERE GOOD ENOUGHFOR HER BUT MERELY ASKING HERSELF ANXIOUSLY HOW SHE COULD BE GOODENOUGH FOR MR
 CASAUBON
 BEFORE HE LEFT THE NEXT DAY IT HAD BEENDECIDED THAT THE MARRIAGE SHOULD TAKE PLACE WITHIN SIX WEEKS
 WHY NOT
MR
 CASAUBONS HOUSE WAS READY
 IT WAS NOT A PARSONAGE BUT ACONSIDERABLE MANSION WITH MUCH LAND ATTACHED TO IT
 THE PARSONAGE WASINHABITED BY THE CURATE WHO DID ALL THE DUTY EXCEPT PREACHING THEMORNING SERMON
CHAPTER VI
MY LADYS TONGUE IS LIKE THE MEADOW BLADESTHAT CUT YOU STROKING THEM WITH IDLE HAND
NICE CUTTING IS HER FUNCTION SHE DIVIDESWITH SPIRITUAL EDGE THE MILLETSEEDAND MAKES INTANGIBLE SAVINGS
AS MR
 CASAUBONS CARRIAGE WAS PASSING OUT OF THE GATEWAY IT ARRESTEDTHE ENTRANCE OF A PONY PHAETON DRIVEN BY A LADY WITH A SERVANT SEATEDBEHIND
 IT WAS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE RECOGNITION HAD BEEN MUTUAL FORMR
 CASAUBON WAS LOOKING ABSENTLY BEFORE HIM BUT THE LADY WASQUICKEYED AND THREW A NOD AND A HOW DO YOU DO
 IN THE NICK OF TIME
IN SPITE OF HER SHABBY BONNET AND VERY OLD INDIAN SHAWL IT WAS PLAINTHAT THE LODGEKEEPER REGARDED HER AS AN IMPORTANT PERSONAGE FROM THELOW CURTSY WHICH WAS DROPPED ON THE ENTRANCE OF THE SMALL PHAETON
WELL MRS
 FITCHETT HOW ARE YOUR FOWLS LAYING NOW
 SAID THEHIGHCOLORED DARKEYED LADY WITH THE CLEAREST CHISELLED UTTERANCE
PRETTY WELL FOR LAYING MADAM BUT THEYVE TAEN TO EATING THEIR EGGSIVE NO PEACE O MIND WITH EM AT ALL
OH THE CANNIBALS
 BETTER SELL THEM CHEAP AT ONCE
 WHAT WILL YOU SELLTHEM A COUPLE
 ONE CANT EAT FOWLS OF A BAD CHARACTER AT A HIGH PRICE
WELL MADAM HALFACROWN I COULDNT LET EM GO NOT UNDER
HALFACROWN THESE TIMES
 COME NOWFOR THE RECTORS CHICKENBROTH ONA SUNDAY
 HE HAS CONSUMED ALL OURS THAT I CAN SPARE
 YOU ARE HALF PAIDWITH THE SERMON MRS
 FITCHETT REMEMBER THAT
 TAKE A PAIR OFTUMBLERPIGEONS FOR THEMLITTLE BEAUTIES

WELL MADAM MASTER FITCHETT SHALL GO AND SEE EM AFTER WORK

OBLIGE ME
 IT WILL BE THE BEST BARGAIN HE EVER MADE
 A PAIR OF CHURCHPIGEONS FOR A COUPLE OF WICKED SPANISH FOWLS THAT EAT THEIR OWN EGGS
DONT YOU AND FITCHETT BOAST TOO MUCH THAT IS ALL
THE PHAETON WAS DRIVEN ONWARDS WITH THE LAST WORDS LEAVING MRS
FITCHETT LAUGHING AND SHAKING HER HEAD SLOWLY WITH AN INTERJECTIONALSURELY SURELY
FROM WHICH IT MIGHT BE INFERRED THAT SHE WOULDHAVE FOUND THE COUNTRYSIDE SOMEWHAT DULLER IF THE RECTORS LADY HADBEEN LESS FREESPOKEN AND LESS OF A SKINFLINT
 INDEED BOTH THE FARMERSAND LABORERS IN THE PARISHES OF FRESHITT AND TIPTON WOULD HAVE FELT ASAD LACK OF CONVERSATION BUT FOR THE STORIES ABOUT WHAT MRS
CADWALLADER SAID AND DID A LADY OF IMMEASURABLY HIGH BIRTH DESCENDEDAS IT WERE FROM UNKNOWN EARLS DIM AS THE CROWD OF HEROIC SHADESWHOPLEADED POVERTY PARED DOWN PRICES AND CUT JOKES IN THE MOSTCOMPANIONABLE MANNER THOUGH WITH A TURN OF TONGUE THAT LET YOU KNOWWHO SHE WAS
 SUCH A LADY GAVE A NEIGHBORLINESS TO BOTH RANK ANDRELIGION AND MITIGATED THE BITTERNESS OF UNCOMMUTED TITHE
 A MUCH MOREEXEMPLARY CHARACTER WITH AN INFUSION OF SOUR DIGNITY WOULD NOT HAVEFURTHERED THEIR COMPREHENSION OF THE THIRTYNINE ARTICLES AND WOULDHAVE BEEN LESS SOCIALLY UNITING
MR
 BROOKE SEEING MRS
 CADWALLADERS MERITS FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OFVIEW WINCED A LITTLE WHEN HER NAME WAS ANNOUNCED IN THE LIBRARY WHEREHE WAS SITTING ALONE

MR
 BROOKE AGAIN WINCED INWARDLY FOR DOROTHEAS ENGAGEMENT HAD NOSOONER BEEN DECIDED THAN HE HAD THOUGHT OF MRS
 CADWALLADERSPROSPECTIVE TAUNTS
 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EASY FOR IGNORANT OBSERVERS TOSAY QUARREL WITH MRS
 CADWALLADER BUT WHERE IS A COUNTRY GENTLEMANTO GO WHO QUARRELS WITH HIS OLDEST NEIGHBORS
 WHO COULD TASTE THE FINEFLAVOR IN THE NAME OF BROOKE IF IT WERE DELIVERED CASUALLY LIKE WINEWITHOUT A SEAL
 CERTAINLY A MAN CAN ONLY BE COSMOPOLITAN UP TO ACERTAIN POINT
I HOPE CHETTAM AND I SHALL ALWAYS BE GOOD FRIENDS BUT I AM SORRY TOSAY THERE IS NO PROSPECT OF HIS MARRYING MY NIECE SAID MR
 BROOKEMUCH RELIEVED TO SEE THROUGH THE WINDOW THAT CELIA WAS COMING IN
WHY NOT
 SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER WITH A SHARP NOTE OF SURPRISE
 IT ISHARDLY A FORTNIGHT SINCE YOU AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT IT
MY NIECE HAS CHOSEN ANOTHER SUITORHAS CHOSEN HIM YOU KNOW
 I HAVEHAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
 I SHOULD HAVE PREFERRED CHETTAM AND ISHOULD HAVE SAID CHETTAM WAS THE MAN ANY GIRL WOULD HAVE CHOSEN
 BUTTHERE IS NO ACCOUNTING FOR THESE THINGS
 YOUR SEX IS CAPRICIOUS YOUKNOW
WHY WHOM DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU ARE GOING TO LET HER MARRY
MRS
 CADWALLADERS MIND WAS RAPIDLY SURVEYING THE POSSIBILITIES OFCHOICE FOR DOROTHEA
BUT HERE CELIA ENTERED BLOOMING FROM A WALK IN THE GARDEN AND THEGREETING WITH HER DELIVERED MR
 BROOKE FROM THE NECESSITY OF ANSWERINGIMMEDIATELY
 HE GOT UP HASTILY AND SAYING BY THE WAY I MUST SPEAKTO WRIGHT ABOUT THE HORSES SHUFFLED QUICKLY OUT OF THE ROOM
MY DEAR CHILD WHAT IS THIS
THIS ABOUT YOUR SISTERS ENGAGEMENT
SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER
SHE IS ENGAGED TO MARRY MR
 CASAUBON SAID CELIA RESORTING ASUSUAL TO THE SIMPLEST STATEMENT OF FACT AND ENJOYING THIS OPPORTUNITYOF SPEAKING TO THE RECTORS WIFE ALONE
THIS IS FRIGHTFUL
 HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN GOING ON
I ONLY KNEW OF IT YESTERDAY
 THEY ARE TO BE MARRIED IN SIX WEEKS
WELL MY DEAR I WISH YOU JOY OF YOUR BROTHERINLAW
I AM SO SORRY FOR DOROTHEA
SORRY
 IT IS HER DOING I SUPPOSE
YES SHE SAYS MR
 CASAUBON HAS A GREAT SOUL
WITH ALL MY HEART
OH MRS
 CADWALLADER I DONT THINK IT CAN BE NICE TO MARRY A MAN WITHA GREAT SOUL
WELL MY DEAR TAKE WARNING
 YOU KNOW THE LOOK OF ONE NOW WHEN THENEXT COMES AND WANTS TO MARRY YOU DONT YOU ACCEPT HIM
IM SURE I NEVER SHOULD
NO ONE SUCH IN A FAMILY IS ENOUGH
 SO YOUR SISTER NEVER CARED ABOUTSIR JAMES CHETTAM
 WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE SAID TO HIM FOR ABROTHERINLAW
I SHOULD HAVE LIKED THAT VERY MUCH
 I AM SURE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AGOOD HUSBAND
 ONLY CELIA ADDED WITH A SLIGHT BLUSH SHE SOMETIMESSEEMED TO BLUSH AS SHE BREATHED I DONT THINK HE WOULD HAVE SUITEDDOROTHEA
NOT HIGHFLOWN ENOUGH
DODO IS VERY STRICT
 SHE THINKS SO MUCH ABOUT EVERYTHING AND IS SOPARTICULAR ABOUT WHAT ONE SAYS
 SIR JAMES NEVER SEEMED TO PLEASE HER
SHE MUST HAVE ENCOURAGED HIM I AM SURE
 THAT IS NOT VERY CREDITABLE
PLEASE DONT BE ANGRY WITH DODO SHE DOES NOT SEE THINGS
 SHE THOUGHTSO MUCH ABOUT THE COTTAGES AND SHE WAS RUDE TO SIR JAMES SOMETIMESBUT HE IS SO KIND HE NEVER NOTICED IT
WELL SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER PUTTING ON HER SHAWL AND RISING AS IFIN HASTE I MUST GO STRAIGHT TO SIR JAMES AND BREAK THIS TO HIM
 HEWILL HAVE BROUGHT HIS MOTHER BACK BY THIS TIME AND I MUST CALL
 YOURUNCLE WILL NEVER TELL HIM
 WE ARE ALL DISAPPOINTED MY DEAR
 YOUNGPEOPLE SHOULD THINK OF THEIR FAMILIES IN MARRYING
 I SET A BADEXAMPLEMARRIED A POOR CLERGYMAN AND MADE MYSELF A PITIABLE OBJECTAMONG THE DE BRACYSOBLIGED TO GET MY COALS BY STRATAGEM AND PRAY TOHEAVEN FOR MY SALAD OIL
 HOWEVER CASAUBON HAS MONEY ENOUGH I MUST DOHIM THAT JUSTICE
 AS TO HIS BLOOD I SUPPOSE THE FAMILY QUARTERINGS ARETHREE CUTTLEFISH SABLE AND A COMMENTATOR RAMPANT
 BY THE BYE BEFOREI GO MY DEAR I MUST SPEAK TO YOUR MRS
 CARTER ABOUT PASTRY
 I WANT TOSEND MY YOUNG COOK TO LEARN OF HER
 POOR PEOPLE WITH FOUR CHILDRENLIKE US YOU KNOW CANT AFFORD TO KEEP A GOOD COOK
 I HAVE NO DOUBTMRS
 CARTER WILL OBLIGE ME
 SIR JAMESS COOK IS A PERFECT DRAGON
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR MRS
 CADWALLADER HAD CIRCUMVENTED MRS
 CARTER ANDDRIVEN TO FRESHITT HALL WHICH WAS NOT FAR FROM HER OWN PARSONAGE HERHUSBAND BEING RESIDENT IN FRESHITT AND KEEPING A CURATE IN TIPTON
SIR JAMES CHETTAM HAD RETURNED FROM THE SHORT JOURNEY WHICH HAD KEPTHIM ABSENT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND HAD CHANGED HIS DRESS INTENDINGTO RIDE OVER TO TIPTON GRANGE
 HIS HORSE WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR WHENMRS
 CADWALLADER DROVE UP AND HE IMMEDIATELY APPEARED THERE HIMSELFWHIP IN HAND
 LADY CHETTAM HAD NOT YET RETURNED BUT MRS
 CADWALLADERSERRAND COULD NOT BE DESPATCHED IN THE PRESENCE OF GROOMS SO SHE ASKEDTO BE TAKEN INTO THE CONSERVATORY CLOSE BY TO LOOK AT THE NEW PLANTSAND ON COMING TO A CONTEMPLATIVE STAND SHE SAIDI HAVE A GREAT SHOCK FOR YOU I HOPE YOU ARE NOT SO FAR GONE IN LOVEAS YOU PRETENDED TO BE
IT WAS OF NO USE PROTESTING AGAINST MRS
 CADWALLADERS WAY OF PUTTINGTHINGS
 BUT SIR JAMESS COUNTENANCE CHANGED A LITTLE
 HE FELT A VAGUEALARM
I DO BELIEVE BROOKE IS GOING TO EXPOSE HIMSELF AFTER ALL
 I ACCUSEDHIM OF MEANING TO STAND FOR MIDDLEMARCH ON THE LIBERAL SIDE AND HELOOKED SILLY AND NEVER DENIED ITTALKED ABOUT THE INDEPENDENT LINE ANDTHE USUAL NONSENSE
IS THAT ALL
 SAID SIR JAMES MUCH RELIEVED
WHY REJOINED MRS
 CADWALLADER WITH A SHARPER NOTE YOU DONT MEANTO SAY THAT YOU WOULD LIKE HIM TO TURN PUBLIC MAN IN THAT WAYMAKING ASORT OF POLITICAL CHEAP JACK OF HIMSELF
HE MIGHT BE DISSUADED I SHOULD THINK
 HE WOULD NOT LIKE THE EXPENSE
THAT IS WHAT I TOLD HIM
 HE IS VULNERABLE TO REASON THEREALWAYS A FEWGRAINS OF COMMONSENSE IN AN OUNCE OF MISERLINESS
 MISERLINESS IS ACAPITAL QUALITY TO RUN IN FAMILIES ITS THE SAFE SIDE FOR MADNESS TODIP ON
 AND THERE MUST BE A LITTLE CRACK IN THE BROOKE FAMILY ELSE WESHOULD NOT SEE WHAT WE ARE TO SEE
WHAT
 BROOKE STANDING FOR MIDDLEMARCH
WORSE THAN THAT
 I REALLY FEEL A LITTLE RESPONSIBLE
 I ALWAYS TOLD YOUMISS BROOKE WOULD BE SUCH A FINE MATCH
 I KNEW THERE WAS A GREAT DEALOF NONSENSE IN HERA FLIGHTY SORT OF METHODISTICAL STUFF
 BUT THESETHINGS WEAR OUT OF GIRLS
 HOWEVER I AM TAKEN BY SURPRISE FOR ONCE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN MRS
 CADWALLADER
 SAID SIR JAMES
 HIS FEAR LESTMISS BROOKE SHOULD HAVE RUN AWAY TO JOIN THE MORAVIAN BRETHREN OR SOMEPREPOSTEROUS SECT UNKNOWN TO GOOD SOCIETY WAS A LITTLE ALLAYED BY THEKNOWLEDGE THAT MRS
 CADWALLADER ALWAYS MADE THE WORST OF THINGS
 WHATHAS HAPPENED TO MISS BROOKE
 PRAY SPEAK OUT
VERY WELL
 SHE IS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED
 MRS
 CADWALLADER PAUSED AFEW MOMENTS OBSERVING THE DEEPLY HURT EXPRESSION IN HER FRIENDS FACEWHICH HE WAS TRYING TO CONCEAL BY A NERVOUS SMILE WHILE HE WHIPPED HISBOOT BUT SHE SOON ADDED ENGAGED TO CASAUBON
SIR JAMES LET HIS WHIP FALL AND STOOPED TO PICK IT UP
 PERHAPS HIS FACEHAD NEVER BEFORE GATHERED SO MUCH CONCENTRATED DISGUST AS WHEN HETURNED TO MRS
 CADWALLADER AND REPEATED CASAUBON
EVEN SO
 YOU KNOW MY ERRAND NOW
GOOD GOD
 IT IS HORRIBLE
 HE IS NO BETTER THAN A MUMMY
 THE POINT OFVIEW HAS TO BE ALLOWED FOR AS THAT OF A BLOOMING AND DISAPPOINTEDRIVAL
SHE SAYS HE IS A GREAT SOUL
A GREAT BLADDER FOR DRIED PEAS TO RATTLEIN
 SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER
WHAT BUSINESS HAS AN OLD BACHELOR LIKE THAT TO MARRY
 SAID SIR JAMES
HE HAS ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE
HE MEANS TO DRAW IT OUT AGAIN I SUPPOSE
BROOKE OUGHT NOT TO ALLOW IT HE SHOULD INSIST ON ITS BEING PUT OFFTILL SHE IS OF AGE
 SHE WOULD THINK BETTER OF IT THEN
 WHAT IS AGUARDIAN FOR
AS IF YOU COULD EVER SQUEEZE A RESOLUTION OUT OF BROOKE
CADWALLADER MIGHT TALK TO HIM
NOT HE
 HUMPHREY FINDS EVERYBODY CHARMING
 I NEVER CAN GET HIM TOABUSE CASAUBON
 HE WILL EVEN SPEAK WELL OF THE BISHOP THOUGH I TELLHIM IT IS UNNATURAL IN A BENEFICED CLERGYMAN WHAT CAN ONE DO WITH AHUSBAND WHO ATTENDS SO LITTLE TO THE DECENCIES
 I HIDE IT AS WELL AS ICAN BY ABUSING EVERYBODY MYSELF
 COME COME CHEER UP
 YOU ARE WELL RIDOF MISS BROOKE A GIRL WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRING YOU TO SEE THESTARS BY DAYLIGHT
 BETWEEN OURSELVES LITTLE CELIA IS WORTH TWO OF HERAND LIKELY AFTER ALL TO BE THE BETTER MATCH
 FOR THIS MARRIAGE TOCASAUBON IS AS GOOD AS GOING TO A NUNNERY
OH ON MY OWN ACCOUNTIT IS FOR MISS BROOKES SAKE I THINK HER FRIENDSSHOULD TRY TO USE THEIR INFLUENCE
WELL HUMPHREY DOESNT KNOW YET
 BUT WHEN I TELL HIM YOU MAY DEPENDON IT HE WILL SAY WHY NOT
 CASAUBON IS A GOOD FELLOWAND YOUNGYOUNGENOUGH
 THESE CHARITABLE PEOPLE NEVER KNOW VINEGAR FROM WINE TILL THEYHAVE SWALLOWED IT AND GOT THE COLIC
 HOWEVER IF I WERE A MAN I SHOULDPREFER CELIA ESPECIALLY WHEN DOROTHEA WAS GONE
 THE TRUTH IS YOU HAVEBEEN COURTING ONE AND HAVE WON THE OTHER
 I CAN SEE THAT SHE ADMIRESYOU ALMOST AS MUCH AS A MAN EXPECTS TO BE ADMIRED
 IF IT WERE ANY ONEBUT ME WHO SAID SO YOU MIGHT THINK IT EXAGGERATION
 GOODBY
SIR JAMES HANDED MRS
 CADWALLADER TO THE PHAETON AND THEN JUMPED ONHIS HORSE
 HE WAS NOT GOING TO RENOUNCE HIS RIDE BECAUSE OF HISFRIENDS UNPLEASANT NEWSONLY TO RIDE THE FASTER IN SOME OTHERDIRECTION THAN THAT OF TIPTON GRANGE
NOW WHY ON EARTH SHOULD MRS
 CADWALLADER HAVE BEEN AT ALL BUSY ABOUTMISS BROOKES MARRIAGE AND WHY WHEN ONE MATCH THAT SHE LIKED TO THINKSHE HAD A HAND IN WAS FRUSTRATED SHOULD SHE HAVE STRAIGHTWAY CONTRIVEDTHE PRELIMINARIES OF ANOTHER
 WAS THERE ANY INGENIOUS PLOT ANYHIDEANDSEEK COURSE OF ACTION WHICH MIGHT BE DETECTED BY A CAREFULTELESCOPIC WATCH
 NOT AT ALL A TELESCOPE MIGHT HAVE SWEPT THE PARISHESOF TIPTON AND FRESHITT THE WHOLE AREA VISITED BY MRS
 CADWALLADER INHER PHAETON WITHOUT WITNESSING ANY INTERVIEW THAT COULD EXCITESUSPICION OR ANY SCENE FROM WHICH SHE DID NOT RETURN WITH THE SAMEUNPERTURBED KEENNESS OF EYE AND THE SAME HIGH NATURAL COLOR
 IN FACTIF THAT CONVENIENT VEHICLE HAD EXISTED IN THE DAYS OF THE SEVEN SAGESONE OF THEM WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE REMARKED THAT YOU CAN KNOW LITTLE OFWOMEN BY FOLLOWING THEM ABOUT IN THEIR PONYPHAETONS
 EVEN WITH AMICROSCOPE DIRECTED ON A WATERDROP WE FIND OURSELVES MAKINGINTERPRETATIONS WHICH TURN OUT TO BE RATHER COARSE FOR WHEREAS UNDER AWEAK LENS YOU MAY SEEM TO SEE A CREATURE EXHIBITING AN ACTIVE VORACITYINTO WHICH OTHER SMALLER CREATURES ACTIVELY PLAY AS IF THEY WERE SOMANY ANIMATED TAXPENNIES A STRONGER LENS REVEALS TO YOU CERTAINTINIEST HAIRLETS WHICH MAKE VORTICES FOR THESE VICTIMS WHILE THESWALLOWER WAITS PASSIVELY AT HIS RECEIPT OF CUSTOM
 IN THIS WAYMETAPHORICALLY SPEAKING A STRONG LENS APPLIED TO MRS
 CADWALLADERSMATCHMAKING WILL SHOW A PLAY OF MINUTE CAUSES PRODUCING WHAT MAY BECALLED THOUGHT AND SPEECH VORTICES TO BRING HER THE SORT OF FOOD SHENEEDED
 HER LIFE WAS RURALLY SIMPLE QUITE FREE FROM SECRETS EITHERFOUL DANGEROUS OR OTHERWISE IMPORTANT AND NOT CONSCIOUSLY AFFECTEDBY THE GREAT AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD
 ALL THE MORE DID THE AFFAIRS OF THEGREAT WORLD INTEREST HER WHEN COMMUNICATED IN THE LETTERS OF HIGHBORNRELATIONS THE WAY IN WHICH FASCINATING YOUNGER SONS HAD GONE TO THEDOGS BY MARRYING THEIR MISTRESSES THE FINE OLDBLOODED IDIOCY OF YOUNGLORD TAPIR AND THE FURIOUS GOUTY HUMORS OF OLD LORD MEGATHERIUM THEEXACT CROSSING OF GENEALOGIES WHICH HAD BROUGHT A CORONET INTO A NEWBRANCH AND WIDENED THE RELATIONS OF SCANDALTHESE WERE TOPICS OF WHICHSHE RETAINED DETAILS WITH THE UTMOST ACCURACY AND REPRODUCED THEM INAN EXCELLENT PICKLE OF EPIGRAMS WHICH SHE HERSELF ENJOYED THE MOREBECAUSE SHE BELIEVED AS UNQUESTIONABLY IN BIRTH AND NOBIRTH AS SHE DIDIN GAME AND VERMIN
 SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE DISOWNED ANY ONE ON THE GROUNDOF POVERTY A DE BRACY REDUCED TO TAKE HIS DINNER IN A BASIN WOULD HAVESEEMED TO HER AN EXAMPLE OF PATHOS WORTH EXAGGERATING AND I FEAR HISARISTOCRATIC VICES WOULD NOT HAVE HORRIFIED HER
 BUT HER FEELINGTOWARDS THE VULGAR RICH WAS A SORT OF RELIGIOUS HATRED THEY HADPROBABLY MADE ALL THEIR MONEY OUT OF HIGH RETAIL PRICES AND MRS
CADWALLADER DETESTED HIGH PRICES FOR EVERYTHING THAT WAS NOT PAID INKIND AT THE RECTORY SUCH PEOPLE WERE NO PART OF GODS DESIGN IN MAKINGTHE WORLD AND THEIR ACCENT WAS AN AFFLICTION TO THE EARS
 A TOWN WHERESUCH MONSTERS ABOUNDED WAS HARDLY MORE THAN A SORT OF LOW COMEDY WHICHCOULD NOT BE TAKEN ACCOUNT OF IN A WELLBRED SCHEME OF THE UNIVERSE
LET ANY LADY WHO IS INCLINED TO BE HARD ON MRS
 CADWALLADER INQUIREINTO THE COMPREHENSIVENESS OF HER OWN BEAUTIFUL VIEWS AND BE QUITESURE THAT THEY AFFORD ACCOMMODATION FOR ALL THE LIVES WHICH HAVE THEHONOR TO COEXIST WITH HERS
WITH SUCH A MIND ACTIVE AS PHOSPHORUS BITING EVERYTHING THAT CAMENEAR INTO THE FORM THAT SUITED IT HOW COULD MRS
 CADWALLADER FEEL THATTHE MISS BROOKES AND THEIR MATRIMONIAL PROSPECTS WERE ALIEN TO HER
ESPECIALLY AS IT HAD BEEN THE HABIT OF YEARS FOR HER TO SCOLD MR
BROOKE WITH THE FRIENDLIEST FRANKNESS AND LET HIM KNOW IN CONFIDENCETHAT SHE THOUGHT HIM A POOR CREATURE
 FROM THE FIRST ARRIVAL OF THEYOUNG LADIES IN TIPTON SHE HAD PREARRANGED DOROTHEAS MARRIAGE WITH SIRJAMES AND IF IT HAD TAKEN PLACE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE SURE THAT IT WASHER DOING THAT IT SHOULD NOT TAKE PLACE AFTER SHE HAD PRECONCEIVED ITCAUSED HER AN IRRITATION WHICH EVERY THINKER WILL SYMPATHIZE WITH
 SHEWAS THE DIPLOMATIST OF TIPTON AND FRESHITT AND FOR ANYTHING TO HAPPENIN SPITE OF HER WAS AN OFFENSIVE IRREGULARITY
 AS TO FREAKS LIKE THISOF MISS BROOKES MRS
 CADWALLADER HAD NO PATIENCE WITH THEM AND NOWSAW THAT HER OPINION OF THIS GIRL HAD BEEN INFECTED WITH SOME OF HERHUSBANDS WEAK CHARITABLENESS THOSE METHODISTICAL WHIMS THAT AIR OFBEING MORE RELIGIOUS THAN THE RECTOR AND CURATE TOGETHER CAME FROM ADEEPER AND MORE CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASE THAN SHE HAD BEEN WILLING TOBELIEVE
HOWEVER SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER FIRST TO HERSELF AND AFTERWARDS TOHER HUSBAND I THROW HER OVER THERE WAS A CHANCE IF SHE HAD MARRIEDSIR JAMES OF HER BECOMING A SANE SENSIBLE WOMAN
 HE WOULD NEVER HAVECONTRADICTED HER AND WHEN A WOMAN IS NOT CONTRADICTED SHE HAS NOMOTIVE FOR OBSTINACY IN HER ABSURDITIES
 BUT NOW I WISH HER JOY OF HERHAIR SHIRT
IT FOLLOWED THAT MRS
 CADWALLADER MUST DECIDE ON ANOTHER MATCH FOR SIRJAMES AND HAVING MADE UP HER MIND THAT IT WAS TO BE THE YOUNGER MISSBROOKE THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A MORE SKILFUL MOVE TOWARDS THESUCCESS OF HER PLAN THAN HER HINT TO THE BARONET THAT HE HAD MADE ANIMPRESSION ON CELIAS HEART
 FOR HE WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE GENTLEMEN WHOLANGUISH AFTER THE UNATTAINABLE SAPPHOS APPLE THAT LAUGHS FROM THETOPMOST BOUGHTHE CHARMS WHICHSMILE LIKE THE KNOT OF COWSLIPS ON THE CLIFFNOT TO BE COME AT BY THE WILLING HAND
HE HAD NO SONNETS TO WRITE AND IT COULD NOT STRIKE HIM AGREEABLY THATHE WAS NOT AN OBJECT OF PREFERENCE TO THE WOMAN WHOM HE HAD PREFERRED
ALREADY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT DOROTHEA HAD CHOSEN MR
 CASAUBON HAD BRUISEDHIS ATTACHMENT AND RELAXED ITS HOLD
 ALTHOUGH SIR JAMES WAS ASPORTSMAN HE HAD SOME OTHER FEELINGS TOWARDS WOMEN THAN TOWARDS GROUSEAND FOXES AND DID NOT REGARD HIS FUTURE WIFE IN THE LIGHT OF PREYVALUABLE CHIEFLY FOR THE EXCITEMENTS OF THE CHASE
 NEITHER WAS HE SOWELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE HABITS OF PRIMITIVE RACES AS TO FEEL THAT ANIDEAL COMBAT FOR HER TOMAHAWK IN HAND SO TO SPEAK WAS NECESSARY TOTHE HISTORICAL CONTINUITY OF THE MARRIAGETIE
 ON THE CONTRARY HAVINGTHE AMIABLE VANITY WHICH KNITS US TO THOSE WHO ARE FOND OF US ANDDISINCLINES US TO THOSE WHO ARE INDIFFERENT AND ALSO A GOOD GRATEFULNATURE THE MERE IDEA THAT A WOMAN HAD A KINDNESS TOWARDS HIM SPUNLITTLE THREADS OF TENDERNESS FROM OUT HIS HEART TOWARDS HERS
THUS IT HAPPENED THAT AFTER SIR JAMES HAD RIDDEN RATHER FAST FOR HALFAN HOUR IN A DIRECTION AWAY FROM TIPTON GRANGE HE SLACKENED HIS PACEAND AT LAST TURNED INTO A ROAD WHICH WOULD LEAD HIM BACK BY A SHORTERCUT
 VARIOUS FEELINGS WROUGHT IN HIM THE DETERMINATION AFTER ALL TO GOTO THE GRANGE TODAY AS IF NOTHING NEW HAD HAPPENED
 HE COULD NOT HELPREJOICING THAT HE HAD NEVER MADE THE OFFER AND BEEN REJECTED MEREFRIENDLY POLITENESS REQUIRED THAT HE SHOULD CALL TO SEE DOROTHEA ABOUTTHE COTTAGES AND NOW HAPPILY MRS
 CADWALLADER HAD PREPARED HIM TOOFFER HIS CONGRATULATIONS IF NECESSARY WITHOUT SHOWING TOO MUCHAWKWARDNESS
 HE REALLY DID NOT LIKE IT GIVING UP DOROTHEA WAS VERYPAINFUL TO HIM BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE RESOLVE TO MAKE THISVISIT FORTHWITH AND CONQUER ALL SHOW OF FEELING WHICH WAS A SORT OFFILEBITING AND COUNTERIRRITANT
 AND WITHOUT HIS DISTINCTLYRECOGNIZING THE IMPULSE THERE CERTAINLY WAS PRESENT IN HIM THE SENSETHAT CELIA WOULD BE THERE AND THAT HE SHOULD PAY HER MORE ATTENTIONTHAN HE HAD DONE BEFORE
WE MORTALS MEN AND WOMEN DEVOUR MANY A DISAPPOINTMENT BETWEENBREAKFAST AND DINNERTIME KEEP BACK THE TEARS AND LOOK A LITTLE PALEABOUT THE LIPS AND IN ANSWER TO INQUIRIES SAY OH NOTHING
 PRIDEHELPS US AND PRIDE IS NOT A BAD THING WHEN IT ONLY URGES US TO HIDEOUR OWN HURTSNOT TO HURT OTHERS
CHAPTER VII
PIACER E POPONEVUOL LA SUA STAGIONE
ITALIAN PROVERB
MR
 CASAUBON AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF HIS TIME ATTHE GRANGE IN THESE WEEKS AND THE HINDRANCE WHICH COURTSHIP OCCASIONEDTO THE PROGRESS OF HIS GREAT WORKTHE KEY TO ALL MYTHOLOGIESNATURALLYMADE HIM LOOK FORWARD THE MORE EAGERLY TO THE HAPPY TERMINATION OFCOURTSHIP
 BUT HE HAD DELIBERATELY INCURRED THE HINDRANCE HAVING MADEUP HIS MIND THAT IT WAS NOW TIME FOR HIM TO ADORN HIS LIFE WITH THEGRACES OF FEMALE COMPANIONSHIP TO IRRADIATE THE GLOOM WHICH FATIGUEWAS APT TO HANG OVER THE INTERVALS OF STUDIOUS LABOR WITH THE PLAY OFFEMALE FANCY AND TO SECURE IN THIS HIS CULMINATING AGE THE SOLACE OFFEMALE TENDANCE FOR HIS DECLINING YEARS
 HENCE HE DETERMINED TO ABANDONHIMSELF TO THE STREAM OF FEELING AND PERHAPS WAS SURPRISED TO FINDWHAT AN EXCEEDINGLY SHALLOW RILL IT WAS
 AS IN DROUGHTY REGIONS BAPTISMBY IMMERSION COULD ONLY BE PERFORMED SYMBOLICALLY MR
 CASAUBON FOUNDTHAT SPRINKLING WAS THE UTMOST APPROACH TO A PLUNGE WHICH HIS STREAMWOULD AFFORD HIM AND HE CONCLUDED THAT THE POETS HAD MUCH EXAGGERATEDTHE FORCE OF MASCULINE PASSION
 NEVERTHELESS HE OBSERVED WITH PLEASURETHAT MISS BROOKE SHOWED AN ARDENT SUBMISSIVE AFFECTION WHICH PROMISEDTO FULFIL HIS MOST AGREEABLE PREVISIONS OF MARRIAGE
 IT HAD ONCE ORTWICE CROSSED HIS MIND THAT POSSIBLY THERE WAS SOME DEFICIENCY INDOROTHEA TO ACCOUNT FOR THE MODERATION OF HIS ABANDONMENT BUT HE WASUNABLE TO DISCERN THE DEFICIENCY OR TO FIGURE TO HIMSELF A WOMAN WHOWOULD HAVE PLEASED HIM BETTER SO THAT THERE WAS CLEARLY NO REASON TOFALL BACK UPON BUT THE EXAGGERATIONS OF HUMAN TRADITION
COULD I NOT BE PREPARING MYSELF NOW TO BE MORE USEFUL
 SAID DOROTHEATO HIM ONE MORNING EARLY IN THE TIME OF COURTSHIP COULD I NOT LEARNTO READ LATIN AND GREEK ALOUD TO YOU AS MILTONS DAUGHTERS DID TOTHEIR FATHER WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY READ
I FEAR THAT WOULD BE WEARISOME TO YOU SAID MR
 CASAUBON SMILINGAND INDEED IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY THE YOUNG WOMEN YOU HAVE MENTIONEDREGARDED THAT EXERCISE IN UNKNOWN TONGUES AS A GROUND FOR REBELLIONAGAINST THE POET
YES BUT IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY WERE VERY NAUGHTY GIRLS ELSE THEYWOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD TO MINISTER TO SUCH A FATHER AND IN THE SECONDPLACE THEY MIGHT HAVE STUDIED PRIVATELY AND TAUGHT THEMSELVES TOUNDERSTAND WHAT THEY READ AND THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERESTING
 IHOPE YOU DONT EXPECT ME TO BE NAUGHTY AND STUPID
I EXPECT YOU TO BE ALL THAT AN EXQUISITE YOUNG LADY CAN BE IN EVERYPOSSIBLE RELATION OF LIFE
 CERTAINLY IT MIGHT BE A GREAT ADVANTAGE IFYOU WERE ABLE TO COPY THE GREEK CHARACTER AND TO THAT END IT WERE WELLTO BEGIN WITH A LITTLE READING
DOROTHEA SEIZED THIS AS A PRECIOUS PERMISSION
 SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ASKEDMR
 CASAUBON AT ONCE TO TEACH HER THE LANGUAGES DREADING OF ALL THINGSTO BE TIRESOME INSTEAD OF HELPFUL BUT IT WAS NOT ENTIRELY OUT OFDEVOTION TO HER FUTURE HUSBAND THAT SHE WISHED TO KNOW LATIN AND GREEK
THOSE PROVINCES OF MASCULINE KNOWLEDGE SEEMED TO HER A STANDINGGROUNDFROM WHICH ALL TRUTH COULD BE SEEN MORE TRULY
 AS IT WAS SHECONSTANTLY DOUBTED HER OWN CONCLUSIONS BECAUSE SHE FELT HER OWNIGNORANCE HOW COULD SHE BE CONFIDENT THAT ONEROOMED COTTAGES WERE NOTFOR THE GLORY OF GOD WHEN MEN WHO KNEW THE CLASSICS APPEARED TOCONCILIATE INDIFFERENCE TO THE COTTAGES WITH ZEAL FOR THE GLORY
PERHAPS EVEN HEBREW MIGHT BE NECESSARYAT LEAST THE ALPHABET AND A FEWROOTSIN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT THE CORE OF THINGS AND JUDGE SOUNDLY ONTHE SOCIAL DUTIES OF THE CHRISTIAN
 AND SHE HAD NOT REACHED THAT POINTOF RENUNCIATION AT WHICH SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN SATISFIED WITH HAVING AWISE HUSBAND SHE WISHED POOR CHILD TO BE WISE HERSELF
 MISS BROOKEWAS CERTAINLY VERY NAIVE WITH ALL HER ALLEGED CLEVERNESS
 CELIA WHOSEMIND HAD NEVER BEEN THOUGHT TOO POWERFUL SAW THE EMPTINESS OF OTHERPEOPLES PRETENSIONS MUCH MORE READILY
 TO HAVE IN GENERAL BUT LITTLEFEELING SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY SECURITY AGAINST FEELING TOO MUCH ON ANYPARTICULAR OCCASION
HOWEVER MR
 CASAUBON CONSENTED TO LISTEN AND TEACH FOR AN HOURTOGETHER LIKE A SCHOOLMASTER OF LITTLE BOYS OR RATHER LIKE A LOVERTO WHOM A MISTRESSS ELEMENTARY IGNORANCE AND DIFFICULTIES HAVE ATOUCHING FITNESS
 FEW SCHOLARS WOULD HAVE DISLIKED TEACHING THEALPHABET UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
 BUT DOROTHEA HERSELF WAS A LITTLESHOCKED AND DISCOURAGED AT HER OWN STUPIDITY AND THE ANSWERS SHE GOTTO SOME TIMID QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VALUE OF THE GREEK ACCENTS GAVE HER APAINFUL SUSPICION THAT HERE INDEED THERE MIGHT BE SECRETS NOT CAPABLEOF EXPLANATION TO A WOMANS REASON
MR
 BROOKE HAD NO DOUBT ON THAT POINT AND EXPRESSED HIMSELF WITH HISUSUAL STRENGTH UPON IT ONE DAY THAT HE CAME INTO THE LIBRARY WHILE THEREADING WAS GOING FORWARD
WELL BUT NOW CASAUBON SUCH DEEP STUDIES CLASSICS MATHEMATICSTHAT KIND OF THING ARE TOO TAXING FOR A WOMANTOO TAXING YOU KNOW
DOROTHEA IS LEARNING TO READ THE CHARACTERS SIMPLY SAID MR
CASAUBON EVADING THE QUESTION
 SHE HAD THE VERY CONSIDERATE THOUGHTOF SAVING MY EYES
AH WELL WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING YOU KNOWTHAT MAY NOT BE SO BAD
 BUTTHERE IS A LIGHTNESS ABOUT THE FEMININE MINDA TOUCH AND GOMUSIC THEFINE ARTS THAT KIND OF THINGTHEY SHOULD STUDY THOSE UP TO A CERTAINPOINT WOMEN SHOULD BUT IN A LIGHT WAY YOU KNOW
 A WOMAN SHOULD BEABLE TO SIT DOWN AND PLAY YOU OR SING YOU A GOOD OLD ENGLISH TUNE
 THATIS WHAT I LIKE THOUGH I HAVE HEARD MOST THINGSBEEN AT THE OPERA INVIENNA GLUCK MOZART EVERYTHING OF THAT SORT
 BUT IM A CONSERVATIVEIN MUSICITS NOT LIKE IDEAS YOU KNOW
 I STICK TO THE GOOD OLD TUNES
MR
 CASAUBON IS NOT FOND OF THE PIANO AND I AM VERY GLAD HE IS NOTSAID DOROTHEA WHOSE SLIGHT REGARD FOR DOMESTIC MUSIC AND FEMININE FINEART MUST BE FORGIVEN HER CONSIDERING THE SMALL TINKLING AND SMEARINGIN WHICH THEY CHIEFLY CONSISTED AT THAT DARK PERIOD
 SHE SMILED ANDLOOKED UP AT HER BETROTHED WITH GRATEFUL EYES
 IF HE HAD ALWAYS BEENASKING HER TO PLAY THE LAST ROSE OF SUMMER SHE WOULD HAVE REQUIREDMUCH RESIGNATION
 HE SAYS THERE IS ONLY AN OLD HARPSICHORD AT LOWICKAND IT IS COVERED WITH BOOKS
AH THERE YOU ARE BEHIND CELIA MY DEAR
 CELIA NOW PLAYS VERYPRETTILY AND IS ALWAYS READY TO PLAY
 HOWEVER SINCE CASAUBON DOES NOTLIKE IT YOU ARE ALL RIGHT
 BUT ITS A PITY YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE LITTLERECREATIONS OF THAT SORT CASAUBON THE BOW ALWAYS STRUNGTHAT KIND OFTHING YOU KNOWWILL NOT DO
I NEVER COULD LOOK ON IT IN THE LIGHT OF A RECREATION TO HAVE MY EARSTEASED WITH MEASURED NOISES SAID MR
 CASAUBON
 A TUNE MUCH ITERATEDHAS THE RIDICULOUS EFFECT OF MAKING THE WORDS IN MY MIND PERFORM A SORTOF MINUET TO KEEP TIMEAN EFFECT HARDLY TOLERABLE I IMAGINE AFTERBOYHOOD
 AS TO THE GRANDER FORMS OF MUSIC WORTHY TO ACCOMPANY SOLEMNCELEBRATIONS AND EVEN TO SERVE AS AN EDUCATING INFLUENCE ACCORDING TOTHE ANCIENT CONCEPTION I SAY NOTHING FOR WITH THESE WE ARE NOTIMMEDIATELY CONCERNED
NO BUT MUSIC OF THAT SORT I SHOULD ENJOY SAID DOROTHEA
 WHEN WEWERE COMING HOME FROM LAUSANNE MY UNCLE TOOK US TO HEAR THE GREAT ORGANAT FREIBERG AND IT MADE ME SOB
THAT KIND OF THING IS NOT HEALTHY MY DEAR SAID MR
 BROOKE
CASAUBON SHE WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS NOW YOU MUST TEACH MY NIECE TOTAKE THINGS MORE QUIETLY EH DOROTHEA
HE ENDED WITH A SMILE NOT WISHING TO HURT HIS NIECE BUT REALLYTHINKING THAT IT WAS PERHAPS BETTER FOR HER TO BE EARLY MARRIED TO SOSOBER A FELLOW AS CASAUBON SINCE SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF CHETTAM
IT IS WONDERFUL THOUGH HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE SHUFFLED OUT OF THEROOMIT IS WONDERFUL THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE LIKED HIM
 HOWEVER THEMATCH IS GOOD
 I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TRAVELLING OUT OF MY BRIEF TO HAVEHINDERED IT LET MRS
 CADWALLADER SAY WHAT SHE WILL
 HE IS PRETTYCERTAIN TO BE A BISHOP IS CASAUBON
 THAT WAS A VERY SEASONABLEPAMPHLET OF HIS ON THE CATHOLIC QUESTIONA DEANERY AT LEAST
 THEY OWEHIM A DEANERY
AND HERE I MUST VINDICATE A CLAIM TO PHILOSOPHICAL REFLECTIVENESS BYREMARKING THAT MR
 BROOKE ON THIS OCCASION LITTLE THOUGHT OF THERADICAL SPEECH WHICH AT A LATER PERIOD HE WAS LED TO MAKE ON THEINCOMES OF THE BISHOPS
 WHAT ELEGANT HISTORIAN WOULD NEGLECT A STRIKINGOPPORTUNITY FOR POINTING OUT THAT HIS HEROES DID NOT FORESEE THEHISTORY OF THE WORLD OR EVEN THEIR OWN ACTIONS
FOR EXAMPLE THATHENRY OF NAVARRE WHEN A PROTESTANT BABY LITTLE THOUGHT OF BEING ACATHOLIC MONARCH OR THAT ALFRED THE GREAT WHEN HE MEASURED HISLABORIOUS NIGHTS WITH BURNING CANDLES HAD NO IDEA OF FUTURE GENTLEMENMEASURING THEIR IDLE DAYS WITH WATCHES
 HERE IS A MINE OF TRUTH WHICHHOWEVER VIGOROUSLY IT MAY BE WORKED IS LIKELY TO OUTLAST OUR COAL
BUT OF MR
 BROOKE I MAKE A FURTHER REMARK PERHAPS LESS WARRANTED BYPRECEDENTNAMELY THAT IF HE HAD FOREKNOWN HIS SPEECH IT MIGHT NOTHAVE MADE ANY GREAT DIFFERENCE
 TO THINK WITH PLEASURE OF HIS NIECESHUSBAND HAVING A LARGE ECCLESIASTICAL INCOME WAS ONE THINGTO MAKE ALIBERAL SPEECH WAS ANOTHER THING AND IT IS A NARROW MIND WHICH CANNOTLOOK AT A SUBJECT FROM VARIOUS POINTS OF VIEW
CHAPTER VIII
OH RESCUE HER
 I AM HER BROTHER NOWAND YOU HER FATHER
 EVERY GENTLE MAIDSHOULD HAVE A GUARDIAN IN EACH GENTLEMAN
IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SIR JAMES CHETTAM HOW WELL HE CONTINUED TO LIKEGOING TO THE GRANGE AFTER HE HAD ONCE ENCOUNTERED THE DIFFICULTY OFSEEING DOROTHEA FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE LIGHT OF A WOMAN WHO WASENGAGED TO ANOTHER MAN
 OF COURSE THE FORKED LIGHTNING SEEMED TO PASSTHROUGH HIM WHEN HE FIRST APPROACHED HER AND HE REMAINED CONSCIOUSTHROUGHOUT THE INTERVIEW OF HIDING UNEASINESS BUT GOOD AS HE WAS ITMUST BE OWNED THAT HIS UNEASINESS WAS LESS THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IFHE HAD THOUGHT HIS RIVAL A BRILLIANT AND DESIRABLE MATCH
 HE HAD NOSENSE OF BEING ECLIPSED BY MR
 CASAUBON HE WAS ONLY SHOCKED THATDOROTHEA WAS UNDER A MELANCHOLY ILLUSION AND HIS MORTIFICATION LOSTSOME OF ITS BITTERNESS BY BEING MINGLED WITH COMPASSION
NEVERTHELESS WHILE SIR JAMES SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE HAD COMPLETELYRESIGNED HER SINCE WITH THE PERVERSITY OF A DESDEMONA SHE HAD NOTAFFECTED A PROPOSED MATCH THAT WAS CLEARLY SUITABLE AND ACCORDING TONATURE HE COULD NOT YET BE QUITE PASSIVE UNDER THE IDEA OF HERENGAGEMENT TO MR
 CASAUBON
 ON THE DAY WHEN HE FIRST SAW THEM TOGETHERIN THE LIGHT OF HIS PRESENT KNOWLEDGE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD NOTTAKEN THE AFFAIR SERIOUSLY ENOUGH
 BROOKE WAS REALLY CULPABLE HE OUGHTTO HAVE HINDERED IT
 WHO COULD SPEAK TO HIM
 SOMETHING MIGHT BE DONEPERHAPS EVEN NOW AT LEAST TO DEFER THE MARRIAGE
 ON HIS WAY HOME HETURNED INTO THE RECTORY AND ASKED FOR MR
 CADWALLADER
 HAPPILY THERECTOR WAS AT HOME AND HIS VISITOR WAS SHOWN INTO THE STUDY WHERE ALLTHE FISHING TACKLE HUNG
 BUT HE HIMSELF WAS IN A LITTLE ROOM ADJOININGAT WORK WITH HIS TURNING APPARATUS AND HE CALLED TO THE BARONET TOJOIN HIM THERE
 THE TWO WERE BETTER FRIENDS THAN ANY OTHER LANDHOLDERAND CLERGYMAN IN THE COUNTYA SIGNIFICANT FACT WHICH WAS IN AGREEMENTWITH THE AMIABLE EXPRESSION OF THEIR FACES
MR
 CADWALLADER WAS A LARGE MAN WITH FULL LIPS AND A SWEET SMILE VERYPLAIN AND ROUGH IN HIS EXTERIOR BUT WITH THAT SOLID IMPERTURBABLE EASEAND GOODHUMOR WHICH IS INFECTIOUS AND LIKE GREAT GRASSY HILLS IN THESUNSHINE QUIETS EVEN AN IRRITATED EGOISM AND MAKES IT RATHER ASHAMEDOF ITSELF
 WELL HOW ARE YOU
 HE SAID SHOWING A HAND NOT QUITE FITTO BE GRASPED
 SORRY I MISSED YOU BEFORE
 IS THERE ANYTHINGPARTICULAR
 YOU LOOK VEXED
SIR JAMESS BROW HAD A LITTLE CREASE IN IT A LITTLE DEPRESSION OF THEEYEBROW WHICH HE SEEMED PURPOSELY TO EXAGGERATE AS HE ANSWERED
IT IS ONLY THIS CONDUCT OF BROOKES
 I REALLY THINK SOMEBODY SHOULDSPEAK TO HIM
WHAT
 MEANING TO STAND
 SAID MR
 CADWALLADER GOING ON WITH THEARRANGEMENT OF THE REELS WHICH HE HAD JUST BEEN TURNING
 I HARDLYTHINK HE MEANS IT
 BUT WHERES THE HARM IF HE LIKES IT
 ANY ONE WHOOBJECTS TO WHIGGERY SHOULD BE GLAD WHEN THE WHIGS DONT PUT UP THESTRONGEST FELLOW
 THEY WONT OVERTURN THE CONSTITUTION WITH OUR FRIENDBROOKES HEAD FOR A BATTERING RAM
OH I DONT MEAN THAT SAID SIR JAMES WHO AFTER PUTTING DOWN HISHAT AND THROWING HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR HAD BEGUN TO NURSE HIS LEG ANDEXAMINE THE SOLE OF HIS BOOT WITH MUCH BITTERNESS
 I MEAN THISMARRIAGE
 I MEAN HIS LETTING THAT BLOOMING YOUNG GIRL MARRY CASAUBON
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH CASAUBON
 I SEE NO HARM IN HIMIF THE GIRLLIKES HIM
SHE IS TOO YOUNG TO KNOW WHAT SHE LIKES
 HER GUARDIAN OUGHT TOINTERFERE
 HE OUGHT NOT TO ALLOW THE THING TO BE DONE IN THIS HEADLONGMANNER
 I WONDER A MAN LIKE YOU CADWALLADERA MAN WITH DAUGHTERS CANLOOK AT THE AFFAIR WITH INDIFFERENCE AND WITH SUCH A HEART AS YOURS
DO THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT
I AM NOT JOKING I AM AS SERIOUS AS POSSIBLE SAID THE RECTOR WITH APROVOKING LITTLE INWARD LAUGH
 YOU ARE AS BAD AS ELINOR
 SHE HAS BEENWANTING ME TO GO AND LECTURE BROOKE AND I HAVE REMINDED HER THAT HERFRIENDS HAD A VERY POOR OPINION OF THE MATCH SHE MADE WHEN SHE MARRIEDME
BUT LOOK AT CASAUBON SAID SIR JAMES INDIGNANTLY
 HE MUST BE FIFTYAND I DONT BELIEVE HE COULD EVER HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE THAN THE SHADOWOF A MAN
 LOOK AT HIS LEGS
CONFOUND YOU HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOWS
 YOU THINK OF HAVING IT ALL YOUROWN WAY IN THE WORLD
 YOU DONT UNDERSTAND WOMEN
 THEY DONT ADMIRE YOUHALF SO MUCH AS YOU ADMIRE YOURSELVES
 ELINOR USED TO TELL HER SISTERSTHAT SHE MARRIED ME FOR MY UGLINESSIT WAS SO VARIOUS AND AMUSING THATIT HAD QUITE CONQUERED HER PRUDENCE
YOU
 IT WAS EASY ENOUGH FOR A WOMAN TO LOVE YOU
 BUT THIS IS NOQUESTION OF BEAUTY
 I DONT LIKE CASAUBON
 THIS WAS SIR JAMESSSTRONGEST WAY OF IMPLYING THAT HE THOUGHT ILL OF A MANS CHARACTER
WHY
 WHAT DO YOU KNOW AGAINST HIM
 SAID THE RECTOR LAYING DOWN HISREELS AND PUTTING HIS THUMBS INTO HIS ARMHOLES WITH AN AIR OFATTENTION
SIR JAMES PAUSED
 HE DID NOT USUALLY FIND IT EASY TO GIVE HIS REASONSIT SEEMED TO HIM STRANGE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT KNOW THEM WITHOUT BEINGTOLD SINCE HE ONLY FELT WHAT WAS REASONABLE
 AT LAST HE SAIDNOW CADWALLADER HAS HE GOT ANY HEART
WELL YES
 I DONT MEAN OF THE MELTING SORT BUT A SOUND KERNELTHAT YOU MAY BE SURE OF
 HE IS VERY GOOD TO HIS POOR RELATIONSPENSIONS SEVERAL OF THE WOMEN AND IS EDUCATING A YOUNG FELLOW AT AGOOD DEAL OF EXPENSE
 CASAUBON ACTS UP TO HIS SENSE OF JUSTICE
 HISMOTHERS SISTER MADE A BAD MATCHA POLE I THINKLOST HERSELFAT ANYRATE WAS DISOWNED BY HER FAMILY
 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THAT CASAUBONWOULD NOT HAVE HAD SO MUCH MONEY BY HALF
 I BELIEVE HE WENT HIMSELF TOFIND OUT HIS COUSINS AND SEE WHAT HE COULD DO FOR THEM
 EVERY MANWOULD NOT RING SO WELL AS THAT IF YOU TRIED HIS METAL
 YOU WOULDCHETTAM BUT NOT EVERY MAN
I DONT KNOW SAID SIR JAMES COLORING
 I AM NOT SO SURE OF MYSELF
HE PAUSED A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED THAT WAS A RIGHT THING FORCASAUBON TO DO
 BUT A MAN MAY WISH TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT AND YET BE ASORT OF PARCHMENT CODE
 A WOMAN MAY NOT BE HAPPY WITH HIM
 AND I THINKWHEN A GIRL IS SO YOUNG AS MISS BROOKE IS HER FRIENDS OUGHT TOINTERFERE A LITTLE TO HINDER HER FROM DOING ANYTHING FOOLISH
 YOULAUGH BECAUSE YOU FANCY I HAVE SOME FEELING ON MY OWN ACCOUNT
 BUTUPON MY HONOR IT IS NOT THAT
 I SHOULD FEEL JUST THE SAME IF I WEREMISS BROOKES BROTHER OR UNCLE
WELL BUT WHAT SHOULD YOU DO
I SHOULD SAY THAT THE MARRIAGE MUST NOT BE DECIDED ON UNTIL SHE WAS OFAGE
 AND DEPEND UPON IT IN THAT CASE IT WOULD NEVER COME OFF
 I WISHYOU SAW IT AS I DOI WISH YOU WOULD TALK TO BROOKE ABOUT IT
SIR JAMES ROSE AS HE WAS FINISHING HIS SENTENCE FOR HE SAW MRS
CADWALLADER ENTERING FROM THE STUDY
 SHE HELD BY THE HAND HER YOUNGESTGIRL ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLD WHO IMMEDIATELY RAN TO PAPA AND WAS MADECOMFORTABLE ON HIS KNEE
I HEAR WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SAID THE WIFE
 BUT YOU WILL MAKENO IMPRESSION ON HUMPHREY
 AS LONG AS THE FISH RISE TO HIS BAITEVERYBODY IS WHAT HE OUGHT TO BE
 BLESS YOU CASAUBON HAS GOT ATROUTSTREAM AND DOES NOT CARE ABOUT FISHING IN IT HIMSELF COULDTHERE BE A BETTER FELLOW
WELL THERE IS SOMETHING IN THAT SAID THE RECTOR WITH HIS QUIETINWARD LAUGH
 IT IS A VERY GOOD QUALITY IN A MAN TO HAVE ATROUTSTREAM
BUT SERIOUSLY SAID SIR JAMES WHOSE VEXATION HAD NOT YET SPENTITSELF DONT YOU THINK THE RECTOR MIGHT DO SOME GOOD BY SPEAKING
OH I TOLD YOU BEFOREHAND WHAT HE WOULD SAY ANSWERED MRS
CADWALLADER LIFTING UP HER EYEBROWS
 I HAVE DONE WHAT I COULD I WASHMY HANDS OF THE MARRIAGE
IN THE FIRST PLACE SAID THE RECTOR LOOKING RATHER GRAVE IT WOULDBE NONSENSICAL TO EXPECT THAT I COULD CONVINCE BROOKE AND MAKE HIM ACTACCORDINGLY
 BROOKE IS A VERY GOOD FELLOW BUT PULPY HE WILL RUN INTOANY MOULD BUT HE WONT KEEP SHAPE
HE MIGHT KEEP SHAPE LONG ENOUGH TO DEFER THE MARRIAGE SAID SIRJAMES
BUT MY DEAR CHETTAM WHY SHOULD I USE MY INFLUENCE TO CASAUBONSDISADVANTAGE UNLESS I WERE MUCH SURER THAN I AM THAT I SHOULD BEACTING FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF MISS BROOKE
 I KNOW NO HARM OF CASAUBON
 IDONT CARE ABOUT HIS XISUTHRUS AND FEEFOFUM AND THE REST BUT THEN HEDOESNT CARE ABOUT MY FISHINGTACKLE
 AS TO THE LINE HE TOOK ON THECATHOLIC QUESTION THAT WAS UNEXPECTED BUT HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN CIVIL TOME AND I DONT SEE WHY I SHOULD SPOIL HIS SPORT
 FOR ANYTHING I CANTELL MISS BROOKE MAY BE HAPPIER WITH HIM THAN SHE WOULD BE WITH ANYOTHER MAN
HUMPHREY
 I HAVE NO PATIENCE WITH YOU
 YOU KNOW YOU WOULD RATHER DINEUNDER THE HEDGE THAN WITH CASAUBON ALONE
 YOU HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TOEACH OTHER
WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH MISS BROOKES MARRYING HIM
 SHE DOES NOT DOIT FOR MY AMUSEMENT
HE HAS GOT NO GOOD RED BLOOD IN HIS BODY SAID SIR JAMES
NO
 SOMEBODY PUT A DROP UNDER A MAGNIFYINGGLASS AND IT WAS ALLSEMICOLONS AND PARENTHESES SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER
WHY DOES HE NOT BRING OUT HIS BOOK INSTEAD OF MARRYING SAID SIRJAMES WITH A DISGUST WHICH HE HELD WARRANTED BY THE SOUND FEELING OFAN ENGLISH LAYMAN
OH HE DREAMS FOOTNOTES AND THEY RUN AWAY WITH ALL HIS BRAINS
 THEYSAY WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY HE MADE AN ABSTRACT OF HOP O MYTHUMB AND HE HAS BEEN MAKING ABSTRACTS EVER SINCE
 UGH
 AND THAT ISTHE MAN HUMPHREY GOES ON SAYING THAT A WOMAN MAY BE HAPPY WITH
WELL HE IS WHAT MISS BROOKE LIKES SAID THE RECTOR
 I DONT PROFESSTO UNDERSTAND EVERY YOUNG LADYS TASTE
BUT IF SHE WERE YOUR OWN DAUGHTER
 SAID SIR JAMES
THAT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT AFFAIR
 SHE IS NOT MY DAUGHTER AND IDONT FEEL CALLED UPON TO INTERFERE
 CASAUBON IS AS GOOD AS MOST OF US
HE IS A SCHOLARLY CLERGYMAN AND CREDITABLE TO THE CLOTH
 SOME RADICALFELLOW SPEECHIFYING AT MIDDLEMARCH SAID CASAUBON WAS THE LEARNEDSTRAWCHOPPING INCUMBENT AND FREKE WAS THE BRICKANDMORTAR INCUMBENTAND I WAS THE ANGLING INCUMBENT
 AND UPON MY WORD I DONT SEE THAT ONEIS WORSE OR BETTER THAN THE OTHER
 THE RECTOR ENDED WITH HIS SILENTLAUGH
 HE ALWAYS SAW THE JOKE OF ANY SATIRE AGAINST HIMSELF
 HISCONSCIENCE WAS LARGE AND EASY LIKE THE REST OF HIM IT DID ONLY WHATIT COULD DO WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE
CLEARLY THERE WOULD BE NO INTERFERENCE WITH MISS BROOKES MARRIAGETHROUGH MR
 CADWALLADER AND SIR JAMES FELT WITH SOME SADNESS THAT SHEWAS TO HAVE PERFECT LIBERTY OF MISJUDGMENT
 IT WAS A SIGN OF HIS GOODDISPOSITION THAT HE DID NOT SLACKEN AT ALL IN HIS INTENTION OF CARRYINGOUT DOROTHEAS DESIGN OF THE COTTAGES
 DOUBTLESS THIS PERSISTENCE WASTHE BEST COURSE FOR HIS OWN DIGNITY BUT PRIDE ONLY HELPS US TO BEGENEROUS IT NEVER MAKES US SO ANY MORE THAN VANITY MAKES US WITTY
SHE WAS NOW ENOUGH AWARE OF SIR JAMESS POSITION WITH REGARD TO HER TOAPPRECIATE THE RECTITUDE OF HIS PERSEVERANCE IN A LANDLORDS DUTY TOWHICH HE HAD AT FIRST BEEN URGED BY A LOVERS COMPLAISANCE AND HERPLEASURE IN IT WAS GREAT ENOUGH TO COUNT FOR SOMETHING EVEN IN HERPRESENT HAPPINESS
 PERHAPS SHE GAVE TO SIR JAMES CHETTAMS COTTAGES ALLTHE INTEREST SHE COULD SPARE FROM MR
 CASAUBON OR RATHER FROM THESYMPHONY OF HOPEFUL DREAMS ADMIRING TRUST AND PASSIONATE SELFDEVOTION WHICH THAT LEARNED GENTLEMAN HAD SET PLAYING IN HER SOUL
HENCE IT HAPPENED THAT IN THE GOOD BARONETS SUCCEEDING VISITS WHILEHE WAS BEGINNING TO PAY SMALL ATTENTIONS TO CELIA HE FOUND HIMSELFTALKING WITH MORE AND MORE PLEASURE TO DOROTHEA
 SHE WAS PERFECTLYUNCONSTRAINED AND WITHOUT IRRITATION TOWARDS HIM NOW AND HE WASGRADUALLY DISCOVERING THE DELIGHT THERE IS IN FRANK KINDNESS ANDCOMPANIONSHIP BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN WHO HAVE NO PASSION TO HIDE ORCONFESS
CHAPTER IX
ST GENT
 AN ANCIENT LAND IN ANCIENT ORACLES    IS CALLED LAWTHIRSTY ALL THE STRUGGLE THERE    WAS AFTER ORDER AND A PERFECT RULE
    PRAY WHERE LIE SUCH LANDS NOW
 
 
 
D GENT
 WHY WHERE THEY LAY OF OLDIN HUMAN SOULS
MR
 CASAUBONS BEHAVIOR ABOUT SETTLEMENTS WAS HIGHLY SATISFACTORY TOMR
 BROOKE AND THE PRELIMINARIES OF MARRIAGE ROLLED SMOOTHLY ALONGSHORTENING THE WEEKS OF COURTSHIP
 THE BETROTHED BRIDE MUST SEE HERFUTURE HOME AND DICTATE ANY CHANGES THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MADETHERE
 A WOMAN DICTATES BEFORE MARRIAGE IN ORDER THAT SHE MAY HAVE ANAPPETITE FOR SUBMISSION AFTERWARDS
 AND CERTAINLY THE MISTAKES THAT WEMALE AND FEMALE MORTALS MAKE WHEN WE HAVE OUR OWN WAY MIGHT FAIRLYRAISE SOME WONDER THAT WE ARE SO FOND OF IT
ON A GRAY BUT DRY NOVEMBER MORNING DOROTHEA DROVE TO LOWICK IN COMPANYWITH HER UNCLE AND CELIA
 MR
 CASAUBONS HOME WAS THE MANORHOUSE
CLOSE BY VISIBLE FROM SOME PARTS OF THE GARDEN WAS THE LITTLE CHURCHWITH THE OLD PARSONAGE OPPOSITE
 IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER MR
CASAUBON HAD ONLY HELD THE LIVING BUT THE DEATH OF HIS BROTHER HAD PUTHIM IN POSSESSION OF THE MANOR ALSO
 IT HAD A SMALL PARK WITH A FINEOLD OAK HERE AND THERE AND AN AVENUE OF LIMES TOWARDS THE SOUTHWESTFRONT WITH A SUNK FENCE BETWEEN PARK AND PLEASUREGROUND SO THAT FROMTHE DRAWINGROOM WINDOWS THE GLANCE SWEPT UNINTERRUPTEDLY ALONG A SLOPEOF GREENSWARD TILL THE LIMES ENDED IN A LEVEL OF CORN AND PASTURESWHICH OFTEN SEEMED TO MELT INTO A LAKE UNDER THE SETTING SUN
 THIS WASTHE HAPPY SIDE OF THE HOUSE FOR THE SOUTH AND EAST LOOKED RATHERMELANCHOLY EVEN UNDER THE BRIGHTEST MORNING
 THE GROUNDS HERE WERE MORECONFINED THE FLOWERBEDS SHOWED NO VERY CAREFUL TENDANCE AND LARGECLUMPS OF TREES CHIEFLY OF SOMBRE YEWS HAD RISEN HIGH NOT TEN YARDSFROM THE WINDOWS
 THE BUILDING OF GREENISH STONE WAS IN THE OLDENGLISH STYLE NOT UGLY BUT SMALLWINDOWED AND MELANCHOLYLOOKING THESORT OF HOUSE THAT MUST HAVE CHILDREN MANY FLOWERS OPEN WINDOWS ANDLITTLE VISTAS OF BRIGHT THINGS TO MAKE IT SEEM A JOYOUS HOME
 IN THISLATTER END OF AUTUMN WITH A SPARSE REMNANT OF YELLOW LEAVES FALLINGSLOWLY ATHWART THE DARK EVERGREENS IN A STILLNESS WITHOUT SUNSHINE THEHOUSE TOO HAD AN AIR OF AUTUMNAL DECLINE AND MR
 CASAUBON WHEN HEPRESENTED HIMSELF HAD NO BLOOM THAT COULD BE THROWN INTO RELIEF BYTHAT BACKGROUND
OH DEAR
 CELIA SAID TO HERSELF I AM SURE FRESHITT HALL WOULD HAVEBEEN PLEASANTER THAN THIS
 SHE THOUGHT OF THE WHITE FREESTONE THEPILLARED PORTICO AND THE TERRACE FULL OF FLOWERS SIR JAMES SMILINGABOVE THEM LIKE A PRINCE ISSUING FROM HIS ENCHANTMENT IN A ROSEBUSHWITH A HANDKERCHIEF SWIFTLY METAMORPHOSED FROM THE MOST DELICATELYODOROUS PETALSSIR JAMES WHO TALKED SO AGREEABLY ALWAYS ABOUT THINGSWHICH HAD COMMONSENSE IN THEM AND NOT ABOUT LEARNING
 CELIA HAD THOSELIGHT YOUNG FEMININE TASTES WHICH GRAVE AND WEATHERWORN GENTLEMENSOMETIMES PREFER IN A WIFE BUT HAPPILY MR
 CASAUBONS BIAS HAD BEENDIFFERENT FOR HE WOULD HAVE HAD NO CHANCE WITH CELIA
DOROTHEA ON THE CONTRARY FOUND THE HOUSE AND GROUNDS ALL THAT SHECOULD WISH THE DARK BOOKSHELVES IN THE LONG LIBRARY THE CARPETS ANDCURTAINS WITH COLORS SUBDUED BY TIME THE CURIOUS OLD MAPS ANDBIRDSEYE VIEWS ON THE WALLS OF THE CORRIDOR WITH HERE AND THERE ANOLD VASE BELOW HAD NO OPPRESSION FOR HER AND SEEMED MORE CHEERFULTHAN THE CASTS AND PICTURES AT THE GRANGE WHICH HER UNCLE HAD LONG AGOBROUGHT HOME FROM HIS TRAVELSTHEY BEING PROBABLY AMONG THE IDEAS HEHAD TAKEN IN AT ONE TIME
 TO POOR DOROTHEA THESE SEVERE CLASSICALNUDITIES AND SMIRKING RENAISSANCECORREGGIOSITIES WERE PAINFULLYINEXPLICABLE STARING INTO THE MIDST OF HER PURITANIC CONCEPTIONS SHEHAD NEVER BEEN TAUGHT HOW SHE COULD BRING THEM INTO ANY SORT OFRELEVANCE WITH HER LIFE
 BUT THE OWNERS OF LOWICK APPARENTLY HAD NOTBEEN TRAVELLERS AND MR
 CASAUBONS STUDIES OF THE PAST WERE NOTCARRIED ON BY MEANS OF SUCH AIDS
DOROTHEA WALKED ABOUT THE HOUSE WITH DELIGHTFUL EMOTION
 EVERYTHINGSEEMED HALLOWED TO HER THIS WAS TO BE THE HOME OF HER WIFEHOOD ANDSHE LOOKED UP WITH EYES FULL OF CONFIDENCE TO MR
 CASAUBON WHEN HE DREWHER ATTENTION SPECIALLY TO SOME ACTUAL ARRANGEMENT AND ASKED HER IF SHEWOULD LIKE AN ALTERATION
 ALL APPEALS TO HER TASTE SHE MET GRATEFULLYBUT SAW NOTHING TO ALTER
 HIS EFFORTS AT EXACT COURTESY AND FORMALTENDERNESS HAD NO DEFECT FOR HER
 SHE FILLED UP ALL BLANKS WITHUNMANIFESTED PERFECTIONS INTERPRETING HIM AS SHE INTERPRETED THE WORKSOF PROVIDENCE AND ACCOUNTING FOR SEEMING DISCORDS BY HER OWN DEAFNESSTO THE HIGHER HARMONIES
 AND THERE ARE MANY BLANKS LEFT IN THE WEEKS OFCOURTSHIP WHICH A LOVING FAITH FILLS WITH HAPPY ASSURANCE
NOW MY DEAR DOROTHEA I WISH YOU TO FAVOR ME BY POINTING OUT WHICHROOM YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AS YOUR BOUDOIR SAID MR
 CASAUBONSHOWING THAT HIS VIEWS OF THE WOMANLY NATURE WERE SUFFICIENTLY LARGE TOINCLUDE THAT REQUIREMENT
IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU TO THINK OF THAT SAID DOROTHEA BUT I ASSUREYOU I WOULD RATHER HAVE ALL THOSE MATTERS DECIDED FOR ME
 I SHALL BEMUCH HAPPIER TO TAKE EVERYTHING AS IT ISJUST AS YOU HAVE BEEN USED TOHAVE IT OR AS YOU WILL YOURSELF CHOOSE IT TO BE
 I HAVE NO MOTIVE FORWISHING ANYTHING ELSE
OH DODO SAID CELIA WILL YOU NOT HAVE THE BOWWINDOWED ROOMUPSTAIRS
MR
 CASAUBON LED THE WAY THITHER
 THE BOWWINDOW LOOKED DOWN THE AVENUEOF LIMES THE FURNITURE WAS ALL OF A FADED BLUE AND THERE WEREMINIATURES OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WITH POWDERED HAIR HANGING IN AGROUP
 A PIECE OF TAPESTRY OVER A DOOR ALSO SHOWED A BLUEGREEN WORLDWITH A PALE STAG IN IT
 THE CHAIRS AND TABLES WERE THINLEGGED AND EASYTO UPSET
 IT WAS A ROOM WHERE ONE MIGHT FANCY THE GHOST OF ATIGHTLACED LADY REVISITING THE SCENE OF HER EMBROIDERY
 A LIGHTBOOKCASE CONTAINED DUODECIMO VOLUMES OF POLITE LITERATURE IN CALFCOMPLETING THE FURNITURE
YES SAID MR
 BROOKE THIS WOULD BE A PRETTY ROOM WITH SOME NEWHANGINGS SOFAS AND THAT SORT OF THING
 A LITTLE BARE NOW
NO UNCLE SAID DOROTHEA EAGERLY
 PRAY DO NOT SPEAK OF ALTERINGANYTHING
 THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER THINGS IN THE WORLD THAT WANTALTERINGI LIKE TO TAKE THESE THINGS AS THEY ARE
 AND YOU LIKE THEM ASTHEY ARE DONT YOU
 SHE ADDED LOOKING AT MR
 CASAUBON
 PERHAPS THISWAS YOUR MOTHERS ROOM WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG
IT WAS HE SAID WITH HIS SLOW BEND OF THE HEAD
THIS IS YOUR MOTHER SAID DOROTHEA WHO HAD TURNED TO EXAMINE THEGROUP OF MINIATURES
 IT IS LIKE THE TINY ONE YOU BROUGHT ME ONLY ISHOULD THINK A BETTER PORTRAIT
 AND THIS ONE OPPOSITE WHO IS THIS
HER ELDER SISTER
 THEY WERE LIKE YOU AND YOUR SISTER THE ONLY TWOCHILDREN OF THEIR PARENTS WHO HANG ABOVE THEM YOU SEE
THE SISTER IS PRETTY SAID CELIA IMPLYING THAT SHE THOUGHT LESSFAVORABLY OF MR
 CASAUBONS MOTHER
 IT WAS A NEW OPENING TO CELIASIMAGINATION THAT HE CAME OF A FAMILY WHO HAD ALL BEEN YOUNG IN THEIRTIMETHE LADIES WEARING NECKLACES
IT IS A PECULIAR FACE SAID DOROTHEA LOOKING CLOSELY
 THOSE DEEPGRAY EYES RATHER NEAR TOGETHERAND THE DELICATE IRREGULAR NOSE WITH ASORT OF RIPPLE IN ITAND ALL THE POWDERED CURLS HANGING BACKWARD
ALTOGETHER IT SEEMS TO ME PECULIAR RATHER THAN PRETTY
 THERE IS NOTEVEN A FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND YOUR MOTHER
NO
 AND THEY WERE NOT ALIKE IN THEIR LOT
YOU DID NOT MENTION HER TO ME SAID DOROTHEA
MY AUNT MADE AN UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE
 I NEVER SAW HER
DOROTHEA WONDERED A LITTLE BUT FELT THAT IT WOULD BE INDELICATE JUSTTHEN TO ASK FOR ANY INFORMATION WHICH MR
 CASAUBON DID NOT PROFFER ANDSHE TURNED TO THE WINDOW TO ADMIRE THE VIEW
 THE SUN HAD LATELY PIERCEDTHE GRAY AND THE AVENUE OF LIMES CAST SHADOWS
SHALL WE NOT WALK IN THE GARDEN NOW
 SAID DOROTHEA
AND YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CHURCH YOU KNOW SAID MR
 BROOKE
 ITIS A DROLL LITTLE CHURCH
 AND THE VILLAGE
 IT ALL LIES IN A NUTSHELL
BY THE WAY IT WILL SUIT YOU DOROTHEA FOR THE COTTAGES ARE LIKE A ROWOF ALMSHOUSESLITTLE GARDENS GILLYFLOWERS THAT SORT OF THING
YES PLEASE SAID DOROTHEA LOOKING AT MR
 CASAUBON I SHOULD LIKETO SEE ALL THAT
 SHE HAD GOT NOTHING FROM HIM MORE GRAPHIC ABOUT THELOWICK COTTAGES THAN THAT THEY WERE NOT BAD
THEY WERE SOON ON A GRAVEL WALK WHICH LED CHIEFLY BETWEEN GRASSYBORDERS AND CLUMPS OF TREES THIS BEING THE NEAREST WAY TO THE CHURCHMR
 CASAUBON SAID
 AT THE LITTLE GATE LEADING INTO THE CHURCHYARD THEREWAS A PAUSE WHILE MR
 CASAUBON WENT TO THE PARSONAGE CLOSE BY TO FETCHA KEY
 CELIA WHO HAD BEEN HANGING A LITTLE IN THE REAR CAME UPPRESENTLY WHEN SHE SAW THAT MR
 CASAUBON WAS GONE AWAY AND SAID INHER EASY STACCATO WHICH ALWAYS SEEMED TO CONTRADICT THE SUSPICION OFANY MALICIOUS INTENTDO YOU KNOW DOROTHEA I SAW SOME ONE QUITE YOUNG COMING UP ONE OF THEWALKS
IS THAT ASTONISHING CELIA
THERE MAY BE A YOUNG GARDENER YOU KNOWWHY NOT
 SAID MR
 BROOKE
 ITOLD CASAUBON HE SHOULD CHANGE HIS GARDENER
NO NOT A GARDENER SAID CELIA A GENTLEMAN WITH A SKETCHBOOK
 HEHAD LIGHTBROWN CURLS
 I ONLY SAW HIS BACK
 BUT HE WAS QUITE YOUNG
THE CURATES SON PERHAPS SAID MR
 BROOKE
 AH THERE IS CASAUBONAGAIN AND TUCKER WITH HIM
 HE IS GOING TO INTRODUCE TUCKER
 YOU DONTKNOW TUCKER YET
MR
 TUCKER WAS THE MIDDLEAGED CURATE ONE OF THE INFERIOR CLERGYWHO ARE USUALLY NOT WANTING IN SONS
 BUT AFTER THE INTRODUCTION THECONVERSATION DID NOT LEAD TO ANY QUESTION ABOUT HIS FAMILY AND THESTARTLING APPARITION OF YOUTHFULNESS WAS FORGOTTEN BY EVERY ONE BUTCELIA
 SHE INWARDLY DECLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE LIGHTBROWN CURLS ANDSLIM FIGURE COULD HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIP TO MR
 TUCKER WHO WAS JUST ASOLD AND MUSTYLOOKING AS SHE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED MR
 CASAUBONS CURATETO BE DOUBTLESS AN EXCELLENT MAN WHO WOULD GO TO HEAVEN FOR CELIAWISHED NOT TO BE UNPRINCIPLED BUT THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH WERE SOUNPLEASANT
 CELIA THOUGHT WITH SOME DISMALNESS OF THE TIME SHE SHOULDHAVE TO SPEND AS BRIDESMAID AT LOWICK WHILE THE CURATE HAD PROBABLY NOPRETTY LITTLE CHILDREN WHOM SHE COULD LIKE IRRESPECTIVE OF PRINCIPLE
MR
 TUCKER WAS INVALUABLE IN THEIR WALK AND PERHAPS MR
 CASAUBON HADNOT BEEN WITHOUT FORESIGHT ON THIS HEAD THE CURATE BEING ABLE TOANSWER ALL DOROTHEAS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VILLAGERS AND THE OTHERPARISHIONERS
 EVERYBODY HE ASSURED HER WAS WELL OFF IN LOWICK NOT ACOTTAGER IN THOSE DOUBLE COTTAGES AT A LOW RENT BUT KEPT A PIG AND THESTRIPS OF GARDEN AT THE BACK WERE WELL TENDED
 THE SMALL BOYS WOREEXCELLENT CORDUROY THE GIRLS WENT OUT AS TIDY SERVANTS OR DID ALITTLE STRAWPLAITING AT HOME NO LOOMS HERE NO DISSENT AND THOUGHTHE PUBLIC DISPOSITION WAS RATHER TOWARDS LAYING BY MONEY THAN TOWARDSSPIRITUALITY THERE WAS NOT MUCH VICE
 THE SPECKLED FOWLS WERE SONUMEROUS THAT MR
 BROOKE OBSERVED YOUR FARMERS LEAVE SOME BARLEY FORTHE WOMEN TO GLEAN I SEE
 THE POOR FOLKS HERE MIGHT HAVE A FOWL INTHEIR POT AS THE GOOD FRENCH KING USED TO WISH FOR ALL HIS PEOPLE
 THEFRENCH EAT A GOOD MANY FOWLSSKINNY FOWLS YOU KNOW
I THINK IT WAS A VERY CHEAP WISH OF HIS SAID DOROTHEA INDIGNANTLY
ARE KINGS SUCH MONSTERS THAT A WISH LIKE THAT MUST BE RECKONED A ROYALVIRTUE
AND IF HE WISHED THEM A SKINNY FOWL SAID CELIA THAT WOULD NOT BENICE
 BUT PERHAPS HE WISHED THEM TO HAVE FAT FOWLS
YES BUT THE WORD HAS DROPPED OUT OF THE TEXT OR PERHAPS WASSUBAUDITUM THAT IS PRESENT IN THE KINGS MIND BUT NOT UTTERED SAIDMR
 CASAUBON SMILING AND BENDING HIS HEAD TOWARDS CELIA WHOIMMEDIATELY DROPPED BACKWARD A LITTLE BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT BEAR MR
CASAUBON TO BLINK AT HER
DOROTHEA SANK INTO SILENCE ON THE WAY BACK TO THE HOUSE
 SHE FELT SOMEDISAPPOINTMENT OF WHICH SHE WAS YET ASHAMED THAT THERE WAS NOTHINGFOR HER TO DO IN LOWICK AND IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES HER MIND HADGLANCED OVER THE POSSIBILITY WHICH SHE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED OFFINDING THAT HER HOME WOULD BE IN A PARISH WHICH HAD A LARGER SHARE OFTHE WORLDS MISERY SO THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD MORE ACTIVE DUTIES INIT
 THEN RECURRING TO THE FUTURE ACTUALLY BEFORE HER SHE MADE APICTURE OF MORE COMPLETE DEVOTION TO MR
 CASAUBONS AIMS IN WHICH SHEWOULD AWAIT NEW DUTIES
 MANY SUCH MIGHT REVEAL THEMSELVES TO THE HIGHERKNOWLEDGE GAINED BY HER IN THAT COMPANIONSHIP
MR
 TUCKER SOON LEFT THEM HAVING SOME CLERICAL WORK WHICH WOULD NOTALLOW HIM TO LUNCH AT THE HALL AND AS THEY WERE REENTERING THE GARDENTHROUGH THE LITTLE GATE MR
 CASAUBON SAIDYOU SEEM A LITTLE SAD DOROTHEA
 I TRUST YOU ARE PLEASED WITH WHAT YOUHAVE SEEN
I AM FEELING SOMETHING WHICH IS PERHAPS FOOLISH AND WRONG ANSWEREDDOROTHEA WITH HER USUAL OPENNESSALMOST WISHING THAT THE PEOPLEWANTED MORE TO BE DONE FOR THEM HERE
 I HAVE KNOWN SO FEW WAYS OFMAKING MY LIFE GOOD FOR ANYTHING
 OF COURSE MY NOTIONS OF USEFULNESSMUST BE NARROW
 I MUST LEARN NEW WAYS OF HELPING PEOPLE
DOUBTLESS SAID MR
 CASAUBON
 EACH POSITION HAS ITS CORRESPONDINGDUTIES
 YOURS I TRUST AS THE MISTRESS OF LOWICK WILL NOT LEAVE ANYYEARNING UNFULFILLED
INDEED I BELIEVE THAT SAID DOROTHEA EARNESTLY
 DO NOT SUPPOSETHAT I AM SAD
THAT IS WELL
 BUT IF YOU ARE NOT TIRED WE WILL TAKE ANOTHER WAY TOTHE HOUSE THAN THAT BY WHICH WE CAME
DOROTHEA WAS NOT AT ALL TIRED AND A LITTLE CIRCUIT WAS MADE TOWARDS AFINE YEWTREE THE CHIEF HEREDITARY GLORY OF THE GROUNDS ON THIS SIDEOF THE HOUSE
 AS THEY APPROACHED IT A FIGURE CONSPICUOUS ON A DARKBACKGROUND OF EVERGREENS WAS SEATED ON A BENCH SKETCHING THE OLDTREE
 MR
 BROOKE WHO WAS WALKING IN FRONT WITH CELIA TURNED HIS HEADAND SAIDWHO IS THAT YOUNGSTER CASAUBON
THEY HAD COME VERY NEAR WHEN MR
 CASAUBON ANSWEREDTHAT IS A YOUNG RELATIVE OF MINE A SECOND COUSIN THE GRANDSON INFACT HE ADDED LOOKING AT DOROTHEA OF THE LADY WHOSE PORTRAIT YOUHAVE BEEN NOTICING MY AUNT JULIA
THE YOUNG MAN HAD LAID DOWN HIS SKETCHBOOK AND RISEN
 HIS BUSHYLIGHTBROWN CURLS AS WELL AS HIS YOUTHFULNESS IDENTIFIED HIM AT ONCEWITH CELIAS APPARITION
DOROTHEA LET ME INTRODUCE TO YOU MY COUSIN MR
 LADISLAW
 WILL THISIS MISS BROOKE
THE COUSIN WAS SO CLOSE NOW THAT WHEN HE LIFTED HIS HAT DOROTHEACOULD SEE A PAIR OF GRAY EYES RATHER NEAR TOGETHER A DELICATEIRREGULAR NOSE WITH A LITTLE RIPPLE IN IT AND HAIR FALLING BACKWARDBUT THERE WAS A MOUTH AND CHIN OF A MORE PROMINENT THREATENING ASPECTTHAN BELONGED TO THE TYPE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS MINIATURE
 YOUNGLADISLAW DID NOT FEEL IT NECESSARY TO SMILE AS IF HE WERE CHARMED WITHTHIS INTRODUCTION TO HIS FUTURE SECOND COUSIN AND HER RELATIVES BUTWORE RATHER A POUTING AIR OF DISCONTENT
YOU ARE AN ARTIST I SEE SAID MR
 BROOKE TAKING UP THE SKETCHBOOKAND TURNING IT OVER IN HIS UNCEREMONIOUS FASHION
NO I ONLY SKETCH A LITTLE
 THERE IS NOTHING FIT TO BE SEEN THERESAID YOUNG LADISLAW COLORING PERHAPS WITH TEMPER RATHER THAN MODESTY
OH COME THIS IS A NICE BIT NOW
 I DID A LITTLE IN THIS WAY MYSELFAT ONE TIME YOU KNOW
 LOOK HERE NOW THIS IS WHAT I CALL A NICETHING DONE WITH WHAT WE USED TO CALL BRIO
 MR
 BROOKE HELD OUTTOWARDS THE TWO GIRLS A LARGE COLORED SKETCH OF STONY GROUND AND TREESWITH A POOL
I AM NO JUDGE OF THESE THINGS SAID DOROTHEA NOT COLDLY BUT WITH ANEAGER DEPRECATION OF THE APPEAL TO HER
 YOU KNOW UNCLE I NEVER SEETHE BEAUTY OF THOSE PICTURES WHICH YOU SAY ARE SO MUCH PRAISED
 THEYARE A LANGUAGE I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
 I SUPPOSE THERE IS SOME RELATIONBETWEEN PICTURES AND NATURE WHICH I AM TOO IGNORANT TO FEELJUST AS YOUSEE WHAT A GREEK SENTENCE STANDS FOR WHICH MEANS NOTHING TO ME
DOROTHEA LOOKED UP AT MR
 CASAUBON WHO BOWED HIS HEAD TOWARDS HERWHILE MR
 BROOKE SAID SMILING NONCHALANTLYBLESS ME NOW HOW DIFFERENT PEOPLE ARE
 BUT YOU HAD A BAD STYLE OFTEACHING YOU KNOWELSE THIS IS JUST THE THING FOR GIRLSSKETCHINGFINE ART AND SO ON
 BUT YOU TOOK TO DRAWING PLANS YOU DONT UNDERSTANDMORBIDEZZA AND THAT KIND OF THING
 YOU WILL COME TO MY HOUSE IHOPE AND I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT I DID IN THIS WAY HE CONTINUEDTURNING TO YOUNG LADISLAW WHO HAD TO BE RECALLED FROM HISPREOCCUPATION IN OBSERVING DOROTHEA
 LADISLAW HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THATSHE MUST BE AN UNPLEASANT GIRL SINCE SHE WAS GOING TO MARRY CASAUBONAND WHAT SHE SAID OF HER STUPIDITY ABOUT PICTURES WOULD HAVE CONFIRMEDTHAT OPINION EVEN IF HE HAD BELIEVED HER
 AS IT WAS HE TOOK HER WORDSFOR A COVERT JUDGMENT AND WAS CERTAIN THAT SHE THOUGHT HIS SKETCHDETESTABLE
 THERE WAS TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS IN HER APOLOGY SHE WASLAUGHING BOTH AT HER UNCLE AND HIMSELF
 BUT WHAT A VOICE
 IT WAS LIKETHE VOICE OF A SOUL THAT HAD ONCE LIVED IN AN AEOLIAN HARP
 THIS MUSTBE ONE OF NATURES INCONSISTENCIES
 THERE COULD BE NO SORT OF PASSIONIN A GIRL WHO WOULD MARRY CASAUBON
 BUT HE TURNED FROM HER AND BOWEDHIS THANKS FOR MR
 BROOKES INVITATION
WE WILL TURN OVER MY ITALIAN ENGRAVINGS TOGETHER CONTINUED THATGOODNATURED MAN
 I HAVE NO END OF THOSE THINGS THAT I HAVE LAID BYFOR YEARS
 ONE GETS RUSTY IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW
 NOTYOU CASAUBON YOU STICK TO YOUR STUDIES BUT MY BEST IDEAS GETUNDERMOSTOUT OF USE YOU KNOW
 YOU CLEVER YOUNG MEN MUST GUARD AGAINSTINDOLENCE
 I WAS TOO INDOLENT YOU KNOW ELSE I MIGHT HAVE BEENANYWHERE AT ONE TIME
THAT IS A SEASONABLE ADMONITION SAID MR
 CASAUBON BUT NOW WE WILLPASS ON TO THE HOUSE LEST THE YOUNG LADIES SHOULD BE TIRED OFSTANDING
WHEN THEIR BACKS WERE TURNED YOUNG LADISLAW SAT DOWN TO GO ON WITH HISSKETCHING AND AS HE DID SO HIS FACE BROKE INTO AN EXPRESSION OFAMUSEMENT WHICH INCREASED AS HE WENT ON DRAWING TILL AT LAST HE THREWBACK HIS HEAD AND LAUGHED ALOUD
 PARTLY IT WAS THE RECEPTION OF HIS OWNARTISTIC PRODUCTION THAT TICKLED HIM PARTLY THE NOTION OF HIS GRAVECOUSIN AS THE LOVER OF THAT GIRL AND PARTLY MR
 BROOKES DEFINITION OFTHE PLACE HE MIGHT HAVE HELD BUT FOR THE IMPEDIMENT OF INDOLENCE
 MR
WILL LADISLAWS SENSE OF THE LUDICROUS LIT UP HIS FEATURES VERYAGREEABLY IT WAS THE PURE ENJOYMENT OF COMICALITY AND HAD NO MIXTUREOF SNEERING AND SELFEXALTATION
WHAT IS YOUR NEPHEW GOING TO DO WITH HIMSELF CASAUBON
 SAID MR
BROOKE AS THEY WENT ON
MY COUSIN YOU MEANNOT MY NEPHEW
YES YES COUSIN
 BUT IN THE WAY OF A CAREER YOU KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS PAINFULLY DOUBTFUL
 ON LEAVING RUGBY HEDECLINED TO GO TO AN ENGLISH UNIVERSITY WHERE I WOULD GLADLY HAVEPLACED HIM AND CHOSE WHAT I MUST CONSIDER THE ANOMALOUS COURSE OFSTUDYING AT HEIDELBERG
 AND NOW HE WANTS TO GO ABROAD AGAIN WITHOUTANY SPECIAL OBJECT SAVE THE VAGUE PURPOSE OF WHAT HE CALLS CULTUREPREPARATION FOR HE KNOWS NOT WHAT
 HE DECLINES TO CHOOSE A PROFESSION
HE HAS NO MEANS BUT WHAT YOU FURNISH I SUPPOSE
I HAVE ALWAYS GIVEN HIM AND HIS FRIENDS REASON TO UNDERSTAND THAT IWOULD FURNISH IN MODERATION WHAT WAS NECESSARY FOR PROVIDING HIM WITH ASCHOLARLY EDUCATION AND LAUNCHING HIM RESPECTABLY
 I AM THEREFOREBOUND TO FULFIL THE EXPECTATION SO RAISED SAID MR
 CASAUBON PUTTINGHIS CONDUCT IN THE LIGHT OF MERE RECTITUDE A TRAIT OF DELICACY WHICHDOROTHEA NOTICED WITH ADMIRATION
HE HAS A THIRST FOR TRAVELLING PERHAPS HE MAY TURN OUT A BRUCE OR AMUNGO PARK SAID MR
 BROOKE
 I HAD A NOTION OF THAT MYSELF AT ONETIME
NO HE HAS NO BENT TOWARDS EXPLORATION OR THE ENLARGEMENT OF OURGEOGNOSIS THAT WOULD BE A SPECIAL PURPOSE WHICH I COULD RECOGNIZE WITHSOME APPROBATION THOUGH WITHOUT FELICITATING HIM ON A CAREER WHICH SOOFTEN ENDS IN PREMATURE AND VIOLENT DEATH
 BUT SO FAR IS HE FROM HAVINGANY DESIRE FOR A MORE ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE EARTHS SURFACE THATHE SAID HE SHOULD PREFER NOT TO KNOW THE SOURCES OF THE NILE AND THATTHERE SHOULD BE SOME UNKNOWN REGIONS PRESERVED AS HUNTING GROUNDS FORTHE POETIC IMAGINATION
WELL THERE IS SOMETHING IN THAT YOU KNOW SAID MR
 BROOKE WHO HADCERTAINLY AN IMPARTIAL MIND
IT IS I FEAR NOTHING MORE THAN A PART OF HIS GENERAL INACCURACY ANDINDISPOSITION TO THOROUGHNESS OF ALL KINDS WHICH WOULD BE A BAD AUGURYFOR HIM IN ANY PROFESSION CIVIL OR SACRED EVEN WERE HE SO FARSUBMISSIVE TO ORDINARY RULE AS TO CHOOSE ONE
PERHAPS HE HAS CONSCIENTIOUS SCRUPLES FOUNDED ON HIS OWN UNFITNESSSAID DOROTHEA WHO WAS INTERESTING HERSELF IN FINDING A FAVORABLEEXPLANATION
 BECAUSE THE LAW AND MEDICINE SHOULD BE VERY SERIOUSPROFESSIONS TO UNDERTAKE SHOULD THEY NOT
 PEOPLES LIVES AND FORTUNESDEPEND ON THEM
DOUBTLESS BUT I FEAR THAT MY YOUNG RELATIVE WILL LADISLAW IS CHIEFLYDETERMINED IN HIS AVERSION TO THESE CALLINGS BY A DISLIKE TO STEADYAPPLICATION AND TO THAT KIND OF ACQUIREMENT WHICH IS NEEDFULINSTRUMENTALLY BUT IS NOT CHARMING OR IMMEDIATELY INVITING TOSELFINDULGENT TASTE
 I HAVE INSISTED TO HIM ON WHAT ARISTOTLE HASSTATED WITH ADMIRABLE BREVITY THAT FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ANY WORKREGARDED AS AN END THERE MUST BE A PRIOR EXERCISE OF MANY ENERGIES ORACQUIRED FACILITIES OF A SECONDARY ORDER DEMANDING PATIENCE
 I HAVEPOINTED TO MY OWN MANUSCRIPT VOLUMES WHICH REPRESENT THE TOIL OF YEARSPREPARATORY TO A WORK NOT YET ACCOMPLISHED
 BUT IN VAIN
 TO CAREFULREASONING OF THIS KIND HE REPLIES BY CALLING HIMSELF PEGASUS AND EVERYFORM OF PRESCRIBED WORK HARNESS
CELIA LAUGHED
 SHE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT MR
 CASAUBON COULD SAYSOMETHING QUITE AMUSING
WELL YOU KNOW HE MAY TURN OUT A BYRON A CHATTERTON ACHURCHILLTHAT SORT OF THINGTHERES NO TELLING SAID MR
 BROOKE
SHALL YOU LET HIM GO TO ITALY OR WHEREVER ELSE HE WANTS TO GO
YES I HAVE AGREED TO FURNISH HIM WITH MODERATE SUPPLIES FOR A YEAR ORSO HE ASKS NO MORE
 I SHALL LET HIM BE TRIED BY THE TEST OF FREEDOM
THAT IS VERY KIND OF YOU SAID DOROTHEA LOOKING UP AT MR
 CASAUBONWITH DELIGHT
 IT IS NOBLE
 AFTER ALL PEOPLE MAY REALLY HAVE IN THEMSOME VOCATION WHICH IS NOT QUITE PLAIN TO THEMSELVES MAY THEY NOT
THEY MAY SEEM IDLE AND WEAK BECAUSE THEY ARE GROWING
 WE SHOULD BE VERYPATIENT WITH EACH OTHER I THINK
I SUPPOSE IT IS BEING ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED THAT HAS MADE YOU THINKPATIENCE GOOD SAID CELIA AS SOON AS SHE AND DOROTHEA WERE ALONETOGETHER TAKING OFF THEIR WRAPPINGS
YOU MEAN THAT I AM VERY IMPATIENT CELIA
YES WHEN PEOPLE DONT DO AND SAY JUST WHAT YOU LIKE
 CELIA HADBECOME LESS AFRAID OF SAYING THINGS TO DOROTHEA SINCE THISENGAGEMENT CLEVERNESS SEEMED TO HER MORE PITIABLE THAN EVER
CHAPTER X
HE HAD CATCHED A GREAT COLD HAD HE HAD NO OTHER CLOTHES TO WEAR THANTHE SKIN OF A BEAR NOT YET KILLED
FULLER
YOUNG LADISLAW DID NOT PAY THAT VISIT TO WHICH MR
 BROOKE HAD INVITEDHIM AND ONLY SIX DAYS AFTERWARDS MR
 CASAUBON MENTIONED THAT HIS YOUNGRELATIVE HAD STARTED FOR THE CONTINENT SEEMING BY THIS COLD VAGUENESSTO WAIVE INQUIRY
 INDEED WILL HAD DECLINED TO FIX ON ANY MORE PRECISEDESTINATION THAN THE ENTIRE AREA OF EUROPE
 GENIUS HE HELD ISNECESSARILY INTOLERANT OF FETTERS ON THE ONE HAND IT MUST HAVE THEUTMOST PLAY FOR ITS SPONTANEITY ON THE OTHER IT MAY CONFIDENTLY AWAITTHOSE MESSAGES FROM THE UNIVERSE WHICH SUMMON IT TO ITS PECULIAR WORKONLY PLACING ITSELF IN AN ATTITUDE OF RECEPTIVITY TOWARDS ALL SUBLIMECHANCES
 THE ATTITUDES OF RECEPTIVITY ARE VARIOUS AND WILL HADSINCERELY TRIED MANY OF THEM
 HE WAS NOT EXCESSIVELY FOND OF WINE BUTHE HAD SEVERAL TIMES TAKEN TOO MUCH SIMPLY AS AN EXPERIMENT IN THATFORM OF ECSTASY HE HAD FASTED TILL HE WAS FAINT AND THEN SUPPED ONLOBSTER HE HAD MADE HIMSELF ILL WITH DOSES OF OPIUM
 NOTHING GREATLYORIGINAL HAD RESULTED FROM THESE MEASURES AND THE EFFECTS OF THE OPIUMHAD CONVINCED HIM THAT THERE WAS AN ENTIRE DISSIMILARITY BETWEEN HISCONSTITUTION AND DE QUINCEYS
 THE SUPERADDED CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH WOULDEVOLVE THE GENIUS HAD NOT YET COME THE UNIVERSE HAD NOT YET BECKONED
EVEN CAESARS FORTUNE AT ONE TIME WAS BUT A GRAND PRESENTIMENT
 WE KNOWWHAT A MASQUERADE ALL DEVELOPMENT IS AND WHAT EFFECTIVE SHAPES MAY BEDISGUISED IN HELPLESS EMBRYOS
 IN FACT THE WORLD IS FULL OF HOPEFULANALOGIES AND HANDSOME DUBIOUS EGGS CALLED POSSIBILITIES
 WILL SAWCLEARLY ENOUGH THE PITIABLE INSTANCES OF LONG INCUBATION PRODUCING NOCHICK AND BUT FOR GRATITUDE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT CASAUBON WHOSEPLODDING APPLICATION ROWS OF NOTEBOOKS AND SMALL TAPER OF LEARNEDTHEORY EXPLORING THE TOSSED RUINS OF THE WORLD SEEMED TO ENFORCE AMORAL ENTIRELY ENCOURAGING TO WILLS GENEROUS RELIANCE ON THEINTENTIONS OF THE UNIVERSE WITH REGARD TO HIMSELF
 HE HELD THATRELIANCE TO BE A MARK OF GENIUS AND CERTAINLY IT IS NO MARK TO THECONTRARY GENIUS CONSISTING NEITHER IN SELFCONCEIT NOR IN HUMILITYBUT IN A POWER TO MAKE OR DO NOT ANYTHING IN GENERAL BUT SOMETHING INPARTICULAR
 LET HIM START FOR THE CONTINENT THEN WITHOUT OURPRONOUNCING ON HIS FUTURE
 AMONG ALL FORMS OF MISTAKE PROPHECY IS THEMOST GRATUITOUS
BUT AT PRESENT THIS CAUTION AGAINST A TOO HASTY JUDGMENT INTERESTS MEMORE IN RELATION TO MR
 CASAUBON THAN TO HIS YOUNG COUSIN
 IF TODOROTHEA MR
 CASAUBON HAD BEEN THE MERE OCCASION WHICH HAD SET ALIGHTTHE FINE INFLAMMABLE MATERIAL OF HER YOUTHFUL ILLUSIONS DOES IT FOLLOWTHAT HE WAS FAIRLY REPRESENTED IN THE MINDS OF THOSE LESS IMPASSIONEDPERSONAGES WHO HAVE HITHERTO DELIVERED THEIR JUDGMENTS CONCERNING HIM
I PROTEST AGAINST ANY ABSOLUTE CONCLUSION ANY PREJUDICE DERIVED FROMMRS
 CADWALLADERS CONTEMPT FOR A NEIGHBORING CLERGYMANS ALLEGEDGREATNESS OF SOUL OR SIR JAMES CHETTAMS POOR OPINION OF HIS RIVALSLEGSFROM MR
 BROOKES FAILURE TO ELICIT A COMPANIONS IDEAS OR FROMCELIAS CRITICISM OF A MIDDLEAGED SCHOLARS PERSONAL APPEARANCE
 I AMNOT SURE THAT THE GREATEST MAN OF HIS AGE IF EVER THAT SOLITARYSUPERLATIVE EXISTED COULD ESCAPE THESE UNFAVORABLE REFLECTIONS OFHIMSELF IN VARIOUS SMALL MIRRORS AND EVEN MILTON LOOKING FOR HISPORTRAIT IN A SPOON MUST SUBMIT TO HAVE THE FACIAL ANGLE OF A BUMPKIN
MOREOVER IF MR
 CASAUBON SPEAKING FOR HIMSELF HAS RATHER A CHILLINGRHETORIC IT IS NOT THEREFORE CERTAIN THAT THERE IS NO GOOD WORK ORFINE FEELING IN HIM
 DID NOT AN IMMORTAL PHYSICIST AND INTERPRETER OFHIEROGLYPHS WRITE DETESTABLE VERSES
 HAS THE THEORY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEMBEEN ADVANCED BY GRACEFUL MANNERS AND CONVERSATIONAL TACT
 SUPPOSE WETURN FROM OUTSIDE ESTIMATES OF A MAN TO WONDER WITH KEENER INTERESTWHAT IS THE REPORT OF HIS OWN CONSCIOUSNESS ABOUT HIS DOINGS ORCAPACITY WITH WHAT HINDRANCES HE IS CARRYING ON HIS DAILY LABORS WHATFADING OF HOPES OR WHAT DEEPER FIXITY OF SELFDELUSION THE YEARS AREMARKING OFF WITHIN HIM AND WITH WHAT SPIRIT HE WRESTLES AGAINSTUNIVERSAL PRESSURE WHICH WILL ONE DAY BE TOO HEAVY FOR HIM AND BRINGHIS HEART TO ITS FINAL PAUSE
 DOUBTLESS HIS LOT IS IMPORTANT IN HIS OWNEYES AND THE CHIEF REASON THAT WE THINK HE ASKS TOO LARGE A PLACE INOUR CONSIDERATION MUST BE OUR WANT OF ROOM FOR HIM SINCE WE REFER HIMTO THE DIVINE REGARD WITH PERFECT CONFIDENCE NAY IT IS EVEN HELDSUBLIME FOR OUR NEIGHBOR TO EXPECT THE UTMOST THERE HOWEVER LITTLE HEMAY HAVE GOT FROM US
 MR
 CASAUBON TOO WAS THE CENTRE OF HIS OWNWORLD IF HE WAS LIABLE TO THINK THAT OTHERS WERE PROVIDENTIALLY MADEFOR HIM AND ESPECIALLY TO CONSIDER THEM IN THE LIGHT OF THEIR FITNESSFOR THE AUTHOR OF A KEY TO ALL MYTHOLOGIES THIS TRAIT IS NOT QUITEALIEN TO US AND LIKE THE OTHER MENDICANT HOPES OF MORTALS CLAIMSSOME OF OUR PITY
CERTAINLY THIS AFFAIR OF HIS MARRIAGE WITH MISS BROOKE TOUCHED HIM MORENEARLY THAN IT DID ANY ONE OF THE PERSONS WHO HAVE HITHERTO SHOWN THEIRDISAPPROVAL OF IT AND IN THE PRESENT STAGE OF THINGS I FEEL MORETENDERLY TOWARDS HIS EXPERIENCE OF SUCCESS THAN TOWARDS THEDISAPPOINTMENT OF THE AMIABLE SIR JAMES
 FOR IN TRUTH AS THE DAY FIXEDFOR HIS MARRIAGE CAME NEARER MR
 CASAUBON DID NOT FIND HIS SPIRITSRISING NOR DID THE CONTEMPLATION OF THAT MATRIMONIAL GARDEN SCENEWHERE AS ALL EXPERIENCE SHOWED THE PATH WAS TO BE BORDERED WITHFLOWERS PROVE PERSISTENTLY MORE ENCHANTING TO HIM THAN THE ACCUSTOMEDVAULTS WHERE HE WALKED TAPER IN HAND
 HE DID NOT CONFESS TO HIMSELFSTILL LESS COULD HE HAVE BREATHED TO ANOTHER HIS SURPRISE THAT THOUGHHE HAD WON A LOVELY AND NOBLEHEARTED GIRL HE HAD NOT WONDELIGHTWHICH HE HAD ALSO REGARDED AS AN OBJECT TO BE FOUND BY SEARCH
IT IS TRUE THAT HE KNEW ALL THE CLASSICAL PASSAGES IMPLYING THECONTRARY BUT KNOWING CLASSICAL PASSAGES WE FIND IS A MODE OF MOTIONWHICH EXPLAINS WHY THEY LEAVE SO LITTLE EXTRA FORCE FOR THEIR PERSONALAPPLICATION
POOR MR
 CASAUBON HAD IMAGINED THAT HIS LONG STUDIOUS BACHELORHOOD HADSTORED UP FOR HIM A COMPOUND INTEREST OF ENJOYMENT AND THAT LARGEDRAFTS ON HIS AFFECTIONS WOULD NOT FAIL TO BE HONORED FOR WE ALL OFUS GRAVE OR LIGHT GET OUR THOUGHTS ENTANGLED IN METAPHORS AND ACTFATALLY ON THE STRENGTH OF THEM
 AND NOW HE WAS IN DANGER OF BEINGSADDENED BY THE VERY CONVICTION THAT HIS CIRCUMSTANCES WERE UNUSUALLYHAPPY THERE WAS NOTHING EXTERNAL BY WHICH HE COULD ACCOUNT FOR ACERTAIN BLANKNESS OF SENSIBILITY WHICH CAME OVER HIM JUST WHEN HISEXPECTANT GLADNESS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MOST LIVELY JUST WHEN HE EXCHANGEDTHE ACCUSTOMED DULNESS OF HIS LOWICK LIBRARY FOR HIS VISITS TO THEGRANGE
 HERE WAS A WEARY EXPERIENCE IN WHICH HE WAS AS UTTERLYCONDEMNED TO LONELINESS AS IN THE DESPAIR WHICH SOMETIMES THREATENEDHIM WHILE TOILING IN THE MORASS OF AUTHORSHIP WITHOUT SEEMING NEARER TOTHE GOAL
 AND HIS WAS THAT WORST LONELINESS WHICH WOULD SHRINK FROMSYMPATHY
 HE COULD NOT BUT WISH THAT DOROTHEA SHOULD THINK HIM NOT LESSHAPPY THAN THE WORLD WOULD EXPECT HER SUCCESSFUL SUITOR TO BE AND INRELATION TO HIS AUTHORSHIP HE LEANED ON HER YOUNG TRUST AND VENERATIONHE LIKED TO DRAW FORTH HER FRESH INTEREST IN LISTENING AS A MEANS OFENCOURAGEMENT TO HIMSELF IN TALKING TO HER HE PRESENTED ALL HISPERFORMANCE AND INTENTION WITH THE REFLECTED CONFIDENCE OF THEPEDAGOGUE AND RID HIMSELF FOR THE TIME OF THAT CHILLING IDEAL AUDIENCEWHICH CROWDED HIS LABORIOUS UNCREATIVE HOURS WITH THE VAPOROUS PRESSUREOF TARTAREAN SHADES
FOR TO DOROTHEA AFTER THAT TOYBOX HISTORY OF THE WORLD ADAPTED TOYOUNG LADIES WHICH HAD MADE THE CHIEF PART OF HER EDUCATION MR
CASAUBONS TALK ABOUT HIS GREAT BOOK WAS FULL OF NEW VISTAS AND THISSENSE OF REVELATION THIS SURPRISE OF A NEARER INTRODUCTION TO STOICSAND ALEXANDRIANS AS PEOPLE WHO HAD IDEAS NOT TOTALLY UNLIKE HER OWNKEPT IN ABEYANCE FOR THE TIME HER USUAL EAGERNESS FOR A BINDING THEORYWHICH COULD BRING HER OWN LIFE AND DOCTRINE INTO STRICT CONNECTION WITHTHAT AMAZING PAST AND GIVE THE REMOTEST SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE SOMEBEARING ON HER ACTIONS
 THAT MORE COMPLETE TEACHING WOULD COMEMR
CASAUBON WOULD TELL HER ALL THAT SHE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO HIGHERINITIATION IN IDEAS AS SHE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO MARRIAGE ANDBLENDING HER DIM CONCEPTIONS OF BOTH
 IT WOULD BE A GREAT MISTAKE TOSUPPOSE THAT DOROTHEA WOULD HAVE CARED ABOUT ANY SHARE IN MR
CASAUBONS LEARNING AS MERE ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR THOUGH OPINION IN THENEIGHBORHOOD OF FRESHITT AND TIPTON HAD PRONOUNCED HER CLEVER THATEPITHET WOULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED HER TO CIRCLES IN WHOSE MORE PRECISEVOCABULARY CLEVERNESS IMPLIES MERE APTITUDE FOR KNOWING AND DOINGAPART FROM CHARACTER
 ALL HER EAGERNESS FOR ACQUIREMENT LAY WITHIN THATFULL CURRENT OF SYMPATHETIC MOTIVE IN WHICH HER IDEAS AND IMPULSES WEREHABITUALLY SWEPT ALONG
 SHE DID NOT WANT TO DECK HERSELF WITHKNOWLEDGETO WEAR IT LOOSE FROM THE NERVES AND BLOOD THAT FED HERACTION AND IF SHE HAD WRITTEN A BOOK SHE MUST HAVE DONE IT AS SAINTTHERESA DID UNDER THE COMMAND OF AN AUTHORITY THAT CONSTRAINED HERCONSCIENCE
 BUT SOMETHING SHE YEARNED FOR BY WHICH HER LIFE MIGHT BEFILLED WITH ACTION AT ONCE RATIONAL AND ARDENT AND SINCE THE TIME WASGONE BY FOR GUIDING VISIONS AND SPIRITUAL DIRECTORS SINCE PRAYERHEIGHTENED YEARNING BUT NOT INSTRUCTION WHAT LAMP WAS THERE BUTKNOWLEDGE
 SURELY LEARNED MEN KEPT THE ONLY OIL AND WHO MORE LEARNEDTHAN MR
 CASAUBON
THUS IN THESE BRIEF WEEKS DOROTHEAS JOYOUS GRATEFUL EXPECTATION WASUNBROKEN AND HOWEVER HER LOVER MIGHT OCCASIONALLY BE CONSCIOUS OFFLATNESS HE COULD NEVER REFER IT TO ANY SLACKENING OF HER AFFECTIONATEINTEREST
THE SEASON WAS MILD ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE THE PROJECT OF EXTENDING THEWEDDING JOURNEY AS FAR AS ROME AND MR
 CASAUBON WAS ANXIOUS FOR THISBECAUSE HE WISHED TO INSPECT SOME MANUSCRIPTS IN THE VATICAN
I STILL REGRET THAT YOUR SISTER IS NOT TO ACCOMPANY US HE SAID ONEMORNING SOME TIME AFTER IT HAD BEEN ASCERTAINED THAT CELIA OBJECTED TOGO AND THAT DOROTHEA DID NOT WISH FOR HER COMPANIONSHIP
 YOU WILLHAVE MANY LONELY HOURS DOROTHEA FOR I SHALL BE CONSTRAINED TO MAKETHE UTMOST USE OF MY TIME DURING OUR STAY IN ROME AND I SHOULD FEELMORE AT LIBERTY IF YOU HAD A COMPANION
THE WORDS I SHOULD FEEL MORE AT LIBERTY GRATED ON DOROTHEA
 FOR THEFIRST TIME IN SPEAKING TO MR
 CASAUBON SHE COLORED FROM ANNOYANCE
YOU MUST HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD ME VERY MUCH SHE SAID IF YOU THINK ISHOULD NOT ENTER INTO THE VALUE OF YOUR TIMEIF YOU THINK THAT I SHOULDNOT WILLINGLY GIVE UP WHATEVER INTERFERED WITH YOUR USING IT TO THEBEST PURPOSE
THAT IS VERY AMIABLE IN YOU MY DEAR DOROTHEA SAID MR
 CASAUBON NOTIN THE LEAST NOTICING THAT SHE WAS HURT BUT IF YOU HAD A LADY AS YOURCOMPANION I COULD PUT YOU BOTH UNDER THE CARE OF A CICERONE AND WECOULD THUS ACHIEVE TWO PURPOSES IN THE SAME SPACE OF TIME
I BEG YOU WILL NOT REFER TO THIS AGAIN SAID DOROTHEA RATHERHAUGHTILY
 BUT IMMEDIATELY SHE FEARED THAT SHE WAS WRONG AND TURNINGTOWARDS HIM SHE LAID HER HAND ON HIS ADDING IN A DIFFERENT TONE PRAYDO NOT BE ANXIOUS ABOUT ME
 I SHALL HAVE SO MUCH TO THINK OF WHEN I AMALONE
 AND TANTRIPP WILL BE A SUFFICIENT COMPANION JUST TO TAKE CAREOF ME
 I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE CELIA SHE WOULD BE MISERABLE
IT WAS TIME TO DRESS
 THERE WAS TO BE A DINNERPARTY THAT DAY THE LASTOF THE PARTIES WHICH WERE HELD AT THE GRANGE AS PROPER PRELIMINARIES TOTHE WEDDING AND DOROTHEA WAS GLAD OF A REASON FOR MOVING AWAY AT ONCEON THE SOUND OF THE BELL AS IF SHE NEEDED MORE THAN HER USUAL AMOUNTOF PREPARATION
 SHE WAS ASHAMED OF BEING IRRITATED FROM SOME CAUSE SHECOULD NOT DEFINE EVEN TO HERSELF FOR THOUGH SHE HAD NO INTENTION TO BEUNTRUTHFUL HER REPLY HAD NOT TOUCHED THE REAL HURT WITHIN HER
 MR
CASAUBONS WORDS HAD BEEN QUITE REASONABLE YET THEY HAD BROUGHT AVAGUE INSTANTANEOUS SENSE OF ALOOFNESS ON HIS PART
SURELY I AM IN A STRANGELY SELFISH WEAK STATE OF MIND SHE SAID TOHERSELF
 HOW CAN I HAVE A HUSBAND WHO IS SO MUCH ABOVE ME WITHOUTKNOWING THAT HE NEEDS ME LESS THAN I NEED HIM
HAVING CONVINCED HERSELF THAT MR
 CASAUBON WAS ALTOGETHER RIGHT SHERECOVERED HER EQUANIMITY AND WAS AN AGREEABLE IMAGE OF SERENE DIGNITYWHEN SHE CAME INTO THE DRAWINGROOM IN HER SILVERGRAY DRESSTHE SIMPLELINES OF HER DARKBROWN HAIR PARTED OVER HER BROW AND COILED MASSIVELYBEHIND IN KEEPING WITH THE ENTIRE ABSENCE FROM HER MANNER ANDEXPRESSION OF ALL SEARCH AFTER MERE EFFECT
 SOMETIMES WHEN DOROTHEA WASIN COMPANY THERE SEEMED TO BE AS COMPLETE AN AIR OF REPOSE ABOUT HERAS IF SHE HAD BEEN A PICTURE OF SANTA BARBARA LOOKING OUT FROM HERTOWER INTO THE CLEAR AIR BUT THESE INTERVALS OF QUIETUDE MADE THEENERGY OF HER SPEECH AND EMOTION THE MORE REMARKED WHEN SOME OUTWARDAPPEAL HAD TOUCHED HER
SHE WAS NATURALLY THE SUBJECT OF MANY OBSERVATIONS THIS EVENING FORTHE DINNERPARTY WAS LARGE AND RATHER MORE MISCELLANEOUS AS TO THE MALEPORTION THAN ANY WHICH HAD BEEN HELD AT THE GRANGE SINCE MR
 BROOKESNIECES HAD RESIDED WITH HIM SO THAT THE TALKING WAS DONE IN DUOS ANDTRIOS MORE OR LESS INHARMONIOUS
 THERE WAS THE NEWLY ELECTED MAYOR OFMIDDLEMARCH WHO HAPPENED TO BE A MANUFACTURER THE PHILANTHROPICBANKER HIS BROTHERINLAW WHO PREDOMINATED SO MUCH IN THE TOWN THATSOME CALLED HIM A METHODIST OTHERS A HYPOCRITE ACCORDING TO THERESOURCES OF THEIR VOCABULARY AND THERE WERE VARIOUS PROFESSIONAL MEN
IN FACT MRS
 CADWALLADER SAID THAT BROOKE WAS BEGINNING TO TREAT THEMIDDLEMARCHERS AND THAT SHE PREFERRED THE FARMERS AT THE TITHEDINNERWHO DRANK HER HEALTH UNPRETENTIOUSLY AND WERE NOT ASHAMED OF THEIRGRANDFATHERS FURNITURE
 FOR IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY BEFORE REFORMHAD DONE ITS NOTABLE PART IN DEVELOPING THE POLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESSTHERE WAS A CLEARER DISTINCTION OF RANKS AND A DIMMER DISTINCTION OFPARTIES SO THAT MR
 BROOKES MISCELLANEOUS INVITATIONS SEEMED TOBELONG TO THAT GENERAL LAXITY WHICH CAME FROM HIS INORDINATE TRAVEL ANDHABIT OF TAKING TOO MUCH IN THE FORM OF IDEAS
ALREADY AS MISS BROOKE PASSED OUT OF THE DININGROOM OPPORTUNITY WASFOUND FOR SOME INTERJECTIONAL ASIDES
A FINE WOMAN MISS BROOKE
 AN UNCOMMONLY FINE WOMAN BY GOD
 SAID MR
STANDISH THE OLD LAWYER WHO HAD BEEN SO LONG CONCERNED WITH THELANDED GENTRY THAT HE HAD BECOME LANDED HIMSELF AND USED THAT OATH INA DEEPMOUTHED MANNER AS A SORT OF ARMORIAL BEARINGS STAMPING THESPEECH OF A MAN WHO HELD A GOOD POSITION
MR
 BULSTRODE THE BANKER SEEMED TO BE ADDRESSED BUT THAT GENTLEMANDISLIKED COARSENESS AND PROFANITY AND MERELY BOWED
 THE REMARK WASTAKEN UP BY MR
 CHICHELY A MIDDLEAGED BACHELOR AND COURSINGCELEBRITY WHO HAD A COMPLEXION SOMETHING LIKE AN EASTER EGG A FEWHAIRS CAREFULLY ARRANGED AND A CARRIAGE IMPLYING THE CONSCIOUSNESS OFA DISTINGUISHED APPEARANCE
YES BUT NOT MY STYLE OF WOMAN I LIKE A WOMAN WHO LAYS HERSELF OUT ALITTLE MORE TO PLEASE US
 THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE FILIGREE ABOUT AWOMANSOMETHING OF THE COQUETTE
 A MAN LIKES A SORT OF CHALLENGE
 THEMORE OF A DEAD SET SHE MAKES AT YOU THE BETTER
THERES SOME TRUTH IN THAT SAID MR
 STANDISH DISPOSED TO BE GENIAL
AND BY GOD ITS USUALLY THE WAY WITH THEM
 I SUPPOSE IT ANSWERS SOMEWISE ENDS PROVIDENCE MADE THEM SO EH BULSTRODE
I SHOULD BE DISPOSED TO REFER COQUETRY TO ANOTHER SOURCE SAID MR
BULSTRODE
 I SHOULD RATHER REFER IT TO THE DEVIL
AY TO BE SURE THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE DEVIL IN A WOMAN SAID MR
CHICHELY WHOSE STUDY OF THE FAIR SEX SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN DETRIMENTALTO HIS THEOLOGY
 AND I LIKE THEM BLOND WITH A CERTAIN GAIT AND ASWAN NECK
 BETWEEN OURSELVES THE MAYORS DAUGHTER IS MORE TO MY TASTETHAN MISS BROOKE OR MISS CELIA EITHER
 IF I WERE A MARRYING MAN ISHOULD CHOOSE MISS VINCY BEFORE EITHER OF THEM
WELL MAKE UP MAKE UP SAID MR
 STANDISH JOCOSELY YOU SEE THEMIDDLEAGED FELLOWS CARRY THE DAY
MR
 CHICHELY SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH MUCH MEANING HE WAS NOT GOING TOINCUR THE CERTAINTY OF BEING ACCEPTED BY THE WOMAN HE WOULD CHOOSE
THE MISS VINCY WHO HAD THE HONOR OF BEING MR
 CHICHELYS IDEAL WAS OFCOURSE NOT PRESENT FOR MR
 BROOKE ALWAYS OBJECTING TO GO TOO FARWOULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN THAT HIS NIECES SHOULD MEET THE DAUGHTER OF AMIDDLEMARCH MANUFACTURER UNLESS IT WERE ON A PUBLIC OCCASION
 THEFEMININE PART OF THE COMPANY INCLUDED NONE WHOM LADY CHETTAM OR MRS
CADWALLADER COULD OBJECT TO FOR MRS
 RENFREW THE COLONELS WIDOW WASNOT ONLY UNEXCEPTIONABLE IN POINT OF BREEDING BUT ALSO INTERESTING ONTHE GROUND OF HER COMPLAINT WHICH PUZZLED THE DOCTORS AND SEEMEDCLEARLY A CASE WHEREIN THE FULNESS OF PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE MIGHT NEEDTHE SUPPLEMENT OF QUACKERY
 LADY CHETTAM WHO ATTRIBUTED HER OWNREMARKABLE HEALTH TO HOMEMADE BITTERS UNITED WITH CONSTANT MEDICALATTENDANCE ENTERED WITH MUCH EXERCISE OF THE IMAGINATION INTO MRS
RENFREWS ACCOUNT OF SYMPTOMS AND INTO THE AMAZING FUTILITY IN HERCASE OF ALL STRENGTHENING MEDICINES
WHERE CAN ALL THE STRENGTH OF THOSE MEDICINES GO MY DEAR
 SAID THEMILD BUT STATELY DOWAGER TURNING TO MRS
 CADWALLADER REFLECTIVELYWHEN MRS
 RENFREWS ATTENTION WAS CALLED AWAY
IT STRENGTHENS THE DISEASE SAID THE RECTORS WIFE MUCH TOOWELLBORN NOT TO BE AN AMATEUR IN MEDICINE
 EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON THECONSTITUTION SOME PEOPLE MAKE FAT SOME BLOOD AND SOME BILETHATS MYVIEW OF THE MATTER AND WHATEVER THEY TAKE IS A SORT OF GRIST TO THEMILL
THEN SHE OUGHT TO TAKE MEDICINES THAT WOULD REDUCEREDUCE THE DISEASEYOU KNOW IF YOU ARE RIGHT MY DEAR
 AND I THINK WHAT YOU SAY ISREASONABLE
CERTAINLY IT IS REASONABLE
 YOU HAVE TWO SORTS OF POTATOES FED ON THESAME SOIL
 ONE OF THEM GROWS MORE AND MORE WATERYAH
 LIKE THIS POOR MRS
 RENFREWTHAT IS WHAT I THINK
 DROPSY
 THERE ISNO SWELLING YETIT IS INWARD
 I SHOULD SAY SHE OUGHT TO TAKE DRYINGMEDICINES SHOULDNT YOU
OR A DRY HOTAIR BATH
 MANY THINGS MIGHT BETRIED OF A DRYING NATURE
LET HER TRY A CERTAIN PERSONS PAMPHLETS SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER IN ANUNDERTONE SEEING THE GENTLEMEN ENTER
 HE DOES NOT WANT DRYING
WHO MY DEAR
 SAID LADY CHETTAM A CHARMING WOMAN NOT SO QUICK AS TONULLIFY THE PLEASURE OF EXPLANATION
THE BRIDEGROOMCASAUBON
 HE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN DRYING UP FASTER SINCETHE ENGAGEMENT THE FLAME OF PASSION I SUPPOSE
I SHOULD THINK HE IS FAR FROM HAVING A GOOD CONSTITUTION SAID LADYCHETTAM WITH A STILL DEEPER UNDERTONE
 AND THEN HIS STUDIESSO VERYDRY AS YOU SAY
REALLY BY THE SIDE OF SIR JAMES HE LOOKS LIKE A DEATHS HEAD SKINNEDOVER FOR THE OCCASION
 MARK MY WORDS IN A YEAR FROM THIS TIME THATGIRL WILL HATE HIM
 SHE LOOKS UP TO HIM AS AN ORACLE NOW AND BYANDBYSHE WILL BE AT THE OTHER EXTREME
 ALL FLIGHTINESS
HOW VERY SHOCKING
 I FEAR SHE IS HEADSTRONG
 BUT TELL MEYOU KNOW ALLABOUT HIMIS THERE ANYTHING VERY BAD
 WHAT IS THE TRUTH
THE TRUTH
 HE IS AS BAD AS THE WRONG PHYSICNASTY TO TAKE AND SURE TODISAGREE
THERE COULD NOT BE ANYTHING WORSE THAN THAT SAID LADY CHETTAM WITHSO VIVID A CONCEPTION OF THE PHYSIC THAT SHE SEEMED TO HAVE LEARNEDSOMETHING EXACT ABOUT MR
 CASAUBONS DISADVANTAGES
 HOWEVER JAMESWILL HEAR NOTHING AGAINST MISS BROOKE
 HE SAYS SHE IS THE MIRROR OFWOMEN STILL
THAT IS A GENEROUS MAKEBELIEVE OF HIS
 DEPEND UPON IT HE LIKESLITTLE CELIA BETTER AND SHE APPRECIATES HIM
 I HOPE YOU LIKE MY LITTLECELIA
CERTAINLY SHE IS FONDER OF GERANIUMS AND SEEMS MORE DOCILE THOUGHNOT SO FINE A FIGURE
 BUT WE WERE TALKING OF PHYSIC
 TELL ME ABOUT THISNEW YOUNG SURGEON MR
 LYDGATE
 I AM TOLD HE IS WONDERFULLY CLEVER HECERTAINLY LOOKS ITA FINE BROW INDEED
HE IS A GENTLEMAN
 I HEARD HIM TALKING TO HUMPHREY
 HE TALKS WELL
YES
 MR
 BROOKE SAYS HE IS ONE OF THE LYDGATES OF NORTHUMBERLANDREALLY WELL CONNECTED
 ONE DOES NOT EXPECT IT IN A PRACTITIONER OF THATKIND
 FOR MY OWN PART I LIKE A MEDICAL MAN MORE ON A FOOTING WITH THESERVANTS THEY ARE OFTEN ALL THE CLEVERER
 I ASSURE YOU I FOUND POORHICKSS JUDGMENT UNFAILING I NEVER KNEW HIM WRONG
 HE WAS COARSE ANDBUTCHERLIKE BUT HE KNEW MY CONSTITUTION
 IT WAS A LOSS TO ME HISGOING OFF SO SUDDENLY
 DEAR ME WHAT A VERY ANIMATED CONVERSATION MISSBROOKE SEEMS TO BE HAVING WITH THIS MR
 LYDGATE
SHE IS TALKING COTTAGES AND HOSPITALS WITH HIM SAID MRS
CADWALLADER WHOSE EARS AND POWER OF INTERPRETATION WERE QUICK
 IBELIEVE HE IS A SORT OF PHILANTHROPIST SO BROOKE IS SURE TO TAKE HIMUP
JAMES SAID LADY CHETTAM WHEN HER SON CAME NEAR BRING MR
 LYDGATEAND INTRODUCE HIM TO ME
 I WANT TO TEST HIM
THE AFFABLE DOWAGER DECLARED HERSELF DELIGHTED WITH THIS OPPORTUNITY OFMAKING MR
 LYDGATES ACQUAINTANCE HAVING HEARD OF HIS SUCCESS INTREATING FEVER ON A NEW PLAN
MR
 LYDGATE HAD THE MEDICAL ACCOMPLISHMENT OF LOOKING PERFECTLY GRAVEWHATEVER NONSENSE WAS TALKED TO HIM AND HIS DARK STEADY EYES GAVE HIMIMPRESSIVENESS AS A LISTENER
 HE WAS AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE LIKE THELAMENTED HICKS ESPECIALLY IN A CERTAIN CARELESS REFINEMENT ABOUT HISTOILET AND UTTERANCE
 YET LADY CHETTAM GATHERED MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIM
HE CONFIRMED HER VIEW OF HER OWN CONSTITUTION AS BEING PECULIAR BYADMITTING THAT ALL CONSTITUTIONS MIGHT BE CALLED PECULIAR AND HE DIDNOT DENY THAT HERS MIGHT BE MORE PECULIAR THAN OTHERS
 HE DID NOTAPPROVE OF A TOO LOWERING SYSTEM INCLUDING RECKLESS CUPPING NOR ONTHE OTHER HAND OF INCESSANT PORT WINE AND BARK
 HE SAID I THINK SOWITH AN AIR OF SO MUCH DEFERENCE ACCOMPANYING THE INSIGHT OF AGREEMENTTHAT SHE FORMED THE MOST CORDIAL OPINION OF HIS TALENTS
I AM QUITE PLEASED WITH YOUR PROTEGE SHE SAID TO MR
 BROOKE BEFOREGOING AWAY
MY PROTEGE
DEAR ME
WHO IS THAT
 SAID MR
 BROOKE
THIS YOUNG LYDGATE THE NEW DOCTOR
 HE SEEMS TO ME TO UNDERSTAND HISPROFESSION ADMIRABLY
OH LYDGATE
 HE IS NOT MY PROTEGE YOU KNOW ONLY I KNEW AN UNCLE OFHIS WHO SENT ME A LETTER ABOUT HIM
 HOWEVER I THINK HE IS LIKELY TO BEFIRSTRATEHAS STUDIED IN PARIS KNEW BROUSSAIS HAS IDEAS YOUKNOWWANTS TO RAISE THE PROFESSION
LYDGATE HAS LOTS OF IDEAS QUITE NEW ABOUT VENTILATION AND DIET THATSORT OF THING RESUMED MR
 BROOKE AFTER HE HAD HANDED OUT LADYCHETTAM AND HAD RETURNED TO BE CIVIL TO A GROUP OF MIDDLEMARCHERS
HANG IT DO YOU THINK THAT IS QUITE SOUND
UPSETTING THE OLDTREATMENT WHICH HAS MADE ENGLISHMEN WHAT THEY ARE
 SAID MR
 STANDISH
MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE IS AT A LOW EBB AMONG US SAID MR
 BULSTRODE WHOSPOKE IN A SUBDUED TONE AND HAD RATHER A SICKLY AIR
 I FOR MY PARTHAIL THE ADVENT OF MR
 LYDGATE
 I HOPE TO FIND GOOD REASON FORCONFIDING THE NEW HOSPITAL TO HIS MANAGEMENT
THAT IS ALL VERY FINE REPLIED MR
 STANDISH WHO WAS NOT FOND OF MR
BULSTRODE IF YOU LIKE HIM TO TRY EXPERIMENTS ON YOUR HOSPITALPATIENTS AND KILL A FEW PEOPLE FOR CHARITY I HAVE NO OBJECTION
 BUT IAM NOT GOING TO HAND MONEY OUT OF MY PURSE TO HAVE EXPERIMENTS TRIED ONME
 I LIKE TREATMENT THAT HAS BEEN TESTED A LITTLE
WELL YOU KNOW STANDISH EVERY DOSE YOU TAKE IS AN EXPERIMENTANEXPERIMENT YOU KNOW SAID MR
 BROOKE NODDING TOWARDS THE LAWYER
OH IF YOU TALK IN THAT SENSE
 SAID MR
 STANDISH WITH AS MUCHDISGUST AT SUCH NONLEGAL QUIBBLING AS A MAN CAN WELL BETRAY TOWARDS AVALUABLE CLIENT
I SHOULD BE GLAD OF ANY TREATMENT THAT WOULD CURE ME WITHOUT REDUCINGME TO A SKELETON LIKE POOR GRAINGER SAID MR
 VINCY THE MAYOR AFLORID MAN WHO WOULD HAVE SERVED FOR A STUDY OF FLESH IN STRIKINGCONTRAST WITH THE FRANCISCAN TINTS OF MR
 BULSTRODE
 ITS ANUNCOMMONLY DANGEROUS THING TO BE LEFT WITHOUT ANY PADDING AGAINST THESHAFTS OF DISEASE AS SOMEBODY SAIDAND I THINK IT A VERY GOODEXPRESSION MYSELF
MR
 LYDGATE OF COURSE WAS OUT OF HEARING
 HE HAD QUITTED THE PARTYEARLY AND WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT ALTOGETHER TEDIOUS BUT FOR THE NOVELTYOF CERTAIN INTRODUCTIONS ESPECIALLY THE INTRODUCTION TO MISS BROOKEWHOSE YOUTHFUL BLOOM WITH HER APPROACHING MARRIAGE TO THAT FADEDSCHOLAR AND HER INTEREST IN MATTERS SOCIALLY USEFUL GAVE HER THEPIQUANCY OF AN UNUSUAL COMBINATION
SHE IS A GOOD CREATURETHAT FINE GIRLBUT A LITTLE TOO EARNEST HETHOUGHT
 IT IS TROUBLESOME TO TALK TO SUCH WOMEN
 THEY ARE ALWAYSWANTING REASONS YET THEY ARE TOO IGNORANT TO UNDERSTAND THE MERITS OFANY QUESTION AND USUALLY FALL BACK ON THEIR MORAL SENSE TO SETTLETHINGS AFTER THEIR OWN TASTE
EVIDENTLY MISS BROOKE WAS NOT MR
 LYDGATES STYLE OF WOMAN ANY MORETHAN MR
 CHICHELYS
 CONSIDERED INDEED IN RELATION TO THE LATTERWHOSE MIND WAS MATURED SHE WAS ALTOGETHER A MISTAKE AND CALCULATED TOSHOCK HIS TRUST IN FINAL CAUSES INCLUDING THE ADAPTATION OF FINE YOUNGWOMEN TO PURPLEFACED BACHELORS
 BUT LYDGATE WAS LESS RIPE AND MIGHTPOSSIBLY HAVE EXPERIENCE BEFORE HIM WHICH WOULD MODIFY HIS OPINION ASTO THE MOST EXCELLENT THINGS IN WOMAN
MISS BROOKE HOWEVER WAS NOT AGAIN SEEN BY EITHER OF THESE GENTLEMENUNDER HER MAIDEN NAME
 NOT LONG AFTER THAT DINNERPARTY SHE HAD BECOMEMRS
 CASAUBON AND WAS ON HER WAY TO ROME
CHAPTER XI
BUT DEEDS AND LANGUAGE SUCH AS MEN DO USEAND PERSONS SUCH AS COMEDY WOULD CHOOSEWHEN SHE WOULD SHOW AN IMAGE OF THE TIMESAND SPORT WITH HUMAN FOLLIES NOT WITH CRIMES
BEN JONSON
LYDGATE IN FACT WAS ALREADY CONSCIOUS OF BEING FASCINATED BY A WOMANSTRIKINGLY DIFFERENT FROM MISS BROOKE HE DID NOT IN THE LEAST SUPPOSETHAT HE HAD LOST HIS BALANCE AND FALLEN IN LOVE BUT HE HAD SAID OFTHAT PARTICULAR WOMAN SHE IS GRACE ITSELF SHE IS PERFECTLY LOVELYAND ACCOMPLISHED
 THAT IS WHAT A WOMAN OUGHT TO BE SHE OUGHT TOPRODUCE THE EFFECT OF EXQUISITE MUSIC
 PLAIN WOMEN HE REGARDED AS HEDID THE OTHER SEVERE FACTS OF LIFE TO BE FACED WITH PHILOSOPHY ANDINVESTIGATED BY SCIENCE
 BUT ROSAMOND VINCY SEEMED TO HAVE THE TRUEMELODIC CHARM AND WHEN A MAN HAS SEEN THE WOMAN WHOM HE WOULD HAVECHOSEN IF HE HAD INTENDED TO MARRY SPEEDILY HIS REMAINING A BACHELORWILL USUALLY DEPEND ON HER RESOLUTION RATHER THAN ON HIS
 LYDGATEBELIEVED THAT HE SHOULD NOT MARRY FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOT MARRY UNTIL HEHAD TRODDEN OUT A GOOD CLEAR PATH FOR HIMSELF AWAY FROM THE BROAD ROADWHICH WAS QUITE READY MADE
 HE HAD SEEN MISS VINCY ABOVE HIS HORIZONALMOST AS LONG AS IT HAD TAKEN MR
 CASAUBON TO BECOME ENGAGED ANDMARRIED BUT THIS LEARNED GENTLEMAN WAS POSSESSED OF A FORTUNE HE HADASSEMBLED HIS VOLUMINOUS NOTES AND HAD MADE THAT SORT OF REPUTATIONWHICH PRECEDES PERFORMANCEOFTEN THE LARGER PART OF A MANS FAME
 HETOOK A WIFE AS WE HAVE SEEN TO ADORN THE REMAINING QUADRANT OF HISCOURSE AND BE A LITTLE MOON THAT WOULD CAUSE HARDLY A CALCULABLEPERTURBATION
 BUT LYDGATE WAS YOUNG POOR AMBITIOUS
 HE HAD HISHALFCENTURY BEFORE HIM INSTEAD OF BEHIND HIM AND HE HAD COME TOMIDDLEMARCH BENT ON DOING MANY THINGS THAT WERE NOT DIRECTLY FITTED TOMAKE HIS FORTUNE OR EVEN SECURE HIM A GOOD INCOME
 TO A MAN UNDER SUCHCIRCUMSTANCES TAKING A WIFE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN A QUESTION OFADORNMENT HOWEVER HIGHLY HE MAY RATE THIS AND LYDGATE WAS DISPOSED TOGIVE IT THE FIRST PLACE AMONG WIFELY FUNCTIONS
 TO HIS TASTE GUIDED BYA SINGLE CONVERSATION HERE WAS THE POINT ON WHICH MISS BROOKE WOULD BEFOUND WANTING NOTWITHSTANDING HER UNDENIABLE BEAUTY
 SHE DID NOT LOOKAT THINGS FROM THE PROPER FEMININE ANGLE
 THE SOCIETY OF SUCH WOMEN WASABOUT AS RELAXING AS GOING FROM YOUR WORK TO TEACH THE SECOND FORMINSTEAD OF RECLINING IN A PARADISE WITH SWEET LAUGHS FOR BIRDNOTESAND BLUE EYES FOR A HEAVEN
CERTAINLY NOTHING AT PRESENT COULD SEEM MUCH LESS IMPORTANT TO LYDGATETHAN THE TURN OF MISS BROOKES MIND OR TO MISS BROOKE THAN THEQUALITIES OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD ATTRACTED THIS YOUNG SURGEON
 BUT ANYONE WATCHING KEENLY THE STEALTHY CONVERGENCE OF HUMAN LOTS SEES A SLOWPREPARATION OF EFFECTS FROM ONE LIFE ON ANOTHER WHICH TELLS LIKE ACALCULATED IRONY ON THE INDIFFERENCE OR THE FROZEN STARE WITH WHICH WELOOK AT OUR UNINTRODUCED NEIGHBOR
 DESTINY STANDS BY SARCASTIC WITH OURDRAMATIS PERSONAE FOLDED IN HER HAND
OLD PROVINCIAL SOCIETY HAD ITS SHARE OF THIS SUBTLE MOVEMENT HAD NOTONLY ITS STRIKING DOWNFALLS ITS BRILLIANT YOUNG PROFESSIONAL DANDIESWHO ENDED BY LIVING UP AN ENTRY WITH A DRAB AND SIX CHILDREN FOR THEIRESTABLISHMENT BUT ALSO THOSE LESS MARKED VICISSITUDES WHICH ARECONSTANTLY SHIFTING THE BOUNDARIES OF SOCIAL INTERCOURSE AND BEGETTINGNEW CONSCIOUSNESS OF INTERDEPENDENCE
 SOME SLIPPED A LITTLE DOWNWARDSOME GOT HIGHER FOOTING PEOPLE DENIED ASPIRATES GAINED WEALTH ANDFASTIDIOUS GENTLEMEN STOOD FOR BOROUGHS SOME WERE CAUGHT IN POLITICALCURRENTS SOME IN ECCLESIASTICAL AND PERHAPS FOUND THEMSELVESSURPRISINGLY GROUPED IN CONSEQUENCE WHILE A FEW PERSONAGES OR FAMILIESTHAT STOOD WITH ROCKY FIRMNESS AMID ALL THIS FLUCTUATION WERE SLOWLYPRESENTING NEW ASPECTS IN SPITE OF SOLIDITY AND ALTERING WITH THEDOUBLE CHANGE OF SELF AND BEHOLDER
 MUNICIPAL TOWN AND RURAL PARISHGRADUALLY MADE FRESH THREADS OF CONNECTIONGRADUALLY AS THE OLDSTOCKING GAVE WAY TO THE SAVINGSBANK AND THE WORSHIP OF THE SOLARGUINEA BECAME EXTINCT WHILE SQUIRES AND BARONETS AND EVEN LORDS WHOHAD ONCE LIVED BLAMELESSLY AFAR FROM THE CIVIC MIND GATHERED THEFAULTINESS OF CLOSER ACQUAINTANCESHIP
 SETTLERS TOO CAME FROM DISTANTCOUNTIES SOME WITH AN ALARMING NOVELTY OF SKILL OTHERS WITH ANOFFENSIVE ADVANTAGE IN CUNNING
 IN FACT MUCH THE SAME SORT OF MOVEMENTAND MIXTURE WENT ON IN OLD ENGLAND AS WE FIND IN OLDER HERODOTUS WHOALSO IN TELLING WHAT HAD BEEN THOUGHT IT WELL TO TAKE A WOMANS LOTFOR HIS STARTINGPOINT THOUGH IO AS A MAIDEN APPARENTLY BEGUILED BYATTRACTIVE MERCHANDISE WAS THE REVERSE OF MISS BROOKE AND IN THISRESPECT PERHAPS BORE MORE RESEMBLANCE TO ROSAMOND VINCY WHO HADEXCELLENT TASTE IN COSTUME WITH THAT NYMPHLIKE FIGURE AND PUREBLONDNESS WHICH GIVE THE LARGEST RANGE TO CHOICE IN THE FLOW AND COLOROF DRAPERY
 BUT THESE THINGS MADE ONLY PART OF HER CHARM
 SHE WASADMITTED TO BE THE FLOWER OF MRS
 LEMONS SCHOOL THE CHIEF SCHOOL INTHE COUNTY WHERE THE TEACHING INCLUDED ALL THAT WAS DEMANDED IN THEACCOMPLISHED FEMALEEVEN TO EXTRAS SUCH AS THE GETTING IN AND OUT OF ACARRIAGE
 MRS
 LEMON HERSELF HAD ALWAYS HELD UP MISS VINCY AS ANEXAMPLE NO PUPIL SHE SAID EXCEEDED THAT YOUNG LADY FOR MENTALACQUISITION AND PROPRIETY OF SPEECH WHILE HER MUSICAL EXECUTION WASQUITE EXCEPTIONAL
 WE CANNOT HELP THE WAY IN WHICH PEOPLE SPEAK OF USAND PROBABLY IF MRS
 LEMON HAD UNDERTAKEN TO DESCRIBE JULIET OR IMOGENTHESE HEROINES WOULD NOT HAVE SEEMED POETICAL
 THE FIRST VISION OFROSAMOND WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH WITH MOST JUDGES TO DISPEL ANYPREJUDICE EXCITED BY MRS
 LEMONS PRAISE
LYDGATE COULD NOT BE LONG IN MIDDLEMARCH WITHOUT HAVING THAT AGREEABLEVISION OR EVEN WITHOUT MAKING THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE VINCY FAMILYFOR THOUGH MR
 PEACOCK WHOSE PRACTICE HE HAD PAID SOMETHING TO ENTERON HAD NOT BEEN THEIR DOCTOR MRS
 VINCY NOT LIKING THE LOWERINGSYSTEM ADOPTED BY HIM HE HAD MANY PATIENTS AMONG THEIR CONNECTIONSAND ACQUAINTANCES
 FOR WHO OF ANY CONSEQUENCE IN MIDDLEMARCH WAS NOTCONNECTED OR AT LEAST ACQUAINTED WITH THE VINCYS
 THEY WERE OLDMANUFACTURERS AND HAD KEPT A GOOD HOUSE FOR THREE GENERATIONS INWHICH THERE HAD NATURALLY BEEN MUCH INTERMARRYING WITH NEIGHBORS MOREOR LESS DECIDEDLY GENTEEL
 MR
 VINCYS SISTER HAD MADE A WEALTHY MATCHIN ACCEPTING MR
 BULSTRODE WHO HOWEVER AS A MAN NOT BORN IN THETOWN AND ALTOGETHER OF DIMLY KNOWN ORIGIN WAS CONSIDERED TO HAVE DONEWELL IN UNITING HIMSELF WITH A REAL MIDDLEMARCH FAMILY ON THE OTHERHAND MR
 VINCY HAD DESCENDED A LITTLE HAVING TAKEN AN INNKEEPERSDAUGHTER
 BUT ON THIS SIDE TOO THERE WAS A CHEERING SENSE OF MONEY FORMRS
 VINCYS SISTER HAD BEEN SECOND WIFE TO RICH OLD MR
 FEATHERSTONEAND HAD DIED CHILDLESS YEARS AGO SO THAT HER NEPHEWS AND NIECES MIGHTBE SUPPOSED TO TOUCH THE AFFECTIONS OF THE WIDOWER
 AND IT HAPPENEDTHAT MR
 BULSTRODE AND MR
 FEATHERSTONE TWO OF PEACOCKS MOSTIMPORTANT PATIENTS HAD FROM DIFFERENT CAUSES GIVEN AN ESPECIALLYGOOD RECEPTION TO HIS SUCCESSOR WHO HAD RAISED SOME PARTISANSHIP ASWELL AS DISCUSSION
 MR
 WRENCH MEDICAL ATTENDANT TO THE VINCY FAMILYVERY EARLY HAD GROUNDS FOR THINKING LIGHTLY OF LYDGATES PROFESSIONALDISCRETION AND THERE WAS NO REPORT ABOUT HIM WHICH WAS NOT RETAILED ATTHE VINCYS WHERE VISITORS WERE FREQUENT
 MR
 VINCY WAS MORE INCLINEDTO GENERAL GOODFELLOWSHIP THAN TO TAKING SIDES BUT THERE WAS NO NEEDFOR HIM TO BE HASTY IN MAKING ANY NEW MAN ACQUAINTANCE
 ROSAMONDSILENTLY WISHED THAT HER FATHER WOULD INVITE MR
 LYDGATE
 SHE WAS TIREDOF THE FACES AND FIGURES SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN USED TOTHE VARIOUSIRREGULAR PROFILES AND GAITS AND TURNS OF PHRASE DISTINGUISHING THOSEMIDDLEMARCH YOUNG MEN WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN AS BOYS
 SHE HAD BEEN ATSCHOOL WITH GIRLS OF HIGHER POSITION WHOSE BROTHERS SHE FELT SURE ITWOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE FOR HER TO BE MORE INTERESTED IN THAN INTHESE INEVITABLE MIDDLEMARCH COMPANIONS
 BUT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE CHOSENTO MENTION HER WISH TO HER FATHER AND HE FOR HIS PART WAS IN NOHURRY ON THE SUBJECT
 AN ALDERMAN ABOUT TO BE MAYOR MUST BYANDBYENLARGE HIS DINNERPARTIES BUT AT PRESENT THERE WERE PLENTY OF GUESTSAT HIS WELLSPREAD TABLE
THAT TABLE OFTEN REMAINED COVERED WITH THE RELICS OF THE FAMILYBREAKFAST LONG AFTER MR
 VINCY HAD GONE WITH HIS SECOND SON TO THEWAREHOUSE AND WHEN MISS MORGAN WAS ALREADY FAR ON IN MORNING LESSONSWITH THE YOUNGER GIRLS IN THE SCHOOLROOM
 IT AWAITED THE FAMILYLAGGARD WHO FOUND ANY SORT OF INCONVENIENCE TO OTHERS LESSDISAGREEABLE THAN GETTING UP WHEN HE WAS CALLED
 THIS WAS THE CASE ONEMORNING OF THE OCTOBER IN WHICH WE HAVE LATELY SEEN MR
 CASAUBONVISITING THE GRANGE AND THOUGH THE ROOM WAS A LITTLE OVERHEATED WITHTHE FIRE WHICH HAD SENT THE SPANIEL PANTING TO A REMOTE CORNERROSAMOND FOR SOME REASON CONTINUED TO SIT AT HER EMBROIDERY LONGERTHAN USUAL NOW AND THEN GIVING HERSELF A LITTLE SHAKE AND LAYING HERWORK ON HER KNEE TO CONTEMPLATE IT WITH AN AIR OF HESITATING WEARINESS
HER MAMMA WHO HAD RETURNED FROM AN EXCURSION TO THE KITCHEN SAT ONTHE OTHER SIDE OF THE SMALL WORKTABLE WITH AN AIR OF MORE ENTIREPLACIDITY UNTIL THE CLOCK AGAIN GIVING NOTICE THAT IT WAS GOING TOSTRIKE SHE LOOKED UP FROM THE LACEMENDING WHICH WAS OCCUPYING HERPLUMP FINGERS AND RANG THE BELL
KNOCK AT MR
 FREDS DOOR AGAIN PRITCHARD AND TELL HIM IT HAS STRUCKHALFPAST TEN
THIS WAS SAID WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN THE RADIANT GOODHUMOR OF MRS
VINCYS FACE IN WHICH FORTYFIVE YEARS HAD DELVED NEITHER ANGLES NORPARALLELS AND PUSHING BACK HER PINK CAPSTRINGS SHE LET HER WORK RESTON HER LAP WHILE SHE LOOKED ADMIRINGLY AT HER DAUGHTER
MAMMA SAID ROSAMOND WHEN FRED COMES DOWN I WISH YOU WOULD NOT LETHIM HAVE RED HERRINGS
 I CANNOT BEAR THE SMELL OF THEM ALL OVER THEHOUSE AT THIS HOUR OF THE MORNING
OH MY DEAR YOU ARE SO HARD ON YOUR BROTHERS
 IT IS THE ONLY FAULT IHAVE TO FIND WITH YOU
 YOU ARE THE SWEETEST TEMPER IN THE WORLD BUTYOU ARE SO TETCHY WITH YOUR BROTHERS
NOT TETCHY MAMMA YOU NEVER HEAR ME SPEAK IN AN UNLADYLIKE WAY
WELL BUT YOU WANT TO DENY THEM THINGS
BROTHERS ARE SO UNPLEASANT
OH MY DEAR YOU MUST ALLOW FOR YOUNG MEN
 BE THANKFUL IF THEY HAVEGOOD HEARTS
 A WOMAN MUST LEARN TO PUT UP WITH LITTLE THINGS
 YOU WILLBE MARRIED SOME DAY
NOT TO ANY ONE WHO IS LIKE FRED
DONT DECRY YOUR OWN BROTHER MY DEAR
 FEW YOUNG MEN HAVE LESS AGAINSTTHEM ALTHOUGH HE COULDNT TAKE HIS DEGREEIM SURE I CANT UNDERSTANDWHY FOR HE SEEMS TO ME MOST CLEVER
 AND YOU KNOW YOURSELF HE WASTHOUGHT EQUAL TO THE BEST SOCIETY AT COLLEGE
 SO PARTICULAR AS YOU AREMY DEAR I WONDER YOU ARE NOT GLAD TO HAVE SUCH A GENTLEMANLY YOUNG MANFOR A BROTHER
 YOU ARE ALWAYS FINDING FAULT WITH BOB BECAUSE HE IS NOTFRED
OH NO MAMMA ONLY BECAUSE HE IS BOB
WELL MY DEAR YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY MIDDLEMARCH YOUNG MAN WHO HAS NOTSOMETHING AGAINST HIM
BUTHERE ROSAMONDS FACE BROKE INTO A SMILE WHICH SUDDENLY REVEALEDTWO DIMPLES
 SHE HERSELF THOUGHT UNFAVORABLY OF THESE DIMPLES ANDSMILED LITTLE IN GENERAL SOCIETY
 BUT I SHALL NOT MARRY ANYMIDDLEMARCH YOUNG MAN
SO IT SEEMS MY LOVE FOR YOU HAVE AS GOOD AS REFUSED THE PICK OFTHEM AND IF THERES BETTER TO BE HAD IM SURE THERES NO GIRL BETTERDESERVES IT
EXCUSE ME MAMMAI WISH YOU WOULD NOT SAY THE PICK OF THEM
WHY WHAT ELSE ARE THEY
I MEAN MAMMA IT IS RATHER A VULGAR EXPRESSION
VERY LIKELY MY DEAR I NEVER WAS A GOOD SPEAKER
 WHAT SHOULD I SAY
THE BEST OF THEM
WHY THAT SEEMS JUST AS PLAIN AND COMMON
 IF I HAD HAD TIME TO THINKI SHOULD HAVE SAID THE MOST SUPERIOR YOUNG MEN
 BUT WITH YOUREDUCATION YOU MUST KNOW
WHAT MUST ROSY KNOW MOTHER
 SAID MR
 FRED WHO HAD SLID INUNOBSERVED THROUGH THE HALFOPEN DOOR WHILE THE LADIES WERE BENDINGOVER THEIR WORK AND NOW GOING UP TO THE FIRE STOOD WITH HIS BACKTOWARDS IT WARMING THE SOLES OF HIS SLIPPERS
WHETHER ITS RIGHT TO SAY SUPERIOR YOUNG MEN SAID MRS
 VINCYRINGING THE BELL
OH THERE ARE SO MANY SUPERIOR TEAS AND SUGARS NOW
 SUPERIOR ISGETTING TO BE SHOPKEEPERS SLANG
ARE YOU BEGINNING TO DISLIKE SLANG THEN
 SAID ROSAMOND WITH MILDGRAVITY
ONLY THE WRONG SORT
 ALL CHOICE OF WORDS IS SLANG
 IT MARKS A CLASS
THERE IS CORRECT ENGLISH THAT IS NOT SLANG
I BEG YOUR PARDON CORRECT ENGLISH IS THE SLANG OF PRIGS WHO WRITEHISTORY AND ESSAYS
 AND THE STRONGEST SLANG OF ALL IS THE SLANG OFPOETS
YOU WILL SAY ANYTHING FRED TO GAIN YOUR POINT
WELL TELL ME WHETHER IT IS SLANG OR POETRY TO CALL AN OX ALEGPLAITER
OF COURSE YOU CAN CALL IT POETRY IF YOU LIKE
AHA MISS ROSY YOU DONT KNOW HOMER FROM SLANG
 I SHALL INVENT A NEWGAME I SHALL WRITE BITS OF SLANG AND POETRY ON SLIPS AND GIVE THEM TOYOU TO SEPARATE
DEAR ME HOW AMUSING IT IS TO HEAR YOUNG PEOPLE TALK
 SAID MRS
VINCY WITH CHEERFUL ADMIRATION
HAVE YOU GOT NOTHING ELSE FOR MY BREAKFAST PRITCHARD
 SAID FRED TOTHE SERVANT WHO BROUGHT IN COFFEE AND BUTTERED TOAST WHILE HE WALKEDROUND THE TABLE SURVEYING THE HAM POTTED BEEF AND OTHER COLDREMNANTS WITH AN AIR OF SILENT REJECTION AND POLITE FORBEARANCE FROMSIGNS OF DISGUST
SHOULD YOU LIKE EGGS SIR
EGGS NO
 BRING ME A GRILLED BONE
REALLY FRED SAID ROSAMOND WHEN THE SERVANT HAD LEFT THE ROOM IFYOU MUST HAVE HOT THINGS FOR BREAKFAST I WISH YOU WOULD COME DOWNEARLIER
 YOU CAN GET UP AT SIX OCLOCK TO GO OUT HUNTING I CANNOTUNDERSTAND WHY YOU FIND IT SO DIFFICULT TO GET UP ON OTHER MORNINGS
THAT IS YOUR WANT OF UNDERSTANDING ROSY
 I CAN GET UP TO GO HUNTINGBECAUSE I LIKE IT
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF ME IF I CAME DOWN TWO HOURS AFTER EVERY ONEELSE AND ORDERED GRILLED BONE
I SHOULD THINK YOU WERE AN UNCOMMONLY FAST YOUNG LADY SAID FREDEATING HIS TOAST WITH THE UTMOST COMPOSURE
I CANNOT SEE WHY BROTHERS ARE TO MAKE THEMSELVES DISAGREEABLE ANYMORE THAN SISTERS
I DONT MAKE MYSELF DISAGREEABLE IT IS YOU WHO FIND ME SO
DISAGREEABLE IS A WORD THAT DESCRIBES YOUR FEELINGS AND NOT MYACTIONS
I THINK IT DESCRIBES THE SMELL OF GRILLED BONE
NOT AT ALL
 IT DESCRIBES A SENSATION IN YOUR LITTLE NOSE ASSOCIATEDWITH CERTAIN FINICKING NOTIONS WHICH ARE THE CLASSICS OF MRS
 LEMONSSCHOOL
 LOOK AT MY MOTHER YOU DONT SEE HER OBJECTING TO EVERYTHINGEXCEPT WHAT SHE DOES HERSELF
 SHE IS MY NOTION OF A PLEASANT WOMAN
BLESS YOU BOTH MY DEARS AND DONT QUARREL SAID MRS
 VINCY WITHMOTHERLY CORDIALITY
 COME FRED TELL US ALL ABOUT THE NEW DOCTOR
 HOWIS YOUR UNCLE PLEASED WITH HIM
PRETTY WELL I THINK
 HE ASKS LYDGATE ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS AND THENSCREWS UP HIS FACE WHILE HE HEARS THE ANSWERS AS IF THEY WERE PINCHINGHIS TOES
 THATS HIS WAY
 AH HERE COMES MY GRILLED BONE
BUT HOW CAME YOU TO STAY OUT SO LATE MY DEAR
 YOU ONLY SAID YOU WEREGOING TO YOUR UNCLES
OH I DINED AT PLYMDALES
 WE HAD WHIST
 LYDGATE WAS THERE TOO
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM
 HE IS VERY GENTLEMANLY I SUPPOSE
 THEYSAY HE IS OF EXCELLENT FAMILYHIS RELATIONS QUITE COUNTY PEOPLE
YES SAID FRED
 THERE WAS A LYDGATE AT JOHNS WHO SPENT NO END OFMONEY
 I FIND THIS MAN IS A SECOND COUSIN OF HIS
 BUT RICH MEN MAY HAVEVERY POOR DEVILS FOR SECOND COUSINS
IT ALWAYS MAKES A DIFFERENCE THOUGH TO BE OF GOOD FAMILY SAIDROSAMOND WITH A TONE OF DECISION WHICH SHOWED THAT SHE HAD THOUGHT ONTHIS SUBJECT
 ROSAMOND FELT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HAPPIER IF SHE HADNOT BEEN THE DAUGHTER OF A MIDDLEMARCH MANUFACTURER
 SHE DISLIKEDANYTHING WHICH REMINDED HER THAT HER MOTHERS FATHER HAD BEEN ANINNKEEPER
 CERTAINLY ANY ONE REMEMBERING THE FACT MIGHT THINK THAT MRS
VINCY HAD THE AIR OF A VERY HANDSOME GOODHUMORED LANDLADY ACCUSTOMEDTO THE MOST CAPRICIOUS ORDERS OF GENTLEMEN
I THOUGHT IT WAS ODD HIS NAME WAS TERTIUS SAID THE BRIGHTFACEDMATRON BUT OF COURSE ITS A NAME IN THE FAMILY
 BUT NOW TELL USEXACTLY WHAT SORT OF MAN HE IS
OH TALLISH DARK CLEVERTALKS WELLRATHER A PRIG I THINK
I NEVER CAN MAKE OUT WHAT YOU MEAN BY A PRIG SAID ROSAMOND
A FELLOW WHO WANTS TO SHOW THAT HE HAS OPINIONS
WHY MY DEAR DOCTORS MUST HAVE OPINIONS SAID MRS
 VINCY
 WHAT ARETHEY THERE FOR ELSE
YES MOTHER THE OPINIONS THEY ARE PAID FOR
 BUT A PRIG IS A FELLOWWHO IS ALWAYS MAKING YOU A PRESENT OF HIS OPINIONS
I SUPPOSE MARY GARTH ADMIRES MR
 LYDGATE SAID ROSAMOND NOT WITHOUTA TOUCH OF INNUENDO
REALLY I CANT SAY
 SAID FRED RATHER GLUMLY AS HE LEFT THE TABLEAND TAKING UP A NOVEL WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT DOWN WITH HIM THREW HIMSELFINTO AN ARMCHAIR
 IF YOU ARE JEALOUS OF HER GO OFTENER TO STONECOURT YOURSELF AND ECLIPSE HER
I WISH YOU WOULD NOT BE SO VULGAR FRED
 IF YOU HAVE FINISHED PRAYRING THE BELL
IT IS TRUE THOUGHWHAT YOUR BROTHER SAYS ROSAMOND MRS
 VINCYBEGAN WHEN THE SERVANT HAD CLEARED THE TABLE
 IT IS A THOUSAND PITIESYOU HAVENT PATIENCE TO GO AND SEE YOUR UNCLE MORE SO PROUD OF YOU ASHE IS AND WANTED YOU TO LIVE WITH HIM
 THERES NO KNOWING WHAT HEMIGHT HAVE DONE FOR YOU AS WELL AS FOR FRED
 GOD KNOWS IM FOND OFHAVING YOU AT HOME WITH ME BUT I CAN PART WITH MY CHILDREN FOR THEIRGOOD
 AND NOW IT STANDS TO REASON THAT YOUR UNCLE FEATHERSTONE WILL DOSOMETHING FOR MARY GARTH
MARY GARTH CAN BEAR BEING AT STONE COURT BECAUSE SHE LIKES THATBETTER THAN BEING A GOVERNESS SAID ROSAMOND FOLDING UP HER WORK
 IWOULD RATHER NOT HAVE ANYTHING LEFT TO ME IF I MUST EARN IT BY ENDURINGMUCH OF MY UNCLES COUGH AND HIS UGLY RELATIONS
HE CANT BE LONG FOR THIS WORLD MY DEAR I WOULDNT HASTEN HIS ENDBUT WHAT WITH ASTHMA AND THAT INWARD COMPLAINT LET US HOPE THERE ISSOMETHING BETTER FOR HIM IN ANOTHER
 AND I HAVE NO ILLWILL TOWARDSMARY GARTH BUT THERES JUSTICE TO BE THOUGHT OF
 AND MR
FEATHERSTONES FIRST WIFE BROUGHT HIM NO MONEY AS MY SISTER DID
 HERNIECES AND NEPHEWS CANT HAVE SO MUCH CLAIM AS MY SISTERS
 AND I MUSTSAY I THINK MARY GARTH A DREADFUL PLAIN GIRLMORE FIT FOR A GOVERNESS
EVERY ONE WOULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU THERE MOTHER SAID FRED WHOSEEMED TO BE ABLE TO READ AND LISTEN TOO
WELL MY DEAR SAID MRS
 VINCY WHEELING SKILFULLY IF SHE HADSOME FORTUNE LEFT HERA MAN MARRIES HIS WIFES RELATIONS AND THEGARTHS ARE SO POOR AND LIVE IN SUCH A SMALL WAY
 BUT I SHALL LEAVE YOUTO YOUR STUDIES MY DEAR FOR I MUST GO AND DO SOME SHOPPING
FREDS STUDIES ARE NOT VERY DEEP SAID ROSAMOND RISING WITH HERMAMMA HE IS ONLY READING A NOVEL
WELL WELL BYANDBY HELL GO TO HIS LATIN AND THINGS SAID MRS
VINCY SOOTHINGLY STROKING HER SONS HEAD
 THERES A FIRE IN THESMOKINGROOM ON PURPOSE
 ITS YOUR FATHERS WISH YOU KNOWFRED MYDEARAND I ALWAYS TELL HIM YOU WILL BE GOOD AND GO TO COLLEGE AGAIN TOTAKE YOUR DEGREE
FRED DREW HIS MOTHERS HAND DOWN TO HIS LIPS BUT SAID NOTHING
I SUPPOSE YOU ARE NOT GOING OUT RIDING TODAY
 SAID ROSAMONDLINGERING A LITTLE AFTER HER MAMMA WAS GONE
NO WHY
PAPA SAYS I MAY HAVE THE CHESTNUT TO RIDE NOW
YOU CAN GO WITH ME TOMORROW IF YOU LIKE
 ONLY I AM GOING TO STONECOURT REMEMBER
I WANT TO RIDE SO MUCH IT IS INDIFFERENT TO ME WHERE WE GO
 ROSAMONDREALLY WISHED TO GO TO STONE COURT OF ALL OTHER PLACES
OH I SAY ROSY SAID FRED AS SHE WAS PASSING OUT OF THE ROOM IFYOU ARE GOING TO THE PIANO LET ME COME AND PLAY SOME AIRS WITH YOU
PRAY DO NOT ASK ME THIS MORNING
WHY NOT THIS MORNING
REALLY FRED I WISH YOU WOULD LEAVE OFF PLAYING THE FLUTE
 A MANLOOKS VERY SILLY PLAYING THE FLUTE
 AND YOU PLAY SO OUT OF TUNE
WHEN NEXT ANY ONE MAKES LOVE TO YOU MISS ROSAMOND I WILL TELL HIMHOW OBLIGING YOU ARE
WHY SHOULD YOU EXPECT ME TO OBLIGE YOU BY HEARING YOU PLAY THE FLUTEANY MORE THAN I SHOULD EXPECT YOU TO OBLIGE ME BY NOT PLAYING IT
AND WHY SHOULD YOU EXPECT ME TO TAKE YOU OUT RIDING
THIS QUESTION LED TO AN ADJUSTMENT FOR ROSAMOND HAD SET HER MIND ONTHAT PARTICULAR RIDE
SO FRED WAS GRATIFIED WITH NEARLY AN HOURS PRACTICE OF AR HYD Y NOSYE BANKS AND BRAES AND OTHER FAVORITE AIRS FROM HIS INSTRUCTOR ONTHE FLUTE A WHEEZY PERFORMANCE INTO WHICH HE THREW MUCH AMBITION ANDAN IRREPRESSIBLE HOPEFULNESS
CHAPTER XII
HE HAD MORE TOW ON HIS DISTAFFETHAN GERVEIS KNEW
CHAUCER
THE RIDE TO STONE COURT WHICH FRED AND ROSAMOND TOOK THE NEXT MORNINGLAY THROUGH A PRETTY BIT OF MIDLAND LANDSCAPE ALMOST ALL MEADOWS ANDPASTURES WITH HEDGEROWS STILL ALLOWED TO GROW IN BUSHY BEAUTY AND TOSPREAD OUT CORAL FRUIT FOR THE BIRDS
 LITTLE DETAILS GAVE EACH FIELD APARTICULAR PHYSIOGNOMY DEAR TO THE EYES THAT HAVE LOOKED ON THEM FROMCHILDHOOD THE POOL IN THE CORNER WHERE THE GRASSES WERE DANK AND TREESLEANED WHISPERINGLY THE GREAT OAK SHADOWING A BARE PLACE INMIDPASTURE THE HIGH BANK WHERE THE ASHTREES GREW THE SUDDEN SLOPEOF THE OLD MARLPIT MAKING A RED BACKGROUND FOR THE BURDOCK THEHUDDLED ROOFS AND RICKS OF THE HOMESTEAD WITHOUT A TRACEABLE WAY OFAPPROACH THE GRAY GATE AND FENCES AGAINST THE DEPTHS OF THE BORDERINGWOOD AND THE STRAY HOVEL ITS OLD OLD THATCH FULL OF MOSSY HILLS ANDVALLEYS WITH WONDROUS MODULATIONS OF LIGHT AND SHADOW SUCH AS WE TRAVELFAR TO SEE IN LATER LIFE AND SEE LARGER BUT NOT MORE BEAUTIFUL
 THESEARE THE THINGS THAT MAKE THE GAMUT OF JOY IN LANDSCAPE TO MIDLANDBREDSOULSTHE THINGS THEY TODDLED AMONG OR PERHAPS LEARNED BY HEARTSTANDING BETWEEN THEIR FATHERS KNEES WHILE HE DROVE LEISURELY
BUT THE ROAD EVEN THE BYROAD WAS EXCELLENT FOR LOWICK AS WE HAVESEEN WAS NOT A PARISH OF MUDDY LANES AND POOR TENANTS AND IT WAS INTOLOWICK PARISH THAT FRED AND ROSAMOND ENTERED AFTER A COUPLE OF MILESRIDING
 ANOTHER MILE WOULD BRING THEM TO STONE COURT AND AT THE END OFTHE FIRST HALF THE HOUSE WAS ALREADY VISIBLE LOOKING AS IF IT HADBEEN ARRESTED IN ITS GROWTH TOWARD A STONE MANSION BY AN UNEXPECTEDBUDDING OF FARMBUILDINGS ON ITS LEFT FLANK WHICH HAD HINDERED IT FROMBECOMING ANYTHING MORE THAN THE SUBSTANTIAL DWELLING OF A GENTLEMANFARMER
 IT WAS NOT THE LESS AGREEABLE AN OBJECT IN THE DISTANCE FOR THECLUSTER OF PINNACLED CORNRICKS WHICH BALANCED THE FINE ROW OF WALNUTSON THE RIGHT
PRESENTLY IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DISCERN SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE A GIG ONTHE CIRCULAR DRIVE BEFORE THE FRONT DOOR
DEAR ME SAID ROSAMOND I HOPE NONE OF MY UNCLES HORRIBLE RELATIONSARE THERE
THEY ARE THOUGH
 THAT IS MRS
 WAULES GIGTHE LAST YELLOW GIG LEFT ISHOULD THINK
 WHEN I SEE MRS
 WAULE IN IT I UNDERSTAND HOW YELLOW CANHAVE BEEN WORN FOR MOURNING
 THAT GIG SEEMS TO ME MORE FUNEREAL THAN AHEARSE
 BUT THEN MRS
 WAULE ALWAYS HAS BLACK CRAPE ON
 HOW DOES SHEMANAGE IT ROSY
 HER FRIENDS CANT ALWAYS BE DYING
I DONT KNOW AT ALL
 AND SHE IS NOT IN THE LEAST EVANGELICAL SAIDROSAMOND REFLECTIVELY AS IF THAT RELIGIOUS POINT OF VIEW WOULD HAVEFULLY ACCOUNTED FOR PERPETUAL CRAPE
 AND NOT POOR SHE ADDED AFTERA MOMENTS PAUSE
NO BY GEORGE
 THEY ARE AS RICH AS JEWS THOSE WAULES ANDFEATHERSTONES I MEAN FOR PEOPLE LIKE THEM WHO DONT WANT TO SPENDANYTHING
 AND YET THEY HANG ABOUT MY UNCLE LIKE VULTURES AND AREAFRAID OF A FARTHING GOING AWAY FROM THEIR SIDE OF THE FAMILY
 BUT IBELIEVE HE HATES THEM ALL
THE MRS
 WAULE WHO WAS SO FAR FROM BEING ADMIRABLE IN THE EYES OF THESEDISTANT CONNECTIONS HAD HAPPENED TO SAY THIS VERY MORNING NOT AT ALLWITH A DEFIANT AIR BUT IN A LOW MUFFLED NEUTRAL TONE AS OF A VOICEHEARD THROUGH COTTON WOOL THAT SHE DID NOT WISH TO ENJOY THEIR GOODOPINION
 SHE WAS SEATED AS SHE OBSERVED ON HER OWN BROTHERS HEARTHAND HAD BEEN JANE FEATHERSTONE FIVEANDTWENTY YEARS BEFORE SHE HADBEEN JANE WAULE WHICH ENTITLED HER TO SPEAK WHEN HER OWN BROTHERSNAME HAD BEEN MADE FREE WITH BY THOSE WHO HAD NO RIGHT TO IT
WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT THERE
 SAID MR
 FEATHERSTONE HOLDING HISSTICK BETWEEN HIS KNEES AND SETTLING HIS WIG WHILE HE GAVE HER AMOMENTARY SHARP GLANCE WHICH SEEMED TO REACT ON HIM LIKE A DRAUGHT OFCOLD AIR AND SET HIM COUGHING
MRS
 WAULE HAD TO DEFER HER ANSWER TILL HE WAS QUIET AGAIN TILL MARYGARTH HAD SUPPLIED HIM WITH FRESH SYRUP AND HE HAD BEGUN TO RUB THEGOLD KNOB OF HIS STICK LOOKING BITTERLY AT THE FIRE
 IT WAS A BRIGHTFIRE BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THE CHILLLOOKING PURPLISH TINT OFMRS
 WAULES FACE WHICH WAS AS NEUTRAL AS HER VOICE HAVING MERECHINKS FOR EYES AND LIPS THAT HARDLY MOVED IN SPEAKING
THE DOCTORS CANT MASTER THAT COUGH BROTHER
 ITS JUST LIKE WHAT IHAVE FOR IM YOUR OWN SISTER CONSTITUTION AND EVERYTHING
 BUT AS IWAS SAYING ITS A PITY MRS
 VINCYS FAMILY CANT BE BETTER CONDUCTED
TCHAH
 YOU SAID NOTHING O THE SORT
 YOU SAID SOMEBODY HAD MADE FREEWITH MY NAME
AND NO MORE THAN CAN BE PROVED IF WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS IS TRUE
 MYBROTHER SOLOMON TELLS ME ITS THE TALK UP AND DOWN IN MIDDLEMARCH HOWUNSTEADY YOUNG VINCY IS AND HAS BEEN FOREVER GAMBLING AT BILLIARDSSINCE HOME HE CAME
NONSENSE
 WHATS A GAME AT BILLIARDS
 ITS A GOOD GENTLEMANLY GAMEAND YOUNG VINCY IS NOT A CLODHOPPER
 IF YOUR SON JOHN TOOK TOBILLIARDS NOW HED MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF
YOUR NEPHEW JOHN NEVER TOOK TO BILLIARDS OR ANY OTHER GAME BROTHERAND IS FAR FROM LOSING HUNDREDS OF POUNDS WHICH IF WHAT EVERYBODYSAYS IS TRUE MUST BE FOUND SOMEWHERE ELSE THAN OUT OF MR
 VINCY THEFATHERS POCKET
 FOR THEY SAY HES BEEN LOSING MONEY FOR YEARS THOUGHNOBODY WOULD THINK SO TO SEE HIM GO COURSING AND KEEPING OPEN HOUSE ASTHEY DO
 AND IVE HEARD SAY MR
 BULSTRODE CONDEMNS MRS
 VINCY BEYONDANYTHING FOR HER FLIGHTINESS AND SPOILING HER CHILDREN SO
WHATS BULSTRODE TO ME
 I DONT BANK WITH HIM
WELL MRS
 BULSTRODE IS MR
 VINCYS OWN SISTER AND THEY DO SAY THATMR
 VINCY MOSTLY TRADES ON THE BANK MONEY AND YOU MAY SEE YOURSELFBROTHER WHEN A WOMAN PAST FORTY HAS PINK STRINGS ALWAYS FLYING ANDTHAT LIGHT WAY OF LAUGHING AT EVERYTHING ITS VERY UNBECOMING
 BUTINDULGING YOUR CHILDREN IS ONE THING AND FINDING MONEY TO PAY THEIRDEBTS IS ANOTHER
 AND ITS OPENLY SAID THAT YOUNG VINCY HAS RAISEDMONEY ON HIS EXPECTATIONS
 I DONT SAY WHAT EXPECTATIONS
 MISS GARTHHEARS ME AND IS WELCOME TO TELL AGAIN
 I KNOW YOUNG PEOPLE HANGTOGETHER
NO THANK YOU MRS
 WAULE SAID MARY GARTH
 I DISLIKE HEARINGSCANDAL TOO MUCH TO WISH TO REPEAT IT
MR
 FEATHERSTONE RUBBED THE KNOB OF HIS STICK AND MADE A BRIEFCONVULSIVE SHOW OF LAUGHTER WHICH HAD MUCH THE SAME GENUINENESS AS ANOLD WHISTPLAYERS CHUCKLE OVER A BAD HAND
 STILL LOOKING AT THE FIREHE SAIDAND WHO PRETENDS TO SAY FRED VINCY HASNT GOT EXPECTATIONS
 SUCH AFINE SPIRITED FELLOW IS LIKE ENOUGH TO HAVE EM
THERE WAS A SLIGHT PAUSE BEFORE MRS
 WAULE REPLIED AND WHEN SHE DIDSO HER VOICE SEEMED TO BE SLIGHTLY MOISTENED WITH TEARS THOUGH HERFACE WAS STILL DRY
WHETHER OR NO BROTHER IT IS NATURALLY PAINFUL TO ME AND MY BROTHERSOLOMON TO HEAR YOUR NAME MADE FREE WITH AND YOUR COMPLAINT BEING SUCHAS MAY CARRY YOU OFF SUDDEN AND PEOPLE WHO ARE NO MORE FEATHERSTONESTHAN THE MERRYANDREW AT THE FAIR OPENLY RECKONING ON YOUR PROPERTYCOMING TO THEM
 AND ME YOUR OWN SISTER AND SOLOMON YOUR OWN BROTHER
AND IF THATS TO BE IT WHAT HAS IT PLEASED THE ALMIGHTY TO MAKEFAMILIES FOR
 HERE MRS
 WAULES TEARS FELL BUT WITH MODERATION
COME OUT WITH IT JANE
 SAID MR
 FEATHERSTONE LOOKING AT HER
 YOUMEAN TO SAY FRED VINCY HAS BEEN GETTING SOMEBODY TO ADVANCE HIM MONEYON WHAT HE SAYS HE KNOWS ABOUT MY WILL EH
I NEVER SAID SO BROTHER MRS
 WAULES VOICE HAD AGAIN BECOME DRY ANDUNSHAKEN
 IT WAS TOLD ME BY MY BROTHER SOLOMON LAST NIGHT WHEN HECALLED COMING FROM MARKET TO GIVE ME ADVICE ABOUT THE OLD WHEAT MEBEING A WIDOW AND MY SON JOHN ONLY THREEANDTWENTY THOUGH STEADYBEYOND ANYTHING
 AND HE HAD IT FROM MOST UNDENIABLE AUTHORITY AND NOTONE BUT MANY
STUFF AND NONSENSE
 I DONT BELIEVE A WORD OF IT
 ITS ALL A GOTUPSTORY
 GO TO THE WINDOW MISSY I THOUGHT I HEARD A HORSE
 SEE IF THEDOCTORS COMING
NOT GOT UP BY ME BROTHER NOR YET BY SOLOMON WHO WHATEVER ELSE HEMAY BEAND I DONT DENY HE HAS ODDITIESHAS MADE HIS WILL AND PARTEDHIS PROPERTY EQUAL BETWEEN SUCH KIN AS HES FRIENDS WITH THOUGH FORMY PART I THINK THERE ARE TIMES WHEN SOME SHOULD BE CONSIDERED MORETHAN OTHERS
 BUT SOLOMON MAKES IT NO SECRET WHAT HE MEANS TO DO
THE MORE FOOL HE
 SAID MR
 FEATHERSTONE WITH SOME DIFFICULTYBREAKING INTO A SEVERE FIT OF COUGHING THAT REQUIRED MARY GARTH TOSTAND NEAR HIM SO THAT SHE DID NOT FIND OUT WHOSE HORSES THEY WEREWHICH PRESENTLY PAUSED STAMPING ON THE GRAVEL BEFORE THE DOOR
BEFORE MR
 FEATHERSTONES COUGH WAS QUIET ROSAMOND ENTERED BEARING UPHER RIDINGHABIT WITH MUCH GRACE
 SHE BOWED CEREMONIOUSLY TO MRS
WAULE WHO SAID STIFFLY HOW DO YOU DO MISS
 SMILED AND NODDEDSILENTLY TO MARY AND REMAINED STANDING TILL THE COUGHING SHOULD CEASEAND ALLOW HER UNCLE TO NOTICE HER
HEYDAY MISS
 HE SAID AT LAST YOU HAVE A FINE COLOR
 WHERES FRED
SEEING ABOUT THE HORSES
 HE WILL BE IN PRESENTLY
SIT DOWN SIT DOWN
 MRS
 WAULE YOUD BETTER GO
EVEN THOSE NEIGHBORS WHO HAD CALLED PETER FEATHERSTONE AN OLD FOX HADNEVER ACCUSED HIM OF BEING INSINCERELY POLITE AND HIS SISTER WAS QUITEUSED TO THE PECULIAR ABSENCE OF CEREMONY WITH WHICH HE MARKED HIS SENSEOF BLOODRELATIONSHIP
 INDEED SHE HERSELF WAS ACCUSTOMED TO THINK THATENTIRE FREEDOM FROM THE NECESSITY OF BEHAVING AGREEABLY WAS INCLUDED INTHE ALMIGHTYS INTENTIONS ABOUT FAMILIES
 SHE ROSE SLOWLY WITHOUT ANYSIGN OF RESENTMENT AND SAID IN HER USUAL MUFFLED MONOTONE BROTHER IHOPE THE NEW DOCTOR WILL BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU
 SOLOMON SAYSTHERES GREAT TALK OF HIS CLEVERNESS
 IM SURE ITS MY WISH YOU SHOULDBE SPARED
 AND THERES NONE MORE READY TO NURSE YOU THAN YOUR OWNSISTER AND YOUR OWN NIECES IF YOUD ONLY SAY THE WORD
 THERESREBECCA AND JOANNA AND ELIZABETH YOU KNOW
AY AY I REMEMBERYOULL SEE IVE REMEMBERED EM ALLALL DARK ANDUGLY
 THEYD NEED HAVE SOME MONEY EH
 THERE NEVER WAS ANY BEAUTY INTHE WOMEN OF OUR FAMILY BUT THE FEATHERSTONES HAVE ALWAYS HAD SOMEMONEY AND THE WAULES TOO
 WAULE HAD MONEY TOO
 A WARM MAN WAS WAULE
AY AY MONEYS A GOOD EGG AND IF YOUVE GOT MONEY TO LEAVE BEHINDYOU LAY IT IN A WARM NEST
 GOODBY MRS
 WAULE
 HERE MR
 FEATHERSTONEPULLED AT BOTH SIDES OF HIS WIG AS IF HE WANTED TO DEAFEN HIMSELF ANDHIS SISTER WENT AWAY RUMINATING ON THIS ORACULAR SPEECH OF HIS
NOTWITHSTANDING HER JEALOUSY OF THE VINCYS AND OF MARY GARTH THEREREMAINED AS THE NETHERMOST SEDIMENT IN HER MENTAL SHALLOWS A PERSUASIONTHAT HER BROTHER PETER FEATHERSTONE COULD NEVER LEAVE HIS CHIEFPROPERTY AWAY FROM HIS BLOODRELATIONSELSE WHY HAD THE ALMIGHTYCARRIED OFF HIS TWO WIVES BOTH CHILDLESS AFTER HE HAD GAINED SO MUCHBY MANGANESE AND THINGS TURNING UP WHEN NOBODY EXPECTED IT
AND WHYWAS THERE A LOWICK PARISH CHURCH AND THE WAULES AND POWDERELLS ALLSITTING IN THE SAME PEW FOR GENERATIONS AND THE FEATHERSTONE PEW NEXTTO THEM IF THE SUNDAY AFTER HER BROTHER PETERS DEATH EVERYBODY WASTO KNOW THAT THE PROPERTY WAS GONE OUT OF THE FAMILY
 THE HUMAN MINDHAS AT NO PERIOD ACCEPTED A MORAL CHAOS AND SO PREPOSTEROUS A RESULTWAS NOT STRICTLY CONCEIVABLE
 BUT WE ARE FRIGHTENED AT MUCH THAT IS NOTSTRICTLY CONCEIVABLE
WHEN FRED CAME IN THE OLD MAN EYED HIM WITH A PECULIAR TWINKLE WHICHTHE YOUNGER HAD OFTEN HAD REASON TO INTERPRET AS PRIDE IN THESATISFACTORY DETAILS OF HIS APPEARANCE
YOU TWO MISSES GO AWAY SAID MR
 FEATHERSTONE
 I WANT TO SPEAK TOFRED
COME INTO MY ROOM ROSAMOND YOU WILL NOT MIND THE COLD FOR A LITTLEWHILE SAID MARY
 THE TWO GIRLS HAD NOT ONLY KNOWN EACH OTHER INCHILDHOOD BUT HAD BEEN AT THE SAME PROVINCIAL SCHOOL TOGETHER MARY ASAN ARTICLED PUPIL SO THAT THEY HAD MANY MEMORIES IN COMMON AND LIKEDVERY WELL TO TALK IN PRIVATE
 INDEED THIS TÊTEÀTÊTE WAS ONE OFROSAMONDS OBJECTS IN COMING TO STONE COURT
OLD FEATHERSTONE WOULD NOT BEGIN THE DIALOGUE TILL THE DOOR HAD BEENCLOSED
 HE CONTINUED TO LOOK AT FRED WITH THE SAME TWINKLE AND WITH ONEOF HIS HABITUAL GRIMACES ALTERNATELY SCREWING AND WIDENING HIS MOUTHAND WHEN HE SPOKE IT WAS IN A LOW TONE WHICH MIGHT BE TAKEN FOR THATOF AN INFORMER READY TO BE BOUGHT OFF RATHER THAN FOR THE TONE OF ANOFFENDED SENIOR
 HE WAS NOT A MAN TO FEEL ANY STRONG MORAL INDIGNATIONEVEN ON ACCOUNT OF TRESPASSES AGAINST HIMSELF
 IT WAS NATURAL THATOTHERS SHOULD WANT TO GET AN ADVANTAGE OVER HIM BUT THEN HE WAS ALITTLE TOO CUNNING FOR THEM
SO SIR YOUVE BEEN PAYING TEN PER CENT FOR MONEY WHICH YOUVEPROMISED TO PAY OFF BY MORTGAGING MY LAND WHEN IM DEAD AND GONE EH
YOU PUT MY LIFE AT A TWELVEMONTH SAY
 BUT I CAN ALTER MY WILL YET
FRED BLUSHED
 HE HAD NOT BORROWED MONEY IN THAT WAY FOR EXCELLENTREASONS
 BUT HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF HAVING SPOKEN WITH SOME CONFIDENCEPERHAPS WITH MORE THAN HE EXACTLY REMEMBERED ABOUT HIS PROSPECT OFGETTING FEATHERSTONES LAND AS A FUTURE MEANS OF PAYING PRESENT DEBTS
I DONT KNOW WHAT YOU REFER TO SIR
 I HAVE CERTAINLY NEVER BORROWEDANY MONEY ON SUCH AN INSECURITY
 PLEASE DO EXPLAIN
NO SIR ITS YOU MUST EXPLAIN
 I CAN ALTER MY WILL YET LET ME TELLYOU
 IM OF SOUND MINDCAN RECKON COMPOUND INTEREST IN MY HEAD ANDREMEMBER EVERY FOOLS NAME AS WELL AS I COULD TWENTY YEARS AGO
 WHATTHE DEUCE
 IM UNDER EIGHTY
 I SAY YOU MUST CONTRADICT THIS STORY
I HAVE CONTRADICTED IT SIR FRED ANSWERED WITH A TOUCH OFIMPATIENCE NOT REMEMBERING THAT HIS UNCLE DID NOT VERBALLYDISCRIMINATE CONTRADICTING FROM DISPROVING THOUGH NO ONE WAS FURTHERFROM CONFOUNDING THE TWO IDEAS THAN OLD FEATHERSTONE WHO OFTENWONDERED THAT SO MANY FOOLS TOOK HIS OWN ASSERTIONS FOR PROOFS
 BUT ICONTRADICT IT AGAIN
 THE STORY IS A SILLY LIE
NONSENSE
 YOU MUST BRING DOCKIMENTS
 IT COMES FROM AUTHORITY
NAME THE AUTHORITY AND MAKE HIM NAME THE MAN OF WHOM I BORROWED THEMONEY AND THEN I CAN DISPROVE THE STORY
ITS PRETTY GOOD AUTHORITY I THINKA MAN WHO KNOWS MOST OF WHAT GOESON IN MIDDLEMARCH
 ITS THAT FINE RELIGIOUS CHARITABLE UNCLE OYOURS
 COME NOW
 HERE MR
 FEATHERSTONE HAD HIS PECULIAR INWARD SHAKEWHICH SIGNIFIED MERRIMENT
MR
 BULSTRODE
WHO ELSE EH
THEN THE STORY HAS GROWN INTO THIS LIE OUT OF SOME SERMONIZING WORDSHE MAY HAVE LET FALL ABOUT ME
 DO THEY PRETEND THAT HE NAMED THE MANWHO LENT ME THE MONEY
IF THERE IS SUCH A MAN DEPEND UPON IT BULSTRODE KNOWS HIM
 BUTSUPPOSING YOU ONLY TRIED TO GET THE MONEY LENT AND DIDNT GETITBULSTRODE UD KNOW THAT TOO
 YOU BRING ME A WRITING FROM BULSTRODETO SAY HE DOESNT BELIEVE YOUVE EVER PROMISED TO PAY YOUR DEBTS OUT OMY LAND
 COME NOW
MR
 FEATHERSTONES FACE REQUIRED ITS WHOLE SCALE OF GRIMACES AS AMUSCULAR OUTLET TO HIS SILENT TRIUMPH IN THE SOUNDNESS OF HISFACULTIES
FRED FELT HIMSELF TO BE IN A DISGUSTING DILEMMA
YOU MUST BE JOKING SIR
 MR
 BULSTRODE LIKE OTHER MEN BELIEVESSCORES OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT TRUE AND HE HAS A PREJUDICE AGAINST ME
I COULD EASILY GET HIM TO WRITE THAT HE KNEW NO FACTS IN PROOF OF THEREPORT YOU SPEAK OF THOUGH IT MIGHT LEAD TO UNPLEASANTNESS
 BUT ICOULD HARDLY ASK HIM TO WRITE DOWN WHAT HE BELIEVES OR DOES NOT BELIEVEABOUT ME
 FRED PAUSED AN INSTANT AND THEN ADDED IN POLITIC APPEAL TOHIS UNCLES VANITY THAT IS HARDLY A THING FOR A GENTLEMAN TO ASK
BUT HE WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE RESULT
AY I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
 YOUD SOONER OFFEND ME THAN BULSTRODE
 ANDWHATS HE
HES GOT NO LAND HEREABOUT THAT EVER I HEARD TELL OF
 ASPECKILATING FELLOW
 HE MAY COME DOWN ANY DAY WHEN THE DEVIL LEAVESOFF BACKING HIM
 AND THATS WHAT HIS RELIGION MEANS HE WANTS GODAMIGHTY TO COME IN
 THATS NONSENSE
 THERES ONE THING I MADE OUTPRETTY CLEAR WHEN I USED TO GO TO CHURCHAND ITS THIS GOD AMIGHTYSTICKS TO THE LAND
 HE PROMISES LAND AND HE GIVES LAND AND HE MAKESCHAPS RICH WITH CORN AND CATTLE
 BUT YOU TAKE THE OTHER SIDE
 YOU LIKEBULSTRODE AND SPECKILATION BETTER THAN FEATHERSTONE AND LAND
I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR SAID FRED RISING STANDING WITH HIS BACK TOTHE FIRE AND BEATING HIS BOOT WITH HIS WHIP
 I LIKE NEITHER BULSTRODENOR SPECULATION
 HE SPOKE RATHER SULKILY FEELING HIMSELF STALEMATED
WELL WELL YOU CAN DO WITHOUT ME THATS PRETTY CLEAR SAID OLDFEATHERSTONE SECRETLY DISLIKING THE POSSIBILITY THAT FRED WOULD SHOWHIMSELF AT ALL INDEPENDENT
 YOU NEITHER WANT A BIT OF LAND TO MAKE ASQUIRE OF YOU INSTEAD OF A STARVING PARSON NOR A LIFT OF A HUNDREDPOUND BY THE WAY
 ITS ALL ONE TO ME
 I CAN MAKE FIVE CODICILS IF ILIKE AND I SHALL KEEP MY BANKNOTES FOR A NESTEGG
 ITS ALL ONE TOME
FRED COLORED AGAIN
 FEATHERSTONE HAD RARELY GIVEN HIM PRESENTS OFMONEY AND AT THIS MOMENT IT SEEMED ALMOST HARDER TO PART WITH THEIMMEDIATE PROSPECT OF BANKNOTES THAN WITH THE MORE DISTANT PROSPECT OFTHE LAND
I AM NOT UNGRATEFUL SIR
 I NEVER MEANT TO SHOW DISREGARD FOR ANY KINDINTENTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE TOWARDS ME
 ON THE CONTRARY
VERY GOOD
 THEN PROVE IT
 YOU BRING ME A LETTER FROM BULSTRODE SAYINGHE DOESNT BELIEVE YOUVE BEEN CRACKING AND PROMISING TO PAY YOUR DEBTSOUT O MY LAND AND THEN IF THERES ANY SCRAPE YOUVE GOT INTO WELLSEE IF I CANT BACK YOU A BIT
 COME NOW
 THATS A BARGAIN
 HERE GIVEME YOUR ARM
 ILL TRY AND WALK ROUND THE ROOM
FRED IN SPITE OF HIS IRRITATION HAD KINDNESS ENOUGH IN HIM TO BE ALITTLE SORRY FOR THE UNLOVED UNVENERATED OLD MAN WHO WITH HISDROPSICAL LEGS LOOKED MORE THAN USUALLY PITIABLE IN WALKING
 WHILEGIVING HIS ARM HE THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD NOT HIMSELF LIKE TO BE AN OLDFELLOW WITH HIS CONSTITUTION BREAKING UP AND HE WAITEDGOODTEMPEREDLY FIRST BEFORE THE WINDOW TO HEAR THE WONTED REMARKSABOUT THE GUINEAFOWLS AND THE WEATHERCOCK AND THEN BEFORE THE SCANTYBOOKSHELVES OF WHICH THE CHIEF GLORIES IN DARK CALF WERE JOSEPHUSCULPEPPER KLOPSTOCKS MESSIAH AND SEVERAL VOLUMES OF THEGENTLEMANS MAGAZINE
READ ME THE NAMES O THE BOOKS
 COME NOW
 YOURE A COLLEGE MAN
FRED GAVE HIM THE TITLES
WHAT DID MISSY WANT WITH MORE BOOKS
 WHAT MUST YOU BE BRINGING HERMORE BOOKS FOR
THEY AMUSE HER SIR
 SHE IS VERY FOND OF READING
A LITTLE TOO FOND SAID MR
 FEATHERSTONE CAPTIOUSLY
 SHE WAS FORREADING WHEN SHE SAT WITH ME
 BUT I PUT A STOP TO THAT
 SHES GOT THENEWSPAPER TO READ OUT LOUD
 THATS ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY I SHOULD THINK
I CANT ABIDE TO SEE HER READING TO HERSELF
 YOU MIND AND NOT BRING HERANY MORE BOOKS DO YOU HEAR
YES SIR I HEAR
 FRED HAD RECEIVED THIS ORDER BEFORE AND HADSECRETLY DISOBEYED IT
 HE INTENDED TO DISOBEY IT AGAIN
RING THE BELL SAID MR
 FEATHERSTONE I WANT MISSY TO COME DOWN
ROSAMOND AND MARY HAD BEEN TALKING FASTER THAN THEIR MALE FRIENDS
 THEYDID NOT THINK OF SITTING DOWN BUT STOOD AT THE TOILETTABLE NEAR THEWINDOW WHILE ROSAMOND TOOK OFF HER HAT ADJUSTED HER VEIL AND APPLIEDLITTLE TOUCHES OF HER FINGERTIPS TO HER HAIRHAIR OF INFANTINEFAIRNESS NEITHER FLAXEN NOR YELLOW
 MARY GARTH SEEMED ALL THE PLAINERSTANDING AT AN ANGLE BETWEEN THE TWO NYMPHSTHE ONE IN THE GLASS ANDTHE ONE OUT OF IT WHO LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH EYES OF HEAVENLY BLUEDEEP ENOUGH TO HOLD THE MOST EXQUISITE MEANINGS AN INGENIOUS BEHOLDERCOULD PUT INTO THEM AND DEEP ENOUGH TO HIDE THE MEANINGS OF THE OWNERIF THESE SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE LESS EXQUISITE
 ONLY A FEW CHILDREN INMIDDLEMARCH LOOKED BLOND BY THE SIDE OF ROSAMOND AND THE SLIM FIGUREDISPLAYED BY HER RIDINGHABIT HAD DELICATE UNDULATIONS
 IN FACT MOSTMEN IN MIDDLEMARCH EXCEPT HER BROTHERS HELD THAT MISS VINCY WAS THEBEST GIRL IN THE WORLD AND SOME CALLED HER AN ANGEL
 MARY GARTH ONTHE CONTRARY HAD THE ASPECT OF AN ORDINARY SINNER SHE WAS BROWN HERCURLY DARK HAIR WAS ROUGH AND STUBBORN HER STATURE WAS LOW AND ITWOULD NOT BE TRUE TO DECLARE IN SATISFACTORY ANTITHESIS THAT SHE HADALL THE VIRTUES
 PLAINNESS HAS ITS PECULIAR TEMPTATIONS AND VICES QUITEAS MUCH AS BEAUTY IT IS APT EITHER TO FEIGN AMIABILITY OR NOTFEIGNING IT TO SHOW ALL THE REPULSIVENESS OF DISCONTENT AT ANY RATETO BE CALLED AN UGLY THING IN CONTRAST WITH THAT LOVELY CREATURE YOURCOMPANION IS APT TO PRODUCE SOME EFFECT BEYOND A SENSE OF FINEVERACITY AND FITNESS IN THE PHRASE
 AT THE AGE OF TWOANDTWENTY MARYHAD CERTAINLY NOT ATTAINED THAT PERFECT GOOD SENSE AND GOOD PRINCIPLEWHICH ARE USUALLY RECOMMENDED TO THE LESS FORTUNATE GIRL AS IF THEYWERE TO BE OBTAINED IN QUANTITIES READY MIXED WITH A FLAVOR OFRESIGNATION AS REQUIRED
 HER SHREWDNESS HAD A STREAK OF SATIRICBITTERNESS CONTINUALLY RENEWED AND NEVER CARRIED UTTERLY OUT OF SIGHTEXCEPT BY A STRONG CURRENT OF GRATITUDE TOWARDS THOSE WHO INSTEAD OFTELLING HER THAT SHE OUGHT TO BE CONTENTED DID SOMETHING TO MAKE HERSO
 ADVANCING WOMANHOOD HAD TEMPERED HER PLAINNESS WHICH WAS OF A GOODHUMAN SORT SUCH AS THE MOTHERS OF OUR RACE HAVE VERY COMMONLY WORN INALL LATITUDES UNDER A MORE OR LESS BECOMING HEADGEAR
 REMBRANDT WOULDHAVE PAINTED HER WITH PLEASURE AND WOULD HAVE MADE HER BROAD FEATURESLOOK OUT OF THE CANVAS WITH INTELLIGENT HONESTY
 FOR HONESTYTRUTHTELLING FAIRNESS WAS MARYS REIGNING VIRTUE SHE NEITHER TRIEDTO CREATE ILLUSIONS NOR INDULGED IN THEM FOR HER OWN BEHOOF AND WHENSHE WAS IN A GOOD MOOD SHE HAD HUMOR ENOUGH IN HER TO LAUGH AT HERSELF
WHEN SHE AND ROSAMOND HAPPENED BOTH TO BE REFLECTED IN THE GLASS SHESAID LAUGHINGLYWHAT A BROWN PATCH I AM BY THE SIDE OF YOU ROSY
 YOU ARE THE MOSTUNBECOMING COMPANION
OH NO
 NO ONE THINKS OF YOUR APPEARANCE YOU ARE SO SENSIBLE ANDUSEFUL MARY
 BEAUTY IS OF VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE IN REALITY SAIDROSAMOND TURNING HER HEAD TOWARDS MARY BUT WITH EYES SWERVING TOWARDSTHE NEW VIEW OF HER NECK IN THE GLASS
YOU MEAN MY BEAUTY SAID MARY RATHER SARDONICALLY
ROSAMOND THOUGHT POOR MARY SHE TAKES THE KINDEST THINGS ILL
 ALOUDSHE SAID WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING LATELY
I
 OH MINDING THE HOUSEPOURING OUT SYRUPPRETENDING TO BE AMIABLEAND CONTENTEDLEARNING TO HAVE A BAD OPINION OF EVERYBODY
IT IS A WRETCHED LIFE FOR YOU
NO SAID MARY CURTLY WITH A LITTLE TOSS OF HER HEAD
 I THINK MYLIFE IS PLEASANTER THAN YOUR MISS MORGANS
YES BUT MISS MORGAN IS SO UNINTERESTING AND NOT YOUNG
SHE IS INTERESTING TO HERSELF I SUPPOSE AND I AM NOT AT ALL SURETHAT EVERYTHING GETS EASIER AS ONE GETS OLDER
NO SAID ROSAMOND REFLECTIVELY ONE WONDERS WHAT SUCH PEOPLE DOWITHOUT ANY PROSPECT
 TO BE SURE THERE IS RELIGION AS A SUPPORT
 BUTSHE ADDED DIMPLING IT IS VERY DIFFERENT WITH YOU MARY
 YOU MAY HAVEAN OFFER
HAS ANY ONE TOLD YOU HE MEANS TO MAKE ME ONE
OF COURSE NOT
 I MEAN THERE IS A GENTLEMAN WHO MAY FALL IN LOVE WITHYOU SEEING YOU ALMOST EVERY DAY
A CERTAIN CHANGE IN MARYS FACE WAS CHIEFLY DETERMINED BY THE RESOLVENOT TO SHOW ANY CHANGE
DOES THAT ALWAYS MAKE PEOPLE FALL IN LOVE
 SHE ANSWERED CARELESSLYIT SEEMS TO ME QUITE AS OFTEN A REASON FOR DETESTING EACH OTHER
NOT WHEN THEY ARE INTERESTING AND AGREEABLE
 I HEAR THAT MR
 LYDGATEIS BOTH
OH MR
 LYDGATE
 SAID MARY WITH AN UNMISTAKABLE LAPSE INTOINDIFFERENCE
 YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT HIM SHE ADDED NOTCHOOSING TO INDULGE ROSAMONDS INDIRECTNESS
MERELY HOW YOU LIKE HIM
THERE IS NO QUESTION OF LIKING AT PRESENT
 MY LIKING ALWAYS WANTS SOMELITTLE KINDNESS TO KINDLE IT
 I AM NOT MAGNANIMOUS ENOUGH TO LIKEPEOPLE WHO SPEAK TO ME WITHOUT SEEMING TO SEE ME
IS HE SO HAUGHTY
 SAID ROSAMOND WITH HEIGHTENED SATISFACTION
 YOUKNOW THAT HE IS OF GOOD FAMILY
NO HE DID NOT GIVE THAT AS A REASON
MARY
 YOU ARE THE ODDEST GIRL
 BUT WHAT SORT OF LOOKING MAN IS HE
DESCRIBE HIM TO ME
HOW CAN ONE DESCRIBE A MAN
 I CAN GIVE YOU AN INVENTORY HEAVYEYEBROWS DARK EYES A STRAIGHT NOSE THICK DARK HAIR LARGE SOLIDWHITE HANDSANDLET ME SEEOH AN EXQUISITE CAMBRICPOCKETHANDKERCHIEF
 BUT YOU WILL SEE HIM
 YOU KNOW THIS IS ABOUT THETIME OF HIS VISITS
ROSAMOND BLUSHED A LITTLE BUT SAID MEDITATIVELY I RATHER LIKE AHAUGHTY MANNER
 I CANNOT ENDURE A RATTLING YOUNG MAN
I DID NOT TELL YOU THAT MR
 LYDGATE WAS HAUGHTY BUT IL Y EN A POURTOUS LES GOÛTS AS LITTLE MAMSELLE USED TO SAY AND IF ANY GIRL CANCHOOSE THE PARTICULAR SORT OF CONCEIT SHE WOULD LIKE I SHOULD THINK ITIS YOU ROSY
HAUGHTINESS IS NOT CONCEIT I CALL FRED CONCEITED
I WISH NO ONE SAID ANY WORSE OF HIM
 HE SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL
 MRS
WAULE HAS BEEN TELLING UNCLE THAT FRED IS VERY UNSTEADY
 MARY SPOKEFROM A GIRLISH IMPULSE WHICH GOT THE BETTER OF HER JUDGMENT
 THERE WASA VAGUE UNEASINESS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD UNSTEADY WHICH SHE HOPEDROSAMOND MIGHT SAY SOMETHING TO DISSIPATE
 BUT SHE PURPOSELY ABSTAINEDFROM MENTIONING MRS
 WAULES MORE SPECIAL INSINUATION
OH FRED IS HORRID
 SAID ROSAMOND
 SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED HERSELFSO UNSUITABLE A WORD TO ANY ONE BUT MARY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY HORRID
HE IS SO IDLE AND MAKES PAPA SO ANGRY AND SAYS HE WILL NOT TAKEORDERS
I THINK FRED IS QUITE RIGHT
HOW CAN YOU SAY HE IS QUITE RIGHT MARY
 I THOUGHT YOU HAD MORE SENSEOF RELIGION
HE IS NOT FIT TO BE A CLERGYMAN
BUT HE OUGHT TO BE FIT
WELL THEN HE IS NOT WHAT HE OUGHT TO BE
 IKNOW SOME OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE SAME CASE
BUT NO ONE APPROVES OF THEM
 I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO MARRY A CLERGYMANBUT THERE MUST BE CLERGYMEN
IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT FRED MUST BE ONE
BUT WHEN PAPA HAS BEEN AT THE EXPENSE OF EDUCATING HIM FOR IT
 ANDONLY SUPPOSE IF HE SHOULD HAVE NO FORTUNE LEFT HIM
I CAN SUPPOSE THAT VERY WELL SAID MARY DRYLY
THEN I WONDER YOU CAN DEFEND FRED SAID ROSAMOND INCLINED TO PUSHTHIS POINT
I DONT DEFEND HIM SAID MARY LAUGHING I WOULD DEFEND ANY PARISHFROM HAVING HIM FOR A CLERGYMAN
BUT OF COURSE IF HE WERE A CLERGYMAN HE MUST BE DIFFERENT
YES HE WOULD BE A GREAT HYPOCRITE AND HE IS NOT THAT YET
IT IS OF NO USE SAYING ANYTHING TO YOU MARY
 YOU ALWAYS TAKE FREDSPART
WHY SHOULD I NOT TAKE HIS PART
 SAID MARY LIGHTING UP
 HE WOULDTAKE MINE
 HE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO TAKES THE LEAST TROUBLE TO OBLIGEME
YOU MAKE ME FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE MARY SAID ROSAMOND WITH HERGRAVEST MILDNESS I WOULD NOT TELL MAMMA FOR THE WORLD
WHAT WOULD YOU NOT TELL HER
 SAID MARY ANGRILY
PRAY DO NOT GO INTO A RAGE MARY SAID ROSAMOND MILDLY AS EVER
IF YOUR MAMMA IS AFRAID THAT FRED WILL MAKE ME AN OFFER TELL HER THATI WOULD NOT MARRY HIM IF HE ASKED ME
 BUT HE IS NOT GOING TO DO SOTHAT I AM AWARE
 HE CERTAINLY NEVER HAS ASKED ME
MARY YOU ARE ALWAYS SO VIOLENT
AND YOU ARE ALWAYS SO EXASPERATING
I
 WHAT CAN YOU BLAME ME FOR
OH BLAMELESS PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS THE MOST EXASPERATING
 THERE IS THEBELLI THINK WE MUST GO DOWN
I DID NOT MEAN TO QUARREL SAID ROSAMOND PUTTING ON HER HAT
QUARREL
 NONSENSE WE HAVE NOT QUARRELLED
 IF ONE IS NOT TO GET INTO ARAGE SOMETIMES WHAT IS THE GOOD OF BEING FRIENDS
AM I TO REPEAT WHAT YOU HAVE SAID
JUST AS YOU PLEASE
 I NEVER SAY WHAT I AM AFRAID OF HAVING REPEATED
BUT LET US GO DOWN
MR
 LYDGATE WAS RATHER LATE THIS MORNING BUT THE VISITORS STAYED LONGENOUGH TO SEE HIM FOR MR
 FEATHERSTONE ASKED ROSAMOND TO SING TO HIMAND SHE HERSELF WAS SO KIND AS TO PROPOSE A SECOND FAVORITE SONG OFHISFLOW ON THOU SHINING RIVERAFTER SHE HAD SUNG HOME SWEET HOMEWHICH SHE DETESTED
 THIS HARDHEADED OLD OVERREACH APPROVED OF THESENTIMENTAL SONG AS THE SUITABLE GARNISH FOR GIRLS AND ALSO ASFUNDAMENTALLY FINE SENTIMENT BEING THE RIGHT THING FOR A SONG
MR
 FEATHERSTONE WAS STILL APPLAUDING THE LAST PERFORMANCE ANDASSURING MISSY THAT HER VOICE WAS AS CLEAR AS A BLACKBIRDS WHEN MR
LYDGATES HORSE PASSED THE WINDOW
HIS DULL EXPECTATION OF THE USUAL DISAGREEABLE ROUTINE WITH AN AGEDPATIENTWHO CAN HARDLY BELIEVE THAT MEDICINE WOULD NOT SET HIM UP IFTHE DOCTOR WERE ONLY CLEVER ENOUGHADDED TO HIS GENERAL DISBELIEF INMIDDLEMARCH CHARMS MADE A DOUBLY EFFECTIVE BACKGROUND TO THIS VISIONOF ROSAMOND WHOM OLD FEATHERSTONE MADE HASTE OSTENTATIOUSLY TOINTRODUCE AS HIS NIECE THOUGH HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT IT WORTH WHILE TOSPEAK OF MARY GARTH IN THAT LIGHT
 NOTHING ESCAPED LYDGATE INROSAMONDS GRACEFUL BEHAVIOR HOW DELICATELY SHE WAIVED THE NOTICEWHICH THE OLD MANS WANT OF TASTE HAD THRUST UPON HER BY A QUIETGRAVITY NOT SHOWING HER DIMPLES ON THE WRONG OCCASION BUT SHOWINGTHEM AFTERWARDS IN SPEAKING TO MARY TO WHOM SHE ADDRESSED HERSELF WITHSO MUCH GOODNATURED INTEREST THAT LYDGATE AFTER QUICKLY EXAMININGMARY MORE FULLY THAN HE HAD DONE BEFORE SAW AN ADORABLE KINDNESS INROSAMONDS EYES
 BUT MARY FROM SOME CAUSE LOOKED RATHER OUT OF TEMPER
MISS ROSY HAS BEEN SINGING ME A SONGYOUVE NOTHING TO SAY AGAINSTTHAT EH DOCTOR
 SAID MR
 FEATHERSTONE
 I LIKE IT BETTER THAN YOURPHYSIC
THAT HAS MADE ME FORGET HOW THE TIME WAS GOING SAID ROSAMOND RISINGTO REACH HER HAT WHICH SHE HAD LAID ASIDE BEFORE SINGING SO THAT HERFLOWERLIKE HEAD ON ITS WHITE STEM WAS SEEN IN PERFECTION ABOVE HERRIDINGHABIT
 FRED WE MUST REALLY GO
VERY GOOD SAID FRED WHO HAD HIS OWN REASONS FOR NOT BEING IN THEBEST SPIRITS AND WANTED TO GET AWAY
MISS VINCY IS A MUSICIAN
 SAID LYDGATE FOLLOWING HER WITH HIS EYES
EVERY NERVE AND MUSCLE IN ROSAMOND WAS ADJUSTED TO THE CONSCIOUSNESSTHAT SHE WAS BEING LOOKED AT
 SHE WAS BY NATURE AN ACTRESS OF PARTSTHAT ENTERED INTO HER PHYSIQUE SHE EVEN ACTED HER OWN CHARACTER ANDSO WELL THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW IT TO BE PRECISELY HER OWN
THE BEST IN MIDDLEMARCH ILL BE BOUND SAID MR
 FEATHERSTONE LETTHE NEXT BE WHO SHE WILL
 EH FRED
 SPEAK UP FOR YOUR SISTER
IM AFRAID IM OUT OF COURT SIR
 MY EVIDENCE WOULD BE GOOD FORNOTHING
MIDDLEMARCH HAS NOT A VERY HIGH STANDARD UNCLE SAID ROSAMOND WITHA PRETTY LIGHTNESS GOING TOWARDS HER WHIP WHICH LAY AT A DISTANCE
LYDGATE WAS QUICK IN ANTICIPATING HER
 HE REACHED THE WHIP BEFORE SHEDID AND TURNED TO PRESENT IT TO HER
 SHE BOWED AND LOOKED AT HIM HEOF COURSE WAS LOOKING AT HER AND THEIR EYES MET WITH THAT PECULIARMEETING WHICH IS NEVER ARRIVED AT BY EFFORT BUT SEEMS LIKE A SUDDENDIVINE CLEARANCE OF HAZE
 I THINK LYDGATE TURNED A LITTLE PALER THANUSUAL BUT ROSAMOND BLUSHED DEEPLY AND FELT A CERTAIN ASTONISHMENT
AFTER THAT SHE WAS REALLY ANXIOUS TO GO AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT SORT OFSTUPIDITY HER UNCLE WAS TALKING OF WHEN SHE WENT TO SHAKE HANDS WITHHIM
YET THIS RESULT WHICH SHE TOOK TO BE A MUTUAL IMPRESSION CALLEDFALLING IN LOVE WAS JUST WHAT ROSAMOND HAD CONTEMPLATED BEFOREHAND
EVER SINCE THAT IMPORTANT NEW ARRIVAL IN MIDDLEMARCH SHE HAD WOVEN ALITTLE FUTURE OF WHICH SOMETHING LIKE THIS SCENE WAS THE NECESSARYBEGINNING
 STRANGERS WHETHER WRECKED AND CLINGING TO A RAFT OR DULYESCORTED AND ACCOMPANIED BY PORTMANTEAUS HAVE ALWAYS HAD ACIRCUMSTANTIAL FASCINATION FOR THE VIRGIN MIND AGAINST WHICH NATIVEMERIT HAS URGED ITSELF IN VAIN
 AND A STRANGER WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARYTO ROSAMONDS SOCIAL ROMANCE WHICH HAD ALWAYS TURNED ON A LOVER ANDBRIDEGROOM WHO WAS NOT A MIDDLEMARCHER AND WHO HAD NO CONNECTIONS ATALL LIKE HER OWN OF LATE INDEED THE CONSTRUCTION SEEMED TO DEMANDTHAT HE SHOULD SOMEHOW BE RELATED TO A BARONET
 NOW THAT SHE AND THESTRANGER HAD MET REALITY PROVED MUCH MORE MOVING THAN ANTICIPATIONAND ROSAMOND COULD NOT DOUBT THAT THIS WAS THE GREAT EPOCH OF HER LIFE
SHE JUDGED OF HER OWN SYMPTOMS AS THOSE OF AWAKENING LOVE AND SHE HELDIT STILL MORE NATURAL THAT MR
 LYDGATE SHOULD HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE ATFIRST SIGHT OF HER
 THESE THINGS HAPPENED SO OFTEN AT BALLS AND WHYNOT BY THE MORNING LIGHT WHEN THE COMPLEXION SHOWED ALL THE BETTER FORIT
 ROSAMOND THOUGH NO OLDER THAN MARY WAS RATHER USED TO BEINGFALLEN IN LOVE WITH BUT SHE FOR HER PART HAD REMAINED INDIFFERENTAND FASTIDIOUSLY CRITICAL TOWARDS BOTH FRESH SPRIG AND FADED BACHELOR
AND HERE WAS MR
 LYDGATE SUDDENLY CORRESPONDING TO HER IDEAL BEINGALTOGETHER FOREIGN TO MIDDLEMARCH CARRYING A CERTAIN AIR OFDISTINCTION CONGRUOUS WITH GOOD FAMILY AND POSSESSING CONNECTIONSWHICH OFFERED VISTAS OF THAT MIDDLECLASS HEAVEN RANK A MAN OFTALENT ALSO WHOM IT WOULD BE ESPECIALLY DELIGHTFUL TO ENSLAVE INFACT A MAN WHO HAD TOUCHED HER NATURE QUITE NEWLY AND BROUGHT A VIVIDINTEREST INTO HER LIFE WHICH WAS BETTER THAN ANY FANCIED MIGHTBESUCH AS SHE WAS IN THE HABIT OF OPPOSING TO THE ACTUAL
THUS IN RIDING HOME BOTH THE BROTHER AND THE SISTER WERE PREOCCUPIEDAND INCLINED TO BE SILENT
 ROSAMOND WHOSE BASIS FOR HER STRUCTURE HADTHE USUAL AIRY SLIGHTNESS WAS OF REMARKABLY DETAILED AND REALISTICIMAGINATION WHEN THE FOUNDATION HAD BEEN ONCE PRESUPPOSED AND BEFORETHEY HAD RIDDEN A MILE SHE WAS FAR ON IN THE COSTUME AND INTRODUCTIONSOF HER WEDDED LIFE HAVING DETERMINED ON HER HOUSE IN MIDDLEMARCH ANDFORESEEN THE VISITS SHE WOULD PAY TO HER HUSBANDS HIGHBRED RELATIVESAT A DISTANCE WHOSE FINISHED MANNERS SHE COULD APPROPRIATE ASTHOROUGHLY AS SHE HAD DONE HER SCHOOL ACCOMPLISHMENTS PREPARINGHERSELF THUS FOR VAGUER ELEVATIONS WHICH MIGHT ULTIMATELY COME
 THEREWAS NOTHING FINANCIAL STILL LESS SORDID IN HER PREVISIONS SHE CAREDABOUT WHAT WERE CONSIDERED REFINEMENTS AND NOT ABOUT THE MONEY THATWAS TO PAY FOR THEM
FREDS MIND ON THE OTHER HAND WAS BUSY WITH AN ANXIETY WHICH EVEN HISREADY HOPEFULNESS COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY QUELL
 HE SAW NO WAY OF ELUDINGFEATHERSTONES STUPID DEMAND WITHOUT INCURRING CONSEQUENCES WHICH HELIKED LESS EVEN THAN THE TASK OF FULFILLING IT
 HIS FATHER WAS ALREADYOUT OF HUMOR WITH HIM AND WOULD BE STILL MORE SO IF HE WERE THEOCCASION OF ANY ADDITIONAL COOLNESS BETWEEN HIS OWN FAMILY AND THEBULSTRODES
 THEN HE HIMSELF HATED HAVING TO GO AND SPEAK TO HIS UNCLEBULSTRODE AND PERHAPS AFTER DRINKING WINE HE HAD SAID MANY FOOLISHTHINGS ABOUT FEATHERSTONES PROPERTY AND THESE HAD BEEN MAGNIFIED BYREPORT
 FRED FELT THAT HE MADE A WRETCHED FIGURE AS A FELLOW WHOBRAGGED ABOUT EXPECTATIONS FROM A QUEER OLD MISER LIKE FEATHERSTONEAND WENT TO BEG FOR CERTIFICATES AT HIS BIDDING
 BUTTHOSEEXPECTATIONS
 HE REALLY HAD THEM AND HE SAW NO AGREEABLE ALTERNATIVEIF HE GAVE THEM UP BESIDES HE HAD LATELY MADE A DEBT WHICH GALLED HIMEXTREMELY AND OLD FEATHERSTONE HAD ALMOST BARGAINED TO PAY IT OFF
 THEWHOLE AFFAIR WAS MISERABLY SMALL HIS DEBTS WERE SMALL EVEN HISEXPECTATIONS WERE NOT ANYTHING SO VERY MAGNIFICENT
 FRED HAD KNOWN MENTO WHOM HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED OF CONFESSING THE SMALLNESS OF HISSCRAPES
 SUCH RUMINATIONS NATURALLY PRODUCED A STREAK OF MISANTHROPICBITTERNESS
 TO BE BORN THE SON OF A MIDDLEMARCH MANUFACTURER ANDINEVITABLE HEIR TO NOTHING IN PARTICULAR WHILE SUCH MEN AS MAINWARINGAND VYANCERTAINLY LIFE WAS A POOR BUSINESS WHEN A SPIRITED YOUNGFELLOW WITH A GOOD APPETITE FOR THE BEST OF EVERYTHING HAD SO POOR ANOUTLOOK
IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO FRED THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF BULSTRODES NAMEIN THE MATTER WAS A FICTION OF OLD FEATHERSTONES NOR COULD THIS HAVEMADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO HIS POSITION
 HE SAW PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT THE OLDMAN WANTED TO EXERCISE HIS POWER BY TORMENTING HIM A LITTLE AND ALSOPROBABLY TO GET SOME SATISFACTION OUT OF SEEING HIM ON UNPLEASANT TERMSWITH BULSTRODE
 FRED FANCIED THAT HE SAW TO THE BOTTOM OF HIS UNCLEFEATHERSTONES SOUL THOUGH IN REALITY HALF WHAT HE SAW THERE WAS NOMORE THAN THE REFLEX OF HIS OWN INCLINATIONS
 THE DIFFICULT TASK OFKNOWING ANOTHER SOUL IS NOT FOR YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHOSE CONSCIOUSNESS ISCHIEFLY MADE UP OF THEIR OWN WISHES
FREDS MAIN POINT OF DEBATE WITH HIMSELF WAS WHETHER HE SHOULD TELLHIS FATHER OR TRY TO GET THROUGH THE AFFAIR WITHOUT HIS FATHERSKNOWLEDGE
 IT WAS PROBABLY MRS
 WAULE WHO HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT HIMAND IF MARY GARTH HAD REPEATED MRS
 WAULES REPORT TO ROSAMOND ITWOULD BE SURE TO REACH HIS FATHER WHO WOULD AS SURELY QUESTION HIMABOUT IT
 HE SAID TO ROSAMOND AS THEY SLACKENED THEIR PACEROSY DID MARY TELL YOU THAT MRS
 WAULE HAD SAID ANYTHING ABOUT ME
YES INDEED SHE DID
WHAT
THAT YOU WERE VERY UNSTEADY
WAS THAT ALL
I SHOULD THINK THAT WAS ENOUGH FRED
YOU ARE SURE SHE SAID NO MORE
MARY MENTIONED NOTHING ELSE
 BUT REALLY FRED I THINK YOU OUGHT TO BEASHAMED
OH FUDGE
 DONT LECTURE ME
 WHAT DID MARY SAY ABOUT IT
I AM NOT OBLIGED TO TELL YOU
 YOU CARE SO VERY MUCH WHAT MARY SAYSAND YOU ARE TOO RUDE TO ALLOW ME TO SPEAK
OF COURSE I CARE WHAT MARY SAYS
 SHE IS THE BEST GIRL I KNOW
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT SHE WAS A GIRL TO FALL IN LOVE WITH
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT MEN WOULD FALL IN LOVE WITH
 GIRLS NEVER KNOW
AT LEAST FRED LET ME ADVISE YOU NOT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HER FORSHE SAYS SHE WOULD NOT MARRY YOU IF YOU ASKED HER
SHE MIGHT HAVE WAITED TILL I DID ASK HER
I KNEW IT WOULD NETTLE YOU FRED
NOT AT ALL
 SHE WOULD NOT HAVE SAID SO IF YOU HAD NOT PROVOKED HER
BEFORE REACHING HOME FRED CONCLUDED THAT HE WOULD TELL THE WHOLEAFFAIR AS SIMPLY AS POSSIBLE TO HIS FATHER WHO MIGHT PERHAPS TAKE ONHIMSELF THE UNPLEASANT BUSINESS OF SPEAKING TO BULSTRODE

CHAPTER XIII
ST GENT
 HOW CLASS YOUR MAN
AS BETTER THAN THE MOST    OR SEEMING BETTER WORSE BENEATH THAT CLOAK
    AS SAINT OR KNAVE PILGRIM OR HYPOCRITE
D GENT
 NAY TELL ME HOW YOU CLASS YOUR WEALTH OF BOOKS    THE DRIFTED RELICS OF ALL TIME
    AS WELL SORT THEM AT ONCE BY SIZE AND LIVERY    VELLUM TALL COPIES AND THE COMMON CALF    WILL HARDLY COVER MORE DIVERSITY    THAN ALL YOUR LABELS CUNNINGLY DEVISED    TO CLASS YOUR UNREAD AUTHORS
IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM FRED MR
 VINCY DETERMINED TOSPEAK WITH MR
 BULSTRODE IN HIS PRIVATE ROOM AT THE BANK AT HALFPASTONE WHEN HE WAS USUALLY FREE FROM OTHER CALLERS
 BUT A VISITOR HADCOME IN AT ONE OCLOCK AND MR
 BULSTRODE HAD SO MUCH TO SAY TO HIMTHAT THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE OF THE INTERVIEW BEING OVER IN HALF ANHOUR
 THE BANKERS SPEECH WAS FLUENT BUT IT WAS ALSO COPIOUS AND HEUSED UP AN APPRECIABLE AMOUNT OF TIME IN BRIEF MEDITATIVE PAUSES
 DONOT IMAGINE HIS SICKLY ASPECT TO HAVE BEEN OF THE YELLOW BLACKHAIREDSORT HE HAD A PALE BLOND SKIN THIN GRAYBESPRINKLED BROWN HAIRLIGHTGRAY EYES AND A LARGE FOREHEAD
 LOUD MEN CALLED HIS SUBDUED TONEAN UNDERTONE AND SOMETIMES IMPLIED THAT IT WAS INCONSISTENT WITHOPENNESS THOUGH THERE SEEMS TO BE NO REASON WHY A LOUD MAN SHOULD NOTBE GIVEN TO CONCEALMENT OF ANYTHING EXCEPT HIS OWN VOICE UNLESS IT CANBE SHOWN THAT HOLY WRIT HAS PLACED THE SEAT OF CANDOR IN THE LUNGS
 MR
BULSTRODE HAD ALSO A DEFERENTIAL BENDING ATTITUDE IN LISTENING AND ANAPPARENTLY FIXED ATTENTIVENESS IN HIS EYES WHICH MADE THOSE PERSONS WHOTHOUGHT THEMSELVES WORTH HEARING INFER THAT HE WAS SEEKING THE UTMOSTIMPROVEMENT FROM THEIR DISCOURSE
 OTHERS WHO EXPECTED TO MAKE NO GREATFIGURE DISLIKED THIS KIND OF MORAL LANTERN TURNED ON THEM
 IF YOU ARENOT PROUD OF YOUR CELLAR THERE IS NO THRILL OF SATISFACTION IN SEEINGYOUR GUEST HOLD UP HIS WINEGLASS TO THE LIGHT AND LOOK JUDICIAL
 SUCHJOYS ARE RESERVED FOR CONSCIOUS MERIT
 HENCE MR
 BULSTRODES CLOSEATTENTION WAS NOT AGREEABLE TO THE PUBLICANS AND SINNERS INMIDDLEMARCH IT WAS ATTRIBUTED BY SOME TO HIS BEING A PHARISEE AND BYOTHERS TO HIS BEING EVANGELICAL
 LESS SUPERFICIAL REASONERS AMONG THEMWISHED TO KNOW WHO HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER WERE OBSERVING THATFIVEANDTWENTY YEARS AGO NOBODY HAD EVER HEARD OF A BULSTRODE INMIDDLEMARCH
 TO HIS PRESENT VISITOR LYDGATE THE SCRUTINIZING LOOK WASA MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE HE SIMPLY FORMED AN UNFAVORABLE OPINION OFTHE BANKERS CONSTITUTION AND CONCLUDED THAT HE HAD AN EAGER INWARDLIFE WITH LITTLE ENJOYMENT OF TANGIBLE THINGS
I SHALL BE EXCEEDINGLY OBLIGED IF YOU WILL LOOK IN ON ME HEREOCCASIONALLY MR
 LYDGATE THE BANKER OBSERVED AFTER A BRIEF PAUSE
IF AS I DARE TO HOPE I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF FINDING YOU A VALUABLECOADJUTOR IN THE INTERESTING MATTER OF HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT THERE WILLBE MANY QUESTIONS WHICH WE SHALL NEED TO DISCUSS IN PRIVATE
 AS TO THENEW HOSPITAL WHICH IS NEARLY FINISHED I SHALL CONSIDER WHAT YOU HAVESAID ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF THE SPECIAL DESTINATION FOR FEVERS
 THEDECISION WILL REST WITH ME FOR THOUGH LORD MEDLICOTE HAS GIVEN THELAND AND TIMBER FOR THE BUILDING HE IS NOT DISPOSED TO GIVE HISPERSONAL ATTENTION TO THE OBJECT
THERE ARE FEW THINGS BETTER WORTH THE PAINS IN A PROVINCIAL TOWN LIKETHIS SAID LYDGATE
 A FINE FEVER HOSPITAL IN ADDITION TO THE OLDINFIRMARY MIGHT BE THE NUCLEUS OF A MEDICAL SCHOOL HERE WHEN ONCE WEGET OUR MEDICAL REFORMS AND WHAT WOULD DO MORE FOR MEDICAL EDUCATIONTHAN THE SPREAD OF SUCH SCHOOLS OVER THE COUNTRY
 A BORN PROVINCIAL MANWHO HAS A GRAIN OF PUBLIC SPIRIT AS WELL AS A FEW IDEAS SHOULD DO WHATHE CAN TO RESIST THE RUSH OF EVERYTHING THAT IS A LITTLE BETTER THANCOMMON TOWARDS LONDON
 ANY VALID PROFESSIONAL AIMS MAY OFTEN FIND AFREER IF NOT A RICHER FIELD IN THE PROVINCES
ONE OF LYDGATES GIFTS WAS A VOICE HABITUALLY DEEP AND SONOROUS YETCAPABLE OF BECOMING VERY LOW AND GENTLE AT THE RIGHT MOMENT
 ABOUT HISORDINARY BEARING THERE WAS A CERTAIN FLING A FEARLESS EXPECTATION OFSUCCESS A CONFIDENCE IN HIS OWN POWERS AND INTEGRITY MUCH FORTIFIED BYCONTEMPT FOR PETTY OBSTACLES OR SEDUCTIONS OF WHICH HE HAD HAD NOEXPERIENCE
 BUT THIS PROUD OPENNESS WAS MADE LOVABLE BY AN EXPRESSIONOF UNAFFECTED GOODWILL
 MR
 BULSTRODE PERHAPS LIKED HIM THE BETTER FORTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IN PITCH AND MANNERS HE CERTAINLY LIKEDHIM THE BETTER AS ROSAMOND DID FOR BEING A STRANGER IN MIDDLEMARCH
ONE CAN BEGIN SO MANY THINGS WITH A NEW PERSON
EVEN BEGIN TO BE ABETTER MAN
I SHALL REJOICE TO FURNISH YOUR ZEAL WITH FULLER OPPORTUNITIES MR
BULSTRODE ANSWERED I MEAN BY CONFIDING TO YOU THE SUPERINTENDENCE OFMY NEW HOSPITAL SHOULD A MATURER KNOWLEDGE FAVOR THAT ISSUE FOR I AMDETERMINED THAT SO GREAT AN OBJECT SHALL NOT BE SHACKLED BY OUR TWOPHYSICIANS
 INDEED I AM ENCOURAGED TO CONSIDER YOUR ADVENT TO THISTOWN AS A GRACIOUS INDICATION THAT A MORE MANIFEST BLESSING IS NOW TOBE AWARDED TO MY EFFORTS WHICH HAVE HITHERTO BEEN MUCH WITHSTOOD
 WITHREGARD TO THE OLD INFIRMARY WE HAVE GAINED THE INITIAL POINTI MEANYOUR ELECTION
 AND NOW I HOPE YOU WILL NOT SHRINK FROM INCURRING ACERTAIN AMOUNT OF JEALOUSY AND DISLIKE FROM YOUR PROFESSIONAL BRETHRENBY PRESENTING YOURSELF AS A REFORMER
I WILL NOT PROFESS BRAVERY SAID LYDGATE SMILING BUT I ACKNOWLEDGEA GOOD DEAL OF PLEASURE IN FIGHTING AND I SHOULD NOT CARE FOR MYPROFESSION IF I DID NOT BELIEVE THAT BETTER METHODS WERE TO BE FOUNDAND ENFORCED THERE AS WELL AS EVERYWHERE ELSE
THE STANDARD OF THAT PROFESSION IS LOW IN MIDDLEMARCH MY DEAR SIRSAID THE BANKER
 I MEAN IN KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL NOT IN SOCIAL STATUSFOR OUR MEDICAL MEN ARE MOST OF THEM CONNECTED WITH RESPECTABLETOWNSPEOPLE HERE
 MY OWN IMPERFECT HEALTH HAS INDUCED ME TO GIVE SOMEATTENTION TO THOSE PALLIATIVE RESOURCES WHICH THE DIVINE MERCY HASPLACED WITHIN OUR REACH
 I HAVE CONSULTED EMINENT MEN IN THEMETROPOLIS AND I AM PAINFULLY AWARE OF THE BACKWARDNESS UNDER WHICHMEDICAL TREATMENT LABORS IN OUR PROVINCIAL DISTRICTS
YESWITH OUR PRESENT MEDICAL RULES AND EDUCATION ONE MUST BESATISFIED NOW AND THEN TO MEET WITH A FAIR PRACTITIONER
 AS TO ALL THEHIGHER QUESTIONS WHICH DETERMINE THE STARTINGPOINT OF A DIAGNOSISASTO THE PHILOSOPHY OF MEDICAL EVIDENCEANY GLIMMERING OF THESE CAN ONLYCOME FROM A SCIENTIFIC CULTURE OF WHICH COUNTRY PRACTITIONERS HAVEUSUALLY NO MORE NOTION THAN THE MAN IN THE MOON
MR
 BULSTRODE BENDING AND LOOKING INTENTLY FOUND THE FORM WHICHLYDGATE HAD GIVEN TO HIS AGREEMENT NOT QUITE SUITED TO HISCOMPREHENSION
 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES A JUDICIOUS MAN CHANGES THETOPIC AND ENTERS ON GROUND WHERE HIS OWN GIFTS MAY BE MORE USEFUL
I AM AWARE HE SAID THAT THE PECULIAR BIAS OF MEDICAL ABILITY ISTOWARDS MATERIAL MEANS
 NEVERTHELESS MR
 LYDGATE I HOPE WE SHALL NOTVARY IN SENTIMENT AS TO A MEASURE IN WHICH YOU ARE NOT LIKELY TO BEACTIVELY CONCERNED BUT IN WHICH YOUR SYMPATHETIC CONCURRENCE MAY BE ANAID TO ME
 YOU RECOGNIZE I HOPE THE EXISTENCE OF SPIRITUAL INTERESTSIN YOUR PATIENTS
CERTAINLY I DO
 BUT THOSE WORDS ARE APT TO COVER DIFFERENT MEANINGS TODIFFERENT MINDS
PRECISELY
 AND ON SUCH SUBJECTS WRONG TEACHING IS AS FATAL AS NOTEACHING
 NOW A POINT WHICH I HAVE MUCH AT HEART TO SECURE IS A NEWREGULATION AS TO CLERICAL ATTENDANCE AT THE OLD INFIRMARY
 THE BUILDINGSTANDS IN MR
 FAREBROTHERS PARISH
 YOU KNOW MR
 FAREBROTHER
I HAVE SEEN HIM
 HE GAVE ME HIS VOTE
 I MUST CALL TO THANK HIM
 HESEEMS A VERY BRIGHT PLEASANT LITTLE FELLOW
 AND I UNDERSTAND HE IS ANATURALIST
MR
 FAREBROTHER MY DEAR SIR IS A MAN DEEPLY PAINFUL TO CONTEMPLATE
I SUPPOSE THERE IS NOT A CLERGYMAN IN THIS COUNTRY WHO HAS GREATERTALENTS
 MR
 BULSTRODE PAUSED AND LOOKED MEDITATIVE
I HAVE NOT YET BEEN PAINED BY FINDING ANY EXCESSIVE TALENT INMIDDLEMARCH SAID LYDGATE BLUNTLY
WHAT I DESIRE MR
 BULSTRODE CONTINUED LOOKING STILL MORE SERIOUSIS THAT MR
 FAREBROTHERS ATTENDANCE AT THE HOSPITAL SHOULD BESUPERSEDED BY THE APPOINTMENT OF A CHAPLAINOF MR
 TYKE IN FACTANDTHAT NO OTHER SPIRITUAL AID SHOULD BE CALLED IN
AS A MEDICAL MAN I COULD HAVE NO OPINION ON SUCH A POINT UNLESS I KNEWMR
 TYKE AND EVEN THEN I SHOULD REQUIRE TO KNOW THE CASES IN WHICH HEWAS APPLIED
 LYDGATE SMILED BUT HE WAS BENT ON BEING CIRCUMSPECT
OF COURSE YOU CANNOT ENTER FULLY INTO THE MERITS OF THIS MEASURE ATPRESENT
 BUTHERE MR
 BULSTRODE BEGAN TO SPEAK WITH A MORE CHISELLEDEMPHASISTHE SUBJECT IS LIKELY TO BE REFERRED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD OFTHE INFIRMARY AND WHAT I TRUST I MAY ASK OF YOU IS THAT IN VIRTUE OFTHE COOPERATION BETWEEN US WHICH I NOW LOOK FORWARD TO YOU WILL NOTSO FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED BE INFLUENCED BY MY OPPONENTS IN THISMATTER
I HOPE I SHALL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH CLERICAL DISPUTES SAIDLYDGATE
 THE PATH I HAVE CHOSEN IS TO WORK WELL IN MY OWN PROFESSION
MY RESPONSIBILITY MR
 LYDGATE IS OF A BROADER KIND
 WITH ME INDEEDTHIS QUESTION IS ONE OF SACRED ACCOUNTABLENESS WHEREAS WITH MYOPPONENTS I HAVE GOOD REASON TO SAY THAT IT IS AN OCCASION FORGRATIFYING A SPIRIT OF WORLDLY OPPOSITION
 BUT I SHALL NOT THEREFOREDROP ONE IOTA OF MY CONVICTIONS OR CEASE TO IDENTIFY MYSELF WITH THATTRUTH WHICH AN EVIL GENERATION HATES
 I HAVE DEVOTED MYSELF TO THISOBJECT OF HOSPITALIMPROVEMENT BUT I WILL BOLDLY CONFESS TO YOU MR
LYDGATE THAT I SHOULD HAVE NO INTEREST IN HOSPITALS IF I BELIEVED THATNOTHING MORE WAS CONCERNED THEREIN THAN THE CURE OF MORTAL DISEASES
 IHAVE ANOTHER GROUND OF ACTION AND IN THE FACE OF PERSECUTION I WILLNOT CONCEAL IT
MR
 BULSTRODES VOICE HAD BECOME A LOUD AND AGITATED WHISPER AS HE SAIDTHE LAST WORDS
THERE WE CERTAINLY DIFFER SAID LYDGATE
 BUT HE WAS NOT SORRY THATTHE DOOR WAS NOW OPENED AND MR
 VINCY WAS ANNOUNCED
 THAT FLORIDSOCIABLE PERSONAGE WAS BECOME MORE INTERESTING TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEENROSAMOND
 NOT THAT LIKE HER HE HAD BEEN WEAVING ANY FUTURE IN WHICHTHEIR LOTS WERE UNITED BUT A MAN NATURALLY REMEMBERS A CHARMING GIRLWITH PLEASURE AND IS WILLING TO DINE WHERE HE MAY SEE HER AGAIN
BEFORE HE TOOK LEAVE MR
 VINCY HAD GIVEN THAT INVITATION WHICH HE HADBEEN IN NO HURRY ABOUT FOR ROSAMOND AT BREAKFAST HAD MENTIONED THATSHE THOUGHT HER UNCLE FEATHERSTONE HAD TAKEN THE NEW DOCTOR INTO GREATFAVOR
MR
 BULSTRODE ALONE WITH HIS BROTHERINLAW POURED HIMSELF OUT AGLASS OF WATER AND OPENED A SANDWICHBOX
I CANNOT PERSUADE YOU TO ADOPT MY REGIMEN VINCY
NO NO IVE NO OPINION OF THAT SYSTEM
 LIFE WANTS PADDING SAID MR
VINCY UNABLE TO OMIT HIS PORTABLE THEORY
 HOWEVER HE WENT ONACCENTING THE WORD AS IF TO DISMISS ALL IRRELEVANCE WHAT I CAME HERETO TALK ABOUT WAS A LITTLE AFFAIR OF MY YOUNG SCAPEGRACE FREDS
THAT IS A SUBJECT ON WHICH YOU AND I ARE LIKELY TO TAKE QUITE ASDIFFERENT VIEWS AS ON DIET VINCY
I HOPE NOT THIS TIME
 MR
 VINCY WAS RESOLVED TO BE GOODHUMORED
THE FACT IS ITS ABOUT A WHIM OF OLD FEATHERSTONES
 SOMEBODY HASBEEN COOKING UP A STORY OUT OF SPITE AND TELLING IT TO THE OLD MAN TOTRY TO SET HIM AGAINST FRED
 HES VERY FOND OF FRED AND IS LIKELY TODO SOMETHING HANDSOME FOR HIM INDEED HE HAS AS GOOD AS TOLD FRED THATHE MEANS TO LEAVE HIM HIS LAND AND THAT MAKES OTHER PEOPLE JEALOUS
VINCY I MUST REPEAT THAT YOU WILL NOT GET ANY CONCURRENCE FROM ME ASTO THE COURSE YOU HAVE PURSUED WITH YOUR ELDEST SON
 IT WAS ENTIRELYFROM WORLDLY VANITY THAT YOU DESTINED HIM FOR THE CHURCH WITH A FAMILYOF THREE SONS AND FOUR DAUGHTERS YOU WERE NOT WARRANTED IN DEVOTINGMONEY TO AN EXPENSIVE EDUCATION WHICH HAS SUCCEEDED IN NOTHING BUT INGIVING HIM EXTRAVAGANT IDLE HABITS
 YOU ARE NOW REAPING THECONSEQUENCES
TO POINT OUT OTHER PEOPLES ERRORS WAS A DUTY THAT MR
 BULSTRODE RARELYSHRANK FROM BUT MR
 VINCY WAS NOT EQUALLY PREPARED TO BE PATIENT
 WHENA MAN HAS THE IMMEDIATE PROSPECT OF BEING MAYOR AND IS READY IN THEINTERESTS OF COMMERCE TO TAKE UP A FIRM ATTITUDE ON POLITICSGENERALLY HE HAS NATURALLY A SENSE OF HIS IMPORTANCE TO THE FRAMEWORKOF THINGS WHICH SEEMS TO THROW QUESTIONS OF PRIVATE CONDUCT INTO THEBACKGROUND
 AND THIS PARTICULAR REPROOF IRRITATED HIM MORE THAN ANYOTHER
 IT WAS EMINENTLY SUPERFLUOUS TO HIM TO BE TOLD THAT HE WASREAPING THE CONSEQUENCES
 BUT HE FELT HIS NECK UNDER BULSTRODES YOKEAND THOUGH HE USUALLY ENJOYED KICKING HE WAS ANXIOUS TO REFRAIN FROMTHAT RELIEF
AS TO THAT BULSTRODE ITS NO USE GOING BACK
 IM NOT ONE OF YOURPATTERN MEN AND I DONT PRETEND TO BE
 I COULDNT FORESEE EVERYTHINGIN THE TRADE THERE WASNT A FINER BUSINESS IN MIDDLEMARCH THAN OURSAND THE LAD WAS CLEVER
 MY POOR BROTHER WAS IN THE CHURCH AND WOULDHAVE DONE WELLHAD GOT PREFERMENT ALREADY BUT THAT STOMACH FEVER TOOKHIM OFF ELSE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A DEAN BY THIS TIME
 I THINK I WASJUSTIFIED IN WHAT I TRIED TO DO FOR FRED
 IF YOU COME TO RELIGION ITSEEMS TO ME A MAN SHOULDNT WANT TO CARVE OUT HIS MEAT TO AN OUNCEBEFOREHANDONE MUST TRUST A LITTLE TO PROVIDENCE AND BE GENEROUS
 ITSA GOOD BRITISH FEELING TO TRY AND RAISE YOUR FAMILY A LITTLE IN MYOPINION ITS A FATHERS DUTY TO GIVE HIS SONS A FINE CHANCE
I DONT WISH TO ACT OTHERWISE THAN AS YOUR BEST FRIEND VINCY WHEN ISAY THAT WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN UTTERING JUST NOW IS ONE MASS OFWORLDLINESS AND INCONSISTENT FOLLY
VERY WELL SAID MR
 VINCY KICKING IN SPITE OF RESOLUTIONS I NEVERPROFESSED TO BE ANYTHING BUT WORLDLY AND WHATS MORE I DONT SEEANYBODY ELSE WHO IS NOT WORLDLY
 I SUPPOSE YOU DONT CONDUCT BUSINESSON WHAT YOU CALL UNWORLDLY PRINCIPLES
 THE ONLY DIFFERENCE I SEE ISTHAT ONE WORLDLINESS IS A LITTLE BIT HONESTER THAN ANOTHER
THIS KIND OF DISCUSSION IS UNFRUITFUL VINCY SAID MR
 BULSTRODEWHO FINISHING HIS SANDWICH HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK IN HIS CHAIR ANDSHADED HIS EYES AS IF WEARY
 YOU HAD SOME MORE PARTICULAR BUSINESS
YES YES
 THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT IS SOMEBODY HAS TOLD OLDFEATHERSTONE GIVING YOU AS THE AUTHORITY THAT FRED HAS BEEN BORROWINGOR TRYING TO BORROW MONEY ON THE PROSPECT OF HIS LAND
 OF COURSE YOUNEVER SAID ANY SUCH NONSENSE
 BUT THE OLD FELLOW WILL INSIST ON IT THATFRED SHOULD BRING HIM A DENIAL IN YOUR HANDWRITING THAT IS JUST A BITOF A NOTE SAYING YOU DONT BELIEVE A WORD OF SUCH STUFF EITHER OF HISHAVING BORROWED OR TRIED TO BORROW IN SUCH A FOOLS WAY
 I SUPPOSE YOUCAN HAVE NO OBJECTION TO DO THAT
PARDON ME
 I HAVE AN OBJECTION
 I AM BY NO MEANS SURE THAT YOUR SONIN HIS RECKLESSNESS AND IGNORANCEI WILL USE NO SEVERER WORDHAS NOTTRIED TO RAISE MONEY BY HOLDING OUT HIS FUTURE PROSPECTS OR EVEN THATSOME ONE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FOOLISH ENOUGH TO SUPPLY HIM ON SO VAGUE APRESUMPTION THERE IS PLENTY OF SUCH LAX MONEYLENDING AS OF OTHERFOLLY IN THE WORLD
BUT FRED GIVES ME HIS HONOR THAT HE HAS NEVER BORROWED MONEY ON THEPRETENCE OF ANY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HIS UNCLES LAND
 HE IS NOT A LIAR
I DONT WANT TO MAKE HIM BETTER THAN HE IS
 I HAVE BLOWN HIM UPWELLNOBODY CAN SAY I WINK AT WHAT HE DOES
 BUT HE IS NOT A LIAR
 AND ISHOULD HAVE THOUGHTBUT I MAY BE WRONGTHAT THERE WAS NO RELIGION TOHINDER A MAN FROM BELIEVING THE BEST OF A YOUNG FELLOW WHEN YOU DONTKNOW WORSE
 IT SEEMS TO ME IT WOULD BE A POOR SORT OF RELIGION TO PUT ASPOKE IN HIS WHEEL BY REFUSING TO SAY YOU DONT BELIEVE SUCH HARM OFHIM AS YOUVE GOT NO GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE
I AM NOT AT ALL SURE THAT I SHOULD BE BEFRIENDING YOUR SON BYSMOOTHING HIS WAY TO THE FUTURE POSSESSION OF FEATHERSTONES PROPERTY
I CANNOT REGARD WEALTH AS A BLESSING TO THOSE WHO USE IT SIMPLY AS AHARVEST FOR THIS WORLD
 YOU DO NOT LIKE TO HEAR THESE THINGS VINCYBUT ON THIS OCCASION I FEEL CALLED UPON TO TELL YOU THAT I HAVE NOMOTIVE FOR FURTHERING SUCH A DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY AS THAT WHICH YOUREFER TO
 I DO NOT SHRINK FROM SAYING THAT IT WILL NOT TEND TO YOURSONS ETERNAL WELFARE OR TO THE GLORY OF GOD
 WHY THEN SHOULD YOUEXPECT ME TO PEN THIS KIND OF AFFIDAVIT WHICH HAS NO OBJECT BUT TOKEEP UP A FOOLISH PARTIALITY AND SECURE A FOOLISH BEQUEST
IF YOU MEAN TO HINDER EVERYBODY FROM HAVING MONEY BUT SAINTS ANDEVANGELISTS YOU MUST GIVE UP SOME PROFITABLE PARTNERSHIPS THATS ALLI CAN SAY MR
 VINCY BURST OUT VERY BLUNTLY
 IT MAY BE FOR THE GLORYOF GOD BUT IT IS NOT FOR THE GLORY OF THE MIDDLEMARCH TRADE THATPLYMDALES HOUSE USES THOSE BLUE AND GREEN DYES IT GETS FROM THEBRASSING MANUFACTORY THEY ROT THE SILK THATS ALL I KNOW ABOUT IT
PERHAPS IF OTHER PEOPLE KNEW SO MUCH OF THE PROFIT WENT TO THE GLORY OFGOD THEY MIGHT LIKE IT BETTER
 BUT I DONT MIND SO MUCH ABOUT THATICOULD GET UP A PRETTY ROW IF I CHOSE
MR
 BULSTRODE PAUSED A LITTLE BEFORE HE ANSWERED
 YOU PAIN ME VERYMUCH BY SPEAKING IN THIS WAY VINCY
 I DO NOT EXPECT YOU TO UNDERSTANDMY GROUNDS OF ACTIONIT IS NOT AN EASY THING EVEN TO THREAD A PATH FORPRINCIPLES IN THE INTRICACIES OF THE WORLDSTILL LESS TO MAKE THETHREAD CLEAR FOR THE CARELESS AND THE SCOFFING
 YOU MUST REMEMBER IFYOU PLEASE THAT I STRETCH MY TOLERANCE TOWARDS YOU AS MY WIFESBROTHER AND THAT IT LITTLE BECOMES YOU TO COMPLAIN OF ME ASWITHHOLDING MATERIAL HELP TOWARDS THE WORLDLY POSITION OF YOUR FAMILY
I MUST REMIND YOU THAT IT IS NOT YOUR OWN PRUDENCE OR JUDGMENT THAT HASENABLED YOU TO KEEP YOUR PLACE IN THE TRADE
VERY LIKELY NOT BUT YOU HAVE BEEN NO LOSER BY MY TRADE YET SAID MR
VINCY THOROUGHLY NETTLED A RESULT WHICH WAS SELDOM MUCH RETARDED BYPREVIOUS RESOLUTIONS
 AND WHEN YOU MARRIED HARRIET I DONT SEE HOWYOU COULD EXPECT THAT OUR FAMILIES SHOULD NOT HANG BY THE SAME NAIL
 IFYOUVE CHANGED YOUR MIND AND WANT MY FAMILY TO COME DOWN IN THE WORLDYOUD BETTER SAY SO
 IVE NEVER CHANGED IM A PLAIN CHURCHMAN NOWJUST AS I USED TO BE BEFORE DOCTRINES CAME UP
 I TAKE THE WORLD AS IFIND IT IN TRADE AND EVERYTHING ELSE
 IM CONTENTED TO BE NO WORSETHAN MY NEIGHBORS
 BUT IF YOU WANT US TO COME DOWN IN THE WORLD SAYSO
 I SHALL KNOW BETTER WHAT TO DO THEN
YOU TALK UNREASONABLY
 SHALL YOU COME DOWN IN THE WORLD FOR WANT OFTHIS LETTER ABOUT YOUR SON
WELL WHETHER OR NOT I CONSIDER IT VERY UNHANDSOME OF YOU TO REFUSEIT
 SUCH DOINGS MAY BE LINED WITH RELIGION BUT OUTSIDE THEY HAVE ANASTY DOGINTHEMANGER LOOK
 YOU MIGHT AS WELL SLANDER FRED IT COMESPRETTY NEAR TO IT WHEN YOU REFUSE TO SAY YOU DIDNT SET A SLANDERGOING
 ITS THIS SORT OF THINGTHIS TYRANNICAL SPIRIT WANTING TO PLAYBISHOP AND BANKER EVERYWHEREITS THIS SORT OF THING MAKES A MANS NAMESTINK
VINCY IF YOU INSIST ON QUARRELLING WITH ME IT WILL BE EXCEEDINGLYPAINFUL TO HARRIET AS WELL AS MYSELF SAID MR
 BULSTRODE WITH ATRIFLE MORE EAGERNESS AND PALENESS THAN USUAL
I DONT WANT TO QUARREL
 ITS FOR MY INTERESTAND PERHAPS FOR YOURSTOOTHAT WE SHOULD BE FRIENDS
 I BEAR YOU NO GRUDGE I THINK NO WORSEOF YOU THAN I DO OF OTHER PEOPLE
 A MAN WHO HALF STARVES HIMSELF ANDGOES THE LENGTH IN FAMILY PRAYERS AND SO ON THAT YOU DO BELIEVES INHIS RELIGION WHATEVER IT MAY BE YOU COULD TURN OVER YOUR CAPITAL JUSTAS FAST WITH CURSING AND SWEARINGPLENTY OF FELLOWS DO
 YOU LIKE TO BEMASTER THERES NO DENYING THAT YOU MUST BE FIRST CHOP IN HEAVEN ELSEYOU WONT LIKE IT MUCH
 BUT YOURE MY SISTERS HUSBAND AND WE OUGHT TOSTICK TOGETHER AND IF I KNOW HARRIET SHELL CONSIDER IT YOUR FAULT IFWE QUARREL BECAUSE YOU STRAIN AT A GNAT IN THIS WAY AND REFUSE TO DOFRED A GOOD TURN
 AND I DONT MEAN TO SAY I SHALL BEAR IT WELL
 ICONSIDER IT UNHANDSOME
MR
 VINCY ROSE BEGAN TO BUTTON HIS GREATCOAT AND LOOKED STEADILY ATHIS BROTHERINLAW MEANING TO IMPLY A DEMAND FOR A DECISIVE ANSWER
THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT MR
 BULSTRODE HAD BEGUN BY ADMONISHINGMR
 VINCY AND HAD ENDED BY SEEING A VERY UNSATISFACTORY REFLECTION OFHIMSELF IN THE COARSE UNFLATTERING MIRROR WHICH THAT MANUFACTURERSMIND PRESENTED TO THE SUBTLER LIGHTS AND SHADOWS OF HIS FELLOWMEN ANDPERHAPS HIS EXPERIENCE OUGHT TO HAVE WARNED HIM HOW THE SCENE WOULDEND
 BUT A FULLFED FOUNTAIN WILL BE GENEROUS WITH ITS WATERS EVEN INTHE RAIN WHEN THEY ARE WORSE THAN USELESS AND A FINE FOUNT OFADMONITION IS APT TO BE EQUALLY IRREPRESSIBLE
IT WAS NOT IN MR
 BULSTRODES NATURE TO COMPLY DIRECTLY IN CONSEQUENCEOF UNCOMFORTABLE SUGGESTIONS
 BEFORE CHANGING HIS COURSE HE ALWAYSNEEDED TO SHAPE HIS MOTIVES AND BRING THEM INTO ACCORDANCE WITH HISHABITUAL STANDARD
 HE SAID AT LASTI WILL REFLECT A LITTLE VINCY
 I WILL MENTION THE SUBJECT TO HARRIET
I SHALL PROBABLY SEND YOU A LETTER
VERY WELL
 AS SOON AS YOU CAN PLEASE
 I HOPE IT WILL ALL BE SETTLEDBEFORE I SEE YOU TOMORROW
CHAPTER XIV
FOLLOWS HERE THE STRICT RECEIPTFOR THAT SAUCE TO DAINTY MEATNAMED IDLENESS WHICH MANY EATBY PREFERENCE AND CALL IT SWEETFIRST WATCH FOR MORSELS LIKE A HOUNDMIX WELL WITH BUFFETS STIR THEM ROUNDWITH GOOD THICK OIL OF FLATTERIES AND FROTH WITH MEAN SELFLAUDINGLIES
SERVE WARM THE VESSELS YOU MUST CHOOSETO KEEP IT IN ARE DEAD MENS SHOES
MR
 BULSTRODES CONSULTATION OF HARRIET SEEMED TO HAVE HAD THE EFFECTDESIRED BY MR
 VINCY FOR EARLY THE NEXT MORNING A LETTER CAME WHICHFRED COULD CARRY TO MR
 FEATHERSTONE AS THE REQUIRED TESTIMONY
THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS STAYING IN BED ON ACCOUNT OF THE COLD WEATHERAND AS MARY GARTH WAS NOT TO BE SEEN IN THE SITTINGROOM FRED WENTUPSTAIRS IMMEDIATELY AND PRESENTED THE LETTER TO HIS UNCLE WHOPROPPED UP COMFORTABLY ON A BEDREST WAS NOT LESS ABLE THAN USUAL TOENJOY HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF WISDOM IN DISTRUSTING AND FRUSTRATINGMANKIND
 HE PUT ON HIS SPECTACLES TO READ THE LETTER PURSING UP HISLIPS AND DRAWING DOWN THEIR CORNERS
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I WILL NOT DECLINE TO STATE MYCONVICTIONTCHAH
 WHAT FINE WORDS THE FELLOW PUTS
 HES AS FINE AS ANAUCTIONEERTHAT YOUR SON FREDERIC HAS NOT OBTAINED ANY ADVANCE OFMONEY ON BEQUESTS PROMISED BY MR
 FEATHERSTONEPROMISED
 WHO SAID IHAD EVER PROMISED
 I PROMISE NOTHINGI SHALL MAKE CODICILS AS LONG AS ILIKEAND THAT CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF SUCH A PROCEEDING IT ISUNREASONABLE TO PRESUME THAT A YOUNG MAN OF SENSE AND CHARACTER WOULDATTEMPT ITAH BUT THE GENTLEMAN DOESNT SAY YOU ARE A YOUNG MAN OFSENSE AND CHARACTER MARK YOU THAT SIR
AS TO MY OWN CONCERN WITH ANYREPORT OF SUCH A NATURE I DISTINCTLY AFFIRM THAT I NEVER MADE ANYSTATEMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT YOUR SON HAD BORROWED MONEY ON ANYPROPERTY THAT MIGHT ACCRUE TO HIM ON MR
 FEATHERSTONES DEMISEBLESSMY HEART
 PROPERTYACCRUEDEMISE
 LAWYER STANDISH IS NOTHING TO HIM
HE COULDNT SPEAK FINER IF HE WANTED TO BORROW
 WELL MR
 FEATHERSTONEHERE LOOKED OVER HIS SPECTACLES AT FRED WHILE HE HANDED BACK THELETTER TO HIM WITH A CONTEMPTUOUS GESTURE YOU DONT SUPPOSE I BELIEVEA THING BECAUSE BULSTRODE WRITES IT OUT FINE EH
FRED COLORED
 YOU WISHED TO HAVE THE LETTER SIR
 I SHOULD THINK ITVERY LIKELY THAT MR
 BULSTRODES DENIAL IS AS GOOD AS THE AUTHORITYWHICH TOLD YOU WHAT HE DENIES
EVERY BIT
 I NEVER SAID I BELIEVED EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER
 AND NOWWHAT D YOU EXPECT
 SAID MR
 FEATHERSTONE CURTLY KEEPING ON HISSPECTACLES BUT WITHDRAWING HIS HANDS UNDER HIS WRAPS
I EXPECT NOTHING SIR
 FRED WITH DIFFICULTY RESTRAINED HIMSELF FROMVENTING HIS IRRITATION
 I CAME TO BRING YOU THE LETTER
 IF YOU LIKE IWILL BID YOU GOOD MORNING
NOT YET NOT YET
 RING THE BELL I WANT MISSY TO COME
IT WAS A SERVANT WHO CAME IN ANSWER TO THE BELL
TELL MISSY TO COME
 SAID MR
 FEATHERSTONE IMPATIENTLY
 WHATBUSINESS HAD SHE TO GO AWAY
 HE SPOKE IN THE SAME TONE WHEN MARY CAME
WHY COULDNT YOU SIT STILL HERE TILL I TOLD YOU TO GO
 I WANT MYWAISTCOAT NOW
 I TOLD YOU ALWAYS TO PUT IT ON THE BED
MARYS EYES LOOKED RATHER RED AS IF SHE HAD BEEN CRYING
 IT WAS CLEARTHAT MR
 FEATHERSTONE WAS IN ONE OF HIS MOST SNAPPISH HUMORS THISMORNING AND THOUGH FRED HAD NOW THE PROSPECT OF RECEIVING THEMUCHNEEDED PRESENT OF MONEY HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED BEING FREE TOTURN ROUND ON THE OLD TYRANT AND TELL HIM THAT MARY GARTH WAS TOO GOODTO BE AT HIS BECK
 THOUGH FRED HAD RISEN AS SHE ENTERED THE ROOM SHEHAD BARELY NOTICED HIM AND LOOKED AS IF HER NERVES WERE QUIVERING WITHTHE EXPECTATION THAT SOMETHING WOULD BE THROWN AT HER
 BUT SHE NEVERHAD ANYTHING WORSE THAN WORDS TO DREAD
 WHEN SHE WENT TO REACH THEWAISTCOAT FROM A PEG FRED WENT UP TO HER AND SAID ALLOW ME
LET IT ALONE
 YOU BRING IT MISSY AND LAY IT DOWN HERE SAID MR
FEATHERSTONE
 NOW YOU GO AWAY AGAIN TILL I CALL YOU HE ADDED WHENTHE WAISTCOAT WAS LAID DOWN BY HIM
 IT WAS USUAL WITH HIM TO SEASON HISPLEASURE IN SHOWING FAVOR TO ONE PERSON BY BEING ESPECIALLYDISAGREEABLE TO ANOTHER AND MARY WAS ALWAYS AT HAND TO FURNISH THECONDIMENT
 WHEN HIS OWN RELATIVES CAME SHE WAS TREATED BETTER
 SLOWLYHE TOOK OUT A BUNCH OF KEYS FROM THE WAISTCOAT POCKET AND SLOWLY HEDREW FORTH A TIN BOX WHICH WAS UNDER THE BEDCLOTHES
YOU EXPECT I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE FORTUNE EH
 HE SAIDLOOKING ABOVE HIS SPECTACLES AND PAUSING IN THE ACT OF OPENING THE LID
NOT AT ALL SIR
 YOU WERE GOOD ENOUGH TO SPEAK OF MAKING ME A PRESENTTHE OTHER DAY ELSE OF COURSE I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF THEMATTER
 BUT FRED WAS OF A HOPEFUL DISPOSITION AND A VISION HADPRESENTED ITSELF OF A SUM JUST LARGE ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIM FROM ACERTAIN ANXIETY
 WHEN FRED GOT INTO DEBT IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO HIMHIGHLY PROBABLE THAT SOMETHING OR OTHERHE DID NOT NECESSARILY CONCEIVEWHATWOULD COME TO PASS ENABLING HIM TO PAY IN DUE TIME
 AND NOW THATTHE PROVIDENTIAL OCCURRENCE WAS APPARENTLY CLOSE AT HAND IT WOULD HAVEBEEN SHEER ABSURDITY TO THINK THAT THE SUPPLY WOULD BE SHORT OF THENEED AS ABSURD AS A FAITH THAT BELIEVED IN HALF A MIRACLE FOR WANT OFSTRENGTH TO BELIEVE IN A WHOLE ONE
THE DEEPVEINED HANDS FINGERED MANY BANKNOTES ONE AFTER THE OTHERLAYING THEM DOWN FLAT AGAIN WHILE FRED LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIRSCORNING TO LOOK EAGER
 HE HELD HIMSELF TO BE A GENTLEMAN AT HEART ANDDID NOT LIKE COURTING AN OLD FELLOW FOR HIS MONEY
 AT LAST MR
FEATHERSTONE EYED HIM AGAIN OVER HIS SPECTACLES AND PRESENTED HIM WITHA LITTLE SHEAF OF NOTES FRED COULD SEE DISTINCTLY THAT THERE WERE BUTFIVE AS THE LESS SIGNIFICANT EDGES GAPED TOWARDS HIM
 BUT THEN EACHMIGHT MEAN FIFTY POUNDS
 HE TOOK THEM SAYINGI AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU SIR AND WAS GOING TO ROLL THEM UPWITHOUT SEEMING TO THINK OF THEIR VALUE
 BUT THIS DID NOT SUIT MR
FEATHERSTONE WHO WAS EYING HIM INTENTLY
COME DONT YOU THINK IT WORTH YOUR WHILE TO COUNT EM
 YOU TAKE MONEYLIKE A LORD I SUPPOSE YOU LOSE IT LIKE ONE
I THOUGHT I WAS NOT TO LOOK A GIFTHORSE IN THE MOUTH SIR
 BUT ISHALL BE VERY HAPPY TO COUNT THEM
FRED WAS NOT SO HAPPY HOWEVER AFTER HE HAD COUNTED THEM
 FOR THEYACTUALLY PRESENTED THE ABSURDITY OF BEING LESS THAN HIS HOPEFULNESS HADDECIDED THAT THEY MUST BE
 WHAT CAN THE FITNESS OF THINGS MEAN IF NOTTHEIR FITNESS TO A MANS EXPECTATIONS
 FAILING THIS ABSURDITY ANDATHEISM GAPE BEHIND HIM
 THE COLLAPSE FOR FRED WAS SEVERE WHEN HE FOUNDTHAT HE HELD NO MORE THAN FIVE TWENTIES AND HIS SHARE IN THE HIGHEREDUCATION OF THIS COUNTRY DID NOT SEEM TO HELP HIM
 NEVERTHELESS HESAID WITH RAPID CHANGES IN HIS FAIR COMPLEXIONIT IS VERY HANDSOME OF YOU SIR
I SHOULD THINK IT IS SAID MR
 FEATHERSTONE LOCKING HIS BOX ANDREPLACING IT THEN TAKING OFF HIS SPECTACLES DELIBERATELY AND ATLENGTH AS IF HIS INWARD MEDITATION HAD MORE DEEPLY CONVINCED HIMREPEATING I SHOULD THINK IT HANDSOME
I ASSURE YOU SIR I AM VERY GRATEFUL SAID FRED WHO HAD HAD TIME TORECOVER HIS CHEERFUL AIR
SO YOU OUGHT TO BE
 YOU WANT TO CUT A FIGURE IN THE WORLD AND IRECKON PETER FEATHERSTONE IS THE ONLY ONE YOUVE GOT TO TRUST TO
 HERETHE OLD MANS EYES GLEAMED WITH A CURIOUSLY MINGLED SATISFACTION IN THECONSCIOUSNESS THAT THIS SMART YOUNG FELLOW RELIED UPON HIM AND THATTHE SMART YOUNG FELLOW WAS RATHER A FOOL FOR DOING SO
YES INDEED I WAS NOT BORN TO VERY SPLENDID CHANCES
 FEW MEN HAVEBEEN MORE CRAMPED THAN I HAVE BEEN SAID FRED WITH SOME SENSE OFSURPRISE AT HIS OWN VIRTUE CONSIDERING HOW HARDLY HE WAS DEALT WITH
IT REALLY SEEMS A LITTLE TOO BAD TO HAVE TO RIDE A BROKENWINDEDHUNTER AND SEE MEN WHO ARE NOT HALF SUCH GOOD JUDGES AS YOURSELFABLE TO THROW AWAY ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY ON BUYING BAD BARGAINS
WELL YOU CAN BUY YOURSELF A FINE HUNTER NOW
 EIGHTY POUND IS ENOUGHFOR THAT I RECKONAND YOULL HAVE TWENTY POUND OVER TO GET YOURSELFOUT OF ANY LITTLE SCRAPE SAID MR
 FEATHERSTONE CHUCKLING SLIGHTLY
YOU ARE VERY GOOD SIR SAID FRED WITH A FINE SENSE OF CONTRASTBETWEEN THE WORDS AND HIS FEELING
AY RATHER A BETTER UNCLE THAN YOUR FINE UNCLE BULSTRODE
 YOU WONTGET MUCH OUT OF HIS SPEKILATIONS I THINK
 HES GOT A PRETTY STRONGSTRING ROUND YOUR FATHERS LEG BY WHAT I HEAR EH
MY FATHER NEVER TELLS ME ANYTHING ABOUT HIS AFFAIRS SIR
WELL HE SHOWS SOME SENSE THERE
 BUT OTHER PEOPLE FIND EM OUT WITHOUTHIS TELLING
 HELL NEVER HAVE MUCH TO LEAVE YOU HELL MOSTLIKE DIEWITHOUT A WILLHES THE SORT OF MAN TO DO ITLET EM MAKE HIM MAYOR OFMIDDLEMARCH AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE
 BUT YOU WONT GET MUCH BY HIS DYINGWITHOUT A WILL THOUGH YOU ARE THE ELDEST SON
FRED THOUGHT THAT MR
 FEATHERSTONE HAD NEVER BEEN SO DISAGREEABLEBEFORE
 TRUE HE HAD NEVER BEFORE GIVEN HIM QUITE SO MUCH MONEY ATONCE
SHALL I DESTROY THIS LETTER OF MR
 BULSTRODES SIR
 SAID FREDRISING WITH THE LETTER AS IF HE WOULD PUT IT IN THE FIRE
AY AY I DONT WANT IT
 ITS WORTH NO MONEY TO ME
FRED CARRIED THE LETTER TO THE FIRE AND THRUST THE POKER THROUGH ITWITH MUCH ZEST
 HE LONGED TO GET OUT OF THE ROOM BUT HE WAS A LITTLEASHAMED BEFORE HIS INNER SELF AS WELL AS BEFORE HIS UNCLE TO RUN AWAYIMMEDIATELY AFTER POCKETING THE MONEY
 PRESENTLY THE FARMBAILIFF CAMEUP TO GIVE HIS MASTER A REPORT AND FRED TO HIS UNSPEAKABLE RELIEFWAS DISMISSED WITH THE INJUNCTION TO COME AGAIN SOON
HE HAD LONGED NOT ONLY TO BE SET FREE FROM HIS UNCLE BUT ALSO TO FINDMARY GARTH
 SHE WAS NOW IN HER USUAL PLACE BY THE FIRE WITH SEWING INHER HANDS AND A BOOK OPEN ON THE LITTLE TABLE BY HER SIDE
 HER EYELIDSHAD LOST SOME OF THEIR REDNESS NOW AND SHE HAD HER USUAL AIR OFSELFCOMMAND
AM I WANTED UPSTAIRS
 SHE SAID HALF RISING AS FRED ENTERED
NO I AM ONLY DISMISSED BECAUSE SIMMONS IS GONE UP
MARY SAT DOWN AGAIN AND RESUMED HER WORK
 SHE WAS CERTAINLY TREATINGHIM WITH MORE INDIFFERENCE THAN USUAL SHE DID NOT KNOW HOWAFFECTIONATELY INDIGNANT HE HAD FELT ON HER BEHALF UPSTAIRS
MAY I STAY HERE A LITTLE MARY OR SHALL I BORE YOU
PRAY SIT DOWN SAID MARY YOU WILL NOT BE SO HEAVY A BORE AS MR
JOHN WAULE WHO WAS HERE YESTERDAY AND HE SAT DOWN WITHOUT ASKING MYLEAVE
POOR FELLOW
 I THINK HE IS IN LOVE WITH YOU
I AM NOT AWARE OF IT
 AND TO ME IT IS ONE OF THE MOST ODIOUS THINGS INA GIRLS LIFE THAT THERE MUST ALWAYS BE SOME SUPPOSITION OF FALLING INLOVE COMING BETWEEN HER AND ANY MAN WHO IS KIND TO HER AND TO WHOM SHEIS GRATEFUL
 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT I AT LEAST MIGHT HAVE BEENSAFE FROM ALL THAT
 I HAVE NO GROUND FOR THE NONSENSICAL VANITY OFFANCYING EVERYBODY WHO COMES NEAR ME IS IN LOVE WITH ME
MARY DID NOT MEAN TO BETRAY ANY FEELING BUT IN SPITE OF HERSELF SHEENDED IN A TREMULOUS TONE OF VEXATION
CONFOUND JOHN WAULE
 I DID NOT MEAN TO MAKE YOU ANGRY
 I DIDNT KNOWYOU HAD ANY REASON FOR BEING GRATEFUL TO ME
 I FORGOT WHAT A GREATSERVICE YOU THINK IT IF ANY ONE SNUFFS A CANDLE FOR YOU
 FRED ALSO HADHIS PRIDE AND WAS NOT GOING TO SHOW THAT HE KNEW WHAT HAD CALLED FORTHTHIS OUTBURST OF MARYS
OH I AM NOT ANGRY EXCEPT WITH THE WAYS OF THE WORLD
 I DO LIKE TO BESPOKEN TO AS IF I HAD COMMONSENSE
 I REALLY OFTEN FEEL AS IF I COULDUNDERSTAND A LITTLE MORE THAN I EVER HEAR EVEN FROM YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHOHAVE BEEN TO COLLEGE
 MARY HAD RECOVERED AND SHE SPOKE WITH ASUPPRESSED RIPPLING UNDERCURRENT OF LAUGHTER PLEASANT TO HEAR
I DONT CARE HOW MERRY YOU ARE AT MY EXPENSE THIS MORNING SAID FREDI THOUGHT YOU LOOKED SO SAD WHEN YOU CAME UPSTAIRS
 IT IS A SHAME YOUSHOULD STAY HERE TO BE BULLIED IN THAT WAY
OH I HAVE AN EASY LIFEBY COMPARISON
 I HAVE TRIED BEING A TEACHERAND I AM NOT FIT FOR THAT MY MIND IS TOO FOND OF WANDERING ON ITS OWNWAY
 I THINK ANY HARDSHIP IS BETTER THAN PRETENDING TO DO WHAT ONE ISPAID FOR AND NEVER REALLY DOING IT
 EVERYTHING HERE I CAN DO AS WELLAS ANY ONE ELSE COULD PERHAPS BETTER THAN SOMEROSY FOR EXAMPLE
THOUGH SHE IS JUST THE SORT OF BEAUTIFUL CREATURE THAT IS IMPRISONEDWITH OGRES IN FAIRY TALES
ROSY
 CRIED FRED IN A TONE OF PROFOUND BROTHERLY SCEPTICISM
COME FRED
 SAID MARY EMPHATICALLY YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE SOCRITICAL
DO YOU MEAN ANYTHING PARTICULARJUST NOW
NO I MEAN SOMETHING GENERALALWAYS
OH THAT I AM IDLE AND EXTRAVAGANT
 WELL I AM NOT FIT TO BE A POORMAN
 I SHOULD NOT HAVE MADE A BAD FELLOW IF I HAD BEEN RICH
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE YOUR DUTY IN THAT STATE OF LIFE TO WHICH IT HASNOT PLEASED GOD TO CALL YOU SAID MARY LAUGHING
WELL I COULDNT DO MY DUTY AS A CLERGYMAN ANY MORE THAN YOU COULD DOYOURS AS A GOVERNESS
 YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A LITTLE FELLOWFEELING THEREMARY
I NEVER SAID YOU OUGHT TO BE A CLERGYMAN
 THERE ARE OTHER SORTS OFWORK
 IT SEEMS TO ME VERY MISERABLE NOT TO RESOLVE ON SOME COURSE ANDACT ACCORDINGLY
SO I COULD IF FRED BROKE OFF AND STOOD UP LEANING AGAINST THEMANTELPIECE
IF YOU WERE SURE YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE A FORTUNE
I DID NOT SAY THAT
 YOU WANT TO QUARREL WITH ME
 IT IS TOO BAD OF YOUTO BE GUIDED BY WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME
HOW CAN I WANT TO QUARREL WITH YOU
 I SHOULD BE QUARRELLING WITH ALLMY NEW BOOKS SAID MARY LIFTING THE VOLUME ON THE TABLE
 HOWEVERNAUGHTY YOU MAY BE TO OTHER PEOPLE YOU ARE GOOD TO ME
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE
 BUT I KNOW YOU DESPISEME
YES I DOA LITTLE SAID MARY NODDING WITH A SMILE
YOU WOULD ADMIRE A STUPENDOUS FELLOW WHO WOULD HAVE WISE OPINIONSABOUT EVERYTHING
YES I SHOULD
 MARY WAS SEWING SWIFTLY AND SEEMED PROVOKINGLYMISTRESS OF THE SITUATION
 WHEN A CONVERSATION HAS TAKEN A WRONG TURNFOR US WE ONLY GET FARTHER AND FARTHER INTO THE SWAMP OF AWKWARDNESS
THIS WAS WHAT FRED VINCY FELT
I SUPPOSE A WOMAN IS NEVER IN LOVE WITH ANY ONE SHE HAS ALWAYSKNOWNEVER SINCE SHE CAN REMEMBER AS A MAN OFTEN IS
 IT IS ALWAYS SOMENEW FELLOW WHO STRIKES A GIRL
LET ME SEE SAID MARY THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH CURLING ARCHLY IMUST GO BACK ON MY EXPERIENCE
 THERE IS JULIETSHE SEEMS AN EXAMPLE OFWHAT YOU SAY
 BUT THEN OPHELIA HAD PROBABLY KNOWN HAMLET A LONG WHILEAND BRENDA TROILSHE HAD KNOWN MORDAUNT MERTON EVER SINCE THEY WERECHILDREN BUT THEN HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN AN ESTIMABLE YOUNG MAN ANDMINNA WAS STILL MORE DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH CLEVELAND WHO WAS A STRANGER
WAVERLEY WAS NEW TO FLORA MACIVOR BUT THEN SHE DID NOT FALL IN LOVEWITH HIM
 AND THERE ARE OLIVIA AND SOPHIA PRIMROSE AND CORINNETHEYMAY BE SAID TO HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH NEW MEN
 ALTOGETHER MYEXPERIENCE IS RATHER MIXED
MARY LOOKED UP WITH SOME ROGUISHNESS AT FRED AND THAT LOOK OF HERS WASVERY DEAR TO HIM THOUGH THE EYES WERE NOTHING MORE THAN CLEAR WINDOWSWHERE OBSERVATION SAT LAUGHINGLY
 HE WAS CERTAINLY AN AFFECTIONATEFELLOW AND AS HE HAD GROWN FROM BOY TO MAN HE HAD GROWN IN LOVE WITHHIS OLD PLAYMATE NOTWITHSTANDING THAT SHARE IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION OFTHE COUNTRY WHICH HAD EXALTED HIS VIEWS OF RANK AND INCOME
WHEN A MAN IS NOT LOVED IT IS NO USE FOR HIM TO SAY THAT HE COULD BEA BETTER FELLOWCOULD DO ANYTHINGI MEAN IF HE WERE SURE OF BEINGLOVED IN RETURN
NOT OF THE LEAST USE IN THE WORLD FOR HIM TO SAY HE COULD BE BETTER
MIGHT COULD WOULDTHEY ARE CONTEMPTIBLE AUXILIARIES
I DONT SEE HOW A MAN IS TO BE GOOD FOR MUCH UNLESS HE HAS SOME ONEWOMAN TO LOVE HIM DEARLY
I THINK THE GOODNESS SHOULD COME BEFORE HE EXPECTS THAT
YOU KNOW BETTER MARY
 WOMEN DONT LOVE MEN FOR THEIR GOODNESS
PERHAPS NOT
 BUT IF THEY LOVE THEM THEY NEVER THINK THEM BAD
IT IS HARDLY FAIR TO SAY I AM BAD
I SAID NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT YOU
I NEVER SHALL BE GOOD FOR ANYTHING MARY IF YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT YOULOVE MEIF YOU WILL NOT PROMISE TO MARRY MEI MEAN WHEN I AM ABLE TOMARRY
IF I DID LOVE YOU I WOULD NOT MARRY YOU I WOULD CERTAINLY NOTPROMISE EVER TO MARRY YOU
I THINK THAT IS QUITE WICKED MARY
 IF YOU LOVE ME YOU OUGHT TOPROMISE TO MARRY ME
ON THE CONTRARY I THINK IT WOULD BE WICKED IN ME TO MARRY YOU EVEN IFI DID LOVE YOU
YOU MEAN JUST AS I AM WITHOUT ANY MEANS OF MAINTAINING A WIFE
 OFCOURSE I AM BUT THREEANDTWENTY
IN THAT LAST POINT YOU WILL ALTER
 BUT I AM NOT SO SURE OF ANY OTHERALTERATION
 MY FATHER SAYS AN IDLE MAN OUGHT NOT TO EXIST MUCH LESSBE MARRIED
THEN I AM TO BLOW MY BRAINS OUT
NO ON THE WHOLE I SHOULD THINK YOU WOULD DO BETTER TO PASS YOUREXAMINATION
 I HAVE HEARD MR
 FAREBROTHER SAY IT IS DISGRACEFULLYEASY
THAT IS ALL VERY FINE
 ANYTHING IS EASY TO HIM
 NOT THAT CLEVERNESSHAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT
 I AM TEN TIMES CLEVERER THAN MANY MEN WHOPASS
DEAR ME
 SAID MARY UNABLE TO REPRESS HER SARCASM THAT ACCOUNTS FORTHE CURATES LIKE MR
 CROWSE
 DIVIDE YOUR CLEVERNESS BY TEN AND THEQUOTIENTDEAR ME
IS ABLE TO TAKE A DEGREE
 BUT THAT ONLY SHOWS YOU ARETEN TIMES MORE IDLE THAN THE OTHERS
WELL IF I DID PASS YOU WOULD NOT WANT ME TO GO INTO THE CHURCH
THAT IS NOT THE QUESTIONWHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
 YOU HAVE A CONSCIENCEOF YOUR OWN I SUPPOSE
 THERE
 THERE IS MR
 LYDGATE
 I MUST GO AND TELLMY UNCLE
MARY SAID FRED SEIZING HER HAND AS SHE ROSE IF YOU WILL NOT GIVEME SOME ENCOURAGEMENT I SHALL GET WORSE INSTEAD OF BETTER
I WILL NOT GIVE YOU ANY ENCOURAGEMENT SAID MARY REDDENING
 YOURFRIENDS WOULD DISLIKE IT AND SO WOULD MINE
 MY FATHER WOULD THINK IT ADISGRACE TO ME IF I ACCEPTED A MAN WHO GOT INTO DEBT AND WOULD NOTWORK
FRED WAS STUNG AND RELEASED HER HAND
 SHE WALKED TO THE DOOR BUTTHERE SHE TURNED AND SAID FRED YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO GOOD SOGENEROUS TO ME
 I AM NOT UNGRATEFUL
 BUT NEVER SPEAK TO ME IN THAT WAYAGAIN
VERY WELL SAID FRED SULKILY TAKING UP HIS HAT AND WHIP
 HISCOMPLEXION SHOWED PATCHES OF PALE PINK AND DEAD WHITE
 LIKE MANY APLUCKED IDLE YOUNG GENTLEMAN HE WAS THOROUGHLY IN LOVE AND WITH APLAIN GIRL WHO HAD NO MONEY
 BUT HAVING MR
 FEATHERSTONES LAND IN THEBACKGROUND AND A PERSUASION THAT LET MARY SAY WHAT SHE WOULD SHEREALLY DID CARE FOR HIM FRED WAS NOT UTTERLY IN DESPAIR
WHEN HE GOT HOME HE GAVE FOUR OF THE TWENTIES TO HIS MOTHER ASKINGHER TO KEEP THEM FOR HIM
 I DONT WANT TO SPEND THAT MONEY MOTHER
 IWANT IT TO PAY A DEBT WITH
 SO KEEP IT SAFE AWAY FROM MY FINGERS
BLESS YOU MY DEAR SAID MRS
 VINCY
 SHE DOTED ON HER ELDEST SON ANDHER YOUNGEST GIRL A CHILD OF SIX WHOM OTHERS THOUGHT HER TWONAUGHTIEST CHILDREN
 THE MOTHERS EYES ARE NOT ALWAYS DECEIVED IN THEIRPARTIALITY SHE AT LEAST CAN BEST JUDGE WHO IS THE TENDERFILIALHEARTED CHILD
 AND FRED WAS CERTAINLY VERY FOND OF HIS MOTHER
PERHAPS IT WAS HIS FONDNESS FOR ANOTHER PERSON ALSO THAT MADE HIMPARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO TAKE SOME SECURITY AGAINST HIS OWN LIABILITY TOSPEND THE HUNDRED POUNDS
 FOR THE CREDITOR TO WHOM HE OWED A HUNDREDAND SIXTY HELD A FIRMER SECURITY IN THE SHAPE OF A BILL SIGNED BYMARYS FATHER
CHAPTER XV
BLACK EYES YOU HAVE LEFT YOU SAY    BLUE EYES FAIL TO DRAW YOUYET YOU SEEM MORE RAPT TODAY    THAN OF OLD WE SAW YOU
OH I TRACK THE FAIREST FAIR    THROUGH NEW HAUNTS OF PLEASUREFOOTPRINTS HERE AND ECHOES THERE    GUIDE ME TO MY TREASURELO
 SHE TURNSIMMORTAL YOUTH    WROUGHT TO MORTAL STATUREFRESH AS STARLIGHTS AGED TRUTH    MANYNAMÈD NATURE
A GREAT HISTORIAN AS HE INSISTED ON CALLING HIMSELF WHO HAD THEHAPPINESS TO BE DEAD A HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS AGO AND SO TO TAKE HISPLACE AMONG THE COLOSSI WHOSE HUGE LEGS OUR LIVING PETTINESS ISOBSERVED TO WALK UNDER GLORIES IN HIS COPIOUS REMARKS AND DIGRESSIONSAS THE LEAST IMITABLE PART OF HIS WORK AND ESPECIALLY IN THOSE INITIALCHAPTERS TO THE SUCCESSIVE BOOKS OF HIS HISTORY WHERE HE SEEMS TOBRING HIS ARMCHAIR TO THE PROSCENIUM AND CHAT WITH US IN ALL THE LUSTYEASE OF HIS FINE ENGLISH
 BUT FIELDING LIVED WHEN THE DAYS WERE LONGERFOR TIME LIKE MONEY IS MEASURED BY OUR NEEDS WHEN SUMMERAFTERNOONS WERE SPACIOUS AND THE CLOCK TICKED SLOWLY IN THE WINTEREVENINGS
 WE BELATED HISTORIANS MUST NOT LINGER AFTER HIS EXAMPLE ANDIF WE DID SO IT IS PROBABLE THAT OUR CHAT WOULD BE THIN AND EAGER ASIF DELIVERED FROM A CAMPSTOOL IN A PARROTHOUSE
 I AT LEAST HAVE SOMUCH TO DO IN UNRAVELING CERTAIN HUMAN LOTS AND SEEING HOW THEY WEREWOVEN AND INTERWOVEN THAT ALL THE LIGHT I CAN COMMAND MUST BECONCENTRATED ON THIS PARTICULAR WEB AND NOT DISPERSED OVER THATTEMPTING RANGE OF RELEVANCIES CALLED THE UNIVERSE
AT PRESENT I HAVE TO MAKE THE NEW SETTLER LYDGATE BETTER KNOWN TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN HIM THAN HE COULD POSSIBLY BE EVEN TO THOSE WHO HADSEEN THE MOST OF HIM SINCE HIS ARRIVAL IN MIDDLEMARCH
 FOR SURELY ALLMUST ADMIT THAT A MAN MAY BE PUFFED AND BELAUDED ENVIED RIDICULEDCOUNTED UPON AS A TOOL AND FALLEN IN LOVE WITH OR AT LEAST SELECTED ASA FUTURE HUSBAND AND YET REMAIN VIRTUALLY UNKNOWNKNOWN MERELY AS ACLUSTER OF SIGNS FOR HIS NEIGHBORS FALSE SUPPOSITIONS
 THERE WAS AGENERAL IMPRESSION HOWEVER THAT LYDGATE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER A COMMONCOUNTRY DOCTOR AND IN MIDDLEMARCH AT THAT TIME SUCH AN IMPRESSION WASSIGNIFICANT OF GREAT THINGS BEING EXPECTED FROM HIM
 FOR EVERYBODYSFAMILY DOCTOR WAS REMARKABLY CLEVER AND WAS UNDERSTOOD TO HAVEIMMEASURABLE SKILL IN THE MANAGEMENT AND TRAINING OF THE MOST SKITTISHOR VICIOUS DISEASES
 THE EVIDENCE OF HIS CLEVERNESS WAS OF THE HIGHERINTUITIVE ORDER LYING IN HIS LADYPATIENTS IMMOVABLE CONVICTION ANDWAS UNASSAILABLE BY ANY OBJECTION EXCEPT THAT THEIR INTUITIONS WEREOPPOSED BY OTHERS EQUALLY STRONG EACH LADY WHO SAW MEDICAL TRUTH INWRENCH AND THE STRENGTHENING TREATMENT REGARDING TOLLER AND THELOWERING SYSTEM AS MEDICAL PERDITION
 FOR THE HEROIC TIMES OF COPIOUSBLEEDING AND BLISTERING HAD NOT YET DEPARTED STILL LESS THE TIMES OFTHOROUGHGOING THEORY WHEN DISEASE IN GENERAL WAS CALLED BY SOME BADNAME AND TREATED ACCORDINGLY WITHOUT SHILLYSHALLYAS IF FOR EXAMPLEIT WERE TO BE CALLED INSURRECTION WHICH MUST NOT BE FIRED ON WITHBLANKCARTRIDGE BUT HAVE ITS BLOOD DRAWN AT ONCE
 THE STRENGTHENERSAND THE LOWERERS WERE ALL CLEVER MEN IN SOMEBODYS OPINION WHICH ISREALLY AS MUCH AS CAN BE SAID FOR ANY LIVING TALENTS
 NOBODYSIMAGINATION HAD GONE SO FAR AS TO CONJECTURE THAT MR
 LYDGATE COULDKNOW AS MUCH AS DR
 SPRAGUE AND DR
 MINCHIN THE TWO PHYSICIANS WHOALONE COULD OFFER ANY HOPE WHEN DANGER WAS EXTREME AND WHEN THESMALLEST HOPE WAS WORTH A GUINEA
 STILL I REPEAT THERE WAS A GENERALIMPRESSION THAT LYDGATE WAS SOMETHING RATHER MORE UNCOMMON THAN ANYGENERAL PRACTITIONER IN MIDDLEMARCH
 AND THIS WAS TRUE
 HE WAS BUTSEVENANDTWENTY AN AGE AT WHICH MANY MEN ARE NOT QUITE COMMONATWHICH THEY ARE HOPEFUL OF ACHIEVEMENT RESOLUTE IN AVOIDANCE THINKINGTHAT MAMMON SHALL NEVER PUT A BIT IN THEIR MOUTHS AND GET ASTRIDE THEIRBACKS BUT RATHER THAT MAMMON IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIMSHALL DRAW THEIR CHARIOT
HE HAD BEEN LEFT AN ORPHAN WHEN HE WAS FRESH FROM A PUBLIC SCHOOL
 HISFATHER A MILITARY MAN HAD MADE BUT LITTLE PROVISION FOR THREECHILDREN AND WHEN THE BOY TERTIUS ASKED TO HAVE A MEDICAL EDUCATIONIT SEEMED EASIER TO HIS GUARDIANS TO GRANT HIS REQUEST BY APPRENTICINGHIM TO A COUNTRY PRACTITIONER THAN TO MAKE ANY OBJECTIONS ON THE SCOREOF FAMILY DIGNITY
 HE WAS ONE OF THE RARER LADS WHO EARLY GET A DECIDEDBENT AND MAKE UP THEIR MINDS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING PARTICULAR IN LIFEWHICH THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO FOR ITS OWN SAKE AND NOT BECAUSE THEIRFATHERS DID IT
 MOST OF US WHO TURN TO ANY SUBJECT WITH LOVE REMEMBERSOME MORNING OR EVENING HOUR WHEN WE GOT ON A HIGH STOOL TO REACH DOWNAN UNTRIED VOLUME OR SAT WITH PARTED LIPS LISTENING TO A NEW TALKEROR FOR VERY LACK OF BOOKS BEGAN TO LISTEN TO THE VOICES WITHIN AS THEFIRST TRACEABLE BEGINNING OF OUR LOVE
 SOMETHING OF THAT SORT HAPPENEDTO LYDGATE
 HE WAS A QUICK FELLOW AND WHEN HOT FROM PLAY WOULD TOSSHIMSELF IN A CORNER AND IN FIVE MINUTES BE DEEP IN ANY SORT OF BOOKTHAT HE COULD LAY HIS HANDS ON IF IT WERE RASSELAS OR GULLIVER SOMUCH THE BETTER BUT BAILEYS DICTIONARY WOULD DO OR THE BIBLE WITHTHE APOCRYPHA IN IT
 SOMETHING HE MUST READ WHEN HE WAS NOT RIDING THEPONY OR RUNNING AND HUNTING OR LISTENING TO THE TALK OF MEN
 ALL THISWAS TRUE OF HIM AT TEN YEARS OF AGE HE HAD THEN READ THROUGH CHRYSALOR THE ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA WHICH WAS NEITHER MILK FOR BABES NORANY CHALKY MIXTURE MEANT TO PASS FOR MILK AND IT HAD ALREADY OCCURREDTO HIM THAT BOOKS WERE STUFF AND THAT LIFE WAS STUPID
 HIS SCHOOLSTUDIES HAD NOT MUCH MODIFIED THAT OPINION FOR THOUGH HE DID HISCLASSICS AND MATHEMATICS HE WAS NOT PREEMINENT IN THEM
 IT WAS SAIDOF HIM THAT LYDGATE COULD DO ANYTHING HE LIKED BUT HE HAD CERTAINLYNOT YET LIKED TO DO ANYTHING REMARKABLE
 HE WAS A VIGOROUS ANIMAL WITHA READY UNDERSTANDING BUT NO SPARK HAD YET KINDLED IN HIM ANINTELLECTUAL PASSION KNOWLEDGE SEEMED TO HIM A VERY SUPERFICIALAFFAIR EASILY MASTERED JUDGING FROM THE CONVERSATION OF HIS ELDERSHE HAD APPARENTLY GOT ALREADY MORE THAN WAS NECESSARY FOR MATURE LIFE
PROBABLY THIS WAS NOT AN EXCEPTIONAL RESULT OF EXPENSIVE TEACHING ATTHAT PERIOD OF SHORTWAISTED COATS AND OTHER FASHIONS WHICH HAVE NOTYET RECURRED
 BUT ONE VACATION A WET DAY SENT HIM TO THE SMALL HOMELIBRARY TO HUNT ONCE MORE FOR A BOOK WHICH MIGHT HAVE SOME FRESHNESSFOR HIM IN VAIN
 UNLESS INDEED HE TOOK DOWN A DUSTY ROW OF VOLUMESWITH GRAYPAPER BACKS AND DINGY LABELSTHE VOLUMES OF AN OLDCYCLOPAEDIA WHICH HE HAD NEVER DISTURBED
 IT WOULD AT LEAST BE ANOVELTY TO DISTURB THEM
 THEY WERE ON THE HIGHEST SHELF AND HE STOODON A CHAIR TO GET THEM DOWN
 BUT HE OPENED THE VOLUME WHICH HE FIRSTTOOK FROM THE SHELF SOMEHOW ONE IS APT TO READ IN A MAKESHIFTATTITUDE JUST WHERE IT MIGHT SEEM INCONVENIENT TO DO SO
 THE PAGE HEOPENED ON WAS UNDER THE HEAD OF ANATOMY AND THE FIRST PASSAGE THATDREW HIS EYES WAS ON THE VALVES OF THE HEART
 HE WAS NOT MUCHACQUAINTED WITH VALVES OF ANY SORT BUT HE KNEW THAT VALVAE WEREFOLDINGDOORS AND THROUGH THIS CREVICE CAME A SUDDEN LIGHT STARTLINGHIM WITH HIS FIRST VIVID NOTION OF FINELY ADJUSTED MECHANISM IN THEHUMAN FRAME
 A LIBERAL EDUCATION HAD OF COURSE LEFT HIM FREE TO READTHE INDECENT PASSAGES IN THE SCHOOL CLASSICS BUT BEYOND A GENERALSENSE OF SECRECY AND OBSCENITY IN CONNECTION WITH HIS INTERNALSTRUCTURE HAD LEFT HIS IMAGINATION QUITE UNBIASSED SO THAT FORANYTHING HE KNEW HIS BRAINS LAY IN SMALL BAGS AT HIS TEMPLES AND HEHAD NO MORE THOUGHT OF REPRESENTING TO HIMSELF HOW HIS BLOOD CIRCULATEDTHAN HOW PAPER SERVED INSTEAD OF GOLD
 BUT THE MOMENT OF VOCATION HADCOME AND BEFORE HE GOT DOWN FROM HIS CHAIR THE WORLD WAS MADE NEW TOHIM BY A PRESENTIMENT OF ENDLESS PROCESSES FILLING THE VAST SPACESPLANKED OUT OF HIS SIGHT BY THAT WORDY IGNORANCE WHICH HE HAD SUPPOSEDTO BE KNOWLEDGE
 FROM THAT HOUR LYDGATE FELT THE GROWTH OF ANINTELLECTUAL PASSION
WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF TELLING OVER AND OVER AGAIN HOW A MAN COMES TOFALL IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN AND BE WEDDED TO HER OR ELSE BE FATALLYPARTED FROM HER
 IS IT DUE TO EXCESS OF POETRY OR OF STUPIDITY THAT WEARE NEVER WEARY OF DESCRIBING WHAT KING JAMES CALLED A WOMANS MAKDOMAND HER FAIRNESSE NEVER WEARY OF LISTENING TO THE TWANGING OF THE OLDTROUBADOUR STRINGS AND ARE COMPARATIVELY UNINTERESTED IN THAT OTHERKIND OF MAKDOM AND FAIRNESSE WHICH MUST BE WOOED WITH INDUSTRIOUSTHOUGHT AND PATIENT RENUNCIATION OF SMALL DESIRES
 IN THE STORY OF THISPASSION TOO THE DEVELOPMENT VARIES SOMETIMES IT IS THE GLORIOUSMARRIAGE SOMETIMES FRUSTRATION AND FINAL PARTING
 AND NOT SELDOM THECATASTROPHE IS BOUND UP WITH THE OTHER PASSION SUNG BY THETROUBADOURS
 FOR IN THE MULTITUDE OF MIDDLEAGED MEN WHO GO ABOUT THEIRVOCATIONS IN A DAILY COURSE DETERMINED FOR THEM MUCH IN THE SAME WAY ASTHE TIE OF THEIR CRAVATS THERE IS ALWAYS A GOOD NUMBER WHO ONCE MEANTTO SHAPE THEIR OWN DEEDS AND ALTER THE WORLD A LITTLE
 THE STORY OFTHEIR COMING TO BE SHAPEN AFTER THE AVERAGE AND FIT TO BE PACKED BY THEGROSS IS HARDLY EVER TOLD EVEN IN THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS FOR PERHAPSTHEIR ARDOR IN GENEROUS UNPAID TOIL COOLED AS IMPERCEPTIBLY AS THEARDOR OF OTHER YOUTHFUL LOVES TILL ONE DAY THEIR EARLIER SELF WALKEDLIKE A GHOST IN ITS OLD HOME AND MADE THE NEW FURNITURE GHASTLY
NOTHING IN THE WORLD MORE SUBTLE THAN THE PROCESS OF THEIR GRADUALCHANGE
 IN THE BEGINNING THEY INHALED IT UNKNOWINGLY YOU AND I MAYHAVE SENT SOME OF OUR BREATH TOWARDS INFECTING THEM WHEN WE UTTEREDOUR CONFORMING FALSITIES OR DREW OUR SILLY CONCLUSIONS OR PERHAPS ITCAME WITH THE VIBRATIONS FROM A WOMANS GLANCE
LYDGATE DID NOT MEAN TO BE ONE OF THOSE FAILURES AND THERE WAS THEBETTER HOPE OF HIM BECAUSE HIS SCIENTIFIC INTEREST SOON TOOK THE FORMOF A PROFESSIONAL ENTHUSIASM HE HAD A YOUTHFUL BELIEF IN HISBREADWINNING WORK NOT TO BE STIFLED BY THAT INITIATION IN MAKESHIFTCALLED HIS PRENTICE DAYS AND HE CARRIED TO HIS STUDIES IN LONDONEDINBURGH AND PARIS THE CONVICTION THAT THE MEDICAL PROFESSION AS ITMIGHT BE WAS THE FINEST IN THE WORLD PRESENTING THE MOST PERFECTINTERCHANGE BETWEEN SCIENCE AND ART OFFERING THE MOST DIRECT ALLIANCEBETWEEN INTELLECTUAL CONQUEST AND THE SOCIAL GOOD
 LYDGATES NATUREDEMANDED THIS COMBINATION HE WAS AN EMOTIONAL CREATURE WITH AFLESHANDBLOOD SENSE OF FELLOWSHIP WHICH WITHSTOOD ALL THEABSTRACTIONS OF SPECIAL STUDY
 HE CARED NOT ONLY FOR CASES BUT FORJOHN AND ELIZABETH ESPECIALLY ELIZABETH
THERE WAS ANOTHER ATTRACTION IN HIS PROFESSION IT WANTED REFORM ANDGAVE A MAN AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME INDIGNANT RESOLVE TO REJECT ITSVENAL DECORATIONS AND OTHER HUMBUG AND TO BE THE POSSESSOR OF GENUINETHOUGH UNDEMANDED QUALIFICATIONS
 HE WENT TO STUDY IN PARIS WITH THEDETERMINATION THAT WHEN HE CAME HOME AGAIN HE WOULD SETTLE IN SOMEPROVINCIAL TOWN AS A GENERAL PRACTITIONER AND RESIST THE IRRATIONALSEVERANCE BETWEEN MEDICAL AND SURGICAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE INTEREST OF HISOWN SCIENTIFIC PURSUITS AS WELL AS OF THE GENERAL ADVANCE HE WOULDKEEP AWAY FROM THE RANGE OF LONDON INTRIGUES JEALOUSIES AND SOCIALTRUCKLING AND WIN CELEBRITY HOWEVER SLOWLY AS JENNER HAD DONE BYTHE INDEPENDENT VALUE OF HIS WORK
 FOR IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THISWAS A DARK PERIOD AND IN SPITE OF VENERABLE COLLEGES WHICH USED GREATEFFORTS TO SECURE PURITY OF KNOWLEDGE BY MAKING IT SCARCE AND TOEXCLUDE ERROR BY A RIGID EXCLUSIVENESS IN RELATION TO FEES ANDAPPOINTMENTS IT HAPPENED THAT VERY IGNORANT YOUNG GENTLEMEN WEREPROMOTED IN TOWN AND MANY MORE GOT A LEGAL RIGHT TO PRACTISE OVERLARGE AREAS IN THE COUNTRY
 ALSO THE HIGH STANDARD HELD UP TO THEPUBLIC MIND BY THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS WHICH GAVE ITS PECULIARSANCTION TO THE EXPENSIVE AND HIGHLY RAREFIED MEDICAL INSTRUCTIONOBTAINED BY GRADUATES OF OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE DID NOT HINDER QUACKERYFROM HAVING AN EXCELLENT TIME OF IT FOR SINCE PROFESSIONAL PRACTICECHIEFLY CONSISTED IN GIVING A GREAT MANY DRUGS THE PUBLIC INFERREDTHAT IT MIGHT BE BETTER OFF WITH MORE DRUGS STILL IF THEY COULD ONLYBE GOT CHEAPLY AND HENCE SWALLOWED LARGE CUBIC MEASURES OF PHYSICPRESCRIBED BY UNSCRUPULOUS IGNORANCE WHICH HAD TAKEN NO DEGREES
CONSIDERING THAT STATISTICS HAD NOT YET EMBRACED A CALCULATION AS TOTHE NUMBER OF IGNORANT OR CANTING DOCTORS WHICH ABSOLUTELY MUST EXISTIN THE TEETH OF ALL CHANGES IT SEEMED TO LYDGATE THAT A CHANGE IN THEUNITS WAS THE MOST DIRECT MODE OF CHANGING THE NUMBERS
 HE MEANT TO BEA UNIT WHO WOULD MAKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE TOWARDS THATSPREADING CHANGE WHICH WOULD ONE DAY TELL APPRECIABLY UPON THEAVERAGES AND IN THE MEAN TIME HAVE THE PLEASURE OF MAKING ANADVANTAGEOUS DIFFERENCE TO THE VISCERA OF HIS OWN PATIENTS
 BUT HE DIDNOT SIMPLY AIM AT A MORE GENUINE KIND OF PRACTICE THAN WAS COMMON
 HEWAS AMBITIOUS OF A WIDER EFFECT HE WAS FIRED WITH THE POSSIBILITY THATHE MIGHT WORK OUT THE PROOF OF AN ANATOMICAL CONCEPTION AND MAKE A LINKIN THE CHAIN OF DISCOVERY
DOES IT SEEM INCONGRUOUS TO YOU THAT A MIDDLEMARCH SURGEON SHOULD DREAMOF HIMSELF AS A DISCOVERER
 MOST OF US INDEED KNOW LITTLE OF THEGREAT ORIGINATORS UNTIL THEY HAVE BEEN LIFTED UP AMONG THECONSTELLATIONS AND ALREADY RULE OUR FATES
 BUT THAT HERSCHEL FOREXAMPLE WHO BROKE THE BARRIERS OF THE HEAVENSDID HE NOT ONCE PLAY APROVINCIAL CHURCHORGAN AND GIVE MUSICLESSONS TO STUMBLING PIANISTS
EACH OF THOSE SHINING ONES HAD TO WALK ON THE EARTH AMONG NEIGHBORS WHOPERHAPS THOUGHT MUCH MORE OF HIS GAIT AND HIS GARMENTS THAN OF ANYTHINGWHICH WAS TO GIVE HIM A TITLE TO EVERLASTING FAME EACH OF THEM HAD HISLITTLE LOCAL PERSONAL HISTORY SPRINKLED WITH SMALL TEMPTATIONS ANDSORDID CARES WHICH MADE THE RETARDING FRICTION OF HIS COURSE TOWARDSFINAL COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE IMMORTALS
 LYDGATE WAS NOT BLIND TO THEDANGERS OF SUCH FRICTION BUT HE HAD PLENTY OF CONFIDENCE IN HISRESOLUTION TO AVOID IT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE BEING SEVENANDTWENTY HEFELT HIMSELF EXPERIENCED
 AND HE WAS NOT GOING TO HAVE HIS VANITIESPROVOKED BY CONTACT WITH THE SHOWY WORLDLY SUCCESSES OF THE CAPITALBUT TO LIVE AMONG PEOPLE WHO COULD HOLD NO RIVALRY WITH THAT PURSUIT OFA GREAT IDEA WHICH WAS TO BE A TWIN OBJECT WITH THE ASSIDUOUS PRACTICEOF HIS PROFESSION
 THERE WAS FASCINATION IN THE HOPE THAT THE TWOPURPOSES WOULD ILLUMINATE EACH OTHER THE CAREFUL OBSERVATION ANDINFERENCE WHICH WAS HIS DAILY WORK THE USE OF THE LENS TO FURTHER HISJUDGMENT IN SPECIAL CASES WOULD FURTHER HIS THOUGHT AS AN INSTRUMENTOF LARGER INQUIRY
 WAS NOT THIS THE TYPICAL PREEMINENCE OF HISPROFESSION
 HE WOULD BE A GOOD MIDDLEMARCH DOCTOR AND BY THAT VERYMEANS KEEP HIMSELF IN THE TRACK OF FARREACHING INVESTIGATION
 ON ONEPOINT HE MAY FAIRLY CLAIM APPROVAL AT THIS PARTICULAR STAGE OF HISCAREER HE DID NOT MEAN TO IMITATE THOSE PHILANTHROPIC MODELS WHO MAKEA PROFIT OUT OF POISONOUS PICKLES TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES WHILE THEY AREEXPOSING ADULTERATION OR HOLD SHARES IN A GAMBLINGHELL THAT THEY MAYHAVE LEISURE TO REPRESENT THE CAUSE OF PUBLIC MORALITY
 HE INTENDED TOBEGIN IN HIS OWN CASE SOME PARTICULAR REFORMS WHICH WERE QUITECERTAINLY WITHIN HIS REACH AND MUCH LESS OF A PROBLEM THAN THEDEMONSTRATING OF AN ANATOMICAL CONCEPTION
 ONE OF THESE REFORMS WAS TOACT STOUTLY ON THE STRENGTH OF A RECENT LEGAL DECISION AND SIMPLYPRESCRIBE WITHOUT DISPENSING DRUGS OR TAKING PERCENTAGE FROMDRUGGISTS
 THIS WAS AN INNOVATION FOR ONE WHO HAD CHOSEN TO ADOPT THESTYLE OF GENERAL PRACTITIONER IN A COUNTRY TOWN AND WOULD BE FELT ASOFFENSIVE CRITICISM BY HIS PROFESSIONAL BRETHREN
 BUT LYDGATE MEANT TOINNOVATE IN HIS TREATMENT ALSO AND HE WAS WISE ENOUGH TO SEE THAT THEBEST SECURITY FOR HIS PRACTISING HONESTLY ACCORDING TO HIS BELIEF WASTO GET RID OF SYSTEMATIC TEMPTATIONS TO THE CONTRARY
PERHAPS THAT WAS A MORE CHEERFUL TIME FOR OBSERVERS AND THEORIZERS THANTHE PRESENT WE ARE APT TO THINK IT THE FINEST ERA OF THE WORLD WHENAMERICA WAS BEGINNING TO BE DISCOVERED WHEN A BOLD SAILOR EVEN IF HEWERE WRECKED MIGHT ALIGHT ON A NEW KINGDOM AND ABOUT  THE DARKTERRITORIES OF PATHOLOGY WERE A FINE AMERICA FOR A SPIRITED YOUNGADVENTURER
 LYDGATE WAS AMBITIOUS ABOVE ALL TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDSENLARGING THE SCIENTIFIC RATIONAL BASIS OF HIS PROFESSION
 THE MORE HEBECAME INTERESTED IN SPECIAL QUESTIONS OF DISEASE SUCH AS THE NATUREOF FEVER OR FEVERS THE MORE KEENLY HE FELT THE NEED FOR THATFUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE OF STRUCTURE WHICH JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF THECENTURY HAD BEEN ILLUMINATED BY THE BRIEF AND GLORIOUS CAREER OFBICHAT WHO DIED WHEN HE WAS ONLY ONEANDTHIRTY BUT LIKE ANOTHERALEXANDER LEFT A REALM LARGE ENOUGH FOR MANY HEIRS
 THAT GREATFRENCHMAN FIRST CARRIED OUT THE CONCEPTION THAT LIVING BODIESFUNDAMENTALLY CONSIDERED ARE NOT ASSOCIATIONS OF ORGANS WHICH CAN BEUNDERSTOOD BY STUDYING THEM FIRST APART AND THEN AS IT WERE FEDERALLYBUT MUST BE REGARDED AS CONSISTING OF CERTAIN PRIMARY WEBS OR TISSUESOUT OF WHICH THE VARIOUS ORGANSBRAIN HEART LUNGS AND SO ONARECOMPACTED AS THE VARIOUS ACCOMMODATIONS OF A HOUSE ARE BUILT UP INVARIOUS PROPORTIONS OF WOOD IRON STONE BRICK ZINC AND THE RESTEACH MATERIAL HAVING ITS PECULIAR COMPOSITION AND PROPORTIONS
 NO MANONE SEES CAN UNDERSTAND AND ESTIMATE THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OR ITSPARTSWHAT ARE ITS FRAILTIES AND WHAT ITS REPAIRS WITHOUT KNOWING THENATURE OF THE MATERIALS
 AND THE CONCEPTION WROUGHT OUT BY BICHAT WITHHIS DETAILED STUDY OF THE DIFFERENT TISSUES ACTED NECESSARILY ONMEDICAL QUESTIONS AS THE TURNING OF GASLIGHT WOULD ACT ON A DIMOILLIT STREET SHOWING NEW CONNECTIONS AND HITHERTO HIDDEN FACTS OFSTRUCTURE WHICH MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN CONSIDERING THE SYMPTOMSOF MALADIES AND THE ACTION OF MEDICAMENTS
 BUT RESULTS WHICH DEPEND ONHUMAN CONSCIENCE AND INTELLIGENCE WORK SLOWLY AND NOW AT THE END OF MOST MEDICAL PRACTICE WAS STILL STRUTTING OR SHAMBLING ALONG THEOLD PATHS AND THERE WAS STILL SCIENTIFIC WORK TO BE DONE WHICH MIGHTHAVE SEEMED TO BE A DIRECT SEQUENCE OF BICHATS
 THIS GREAT SEER DIDNOT GO BEYOND THE CONSIDERATION OF THE TISSUES AS ULTIMATE FACTS IN THELIVING ORGANISM MARKING THE LIMIT OF ANATOMICAL ANALYSIS BUT IT WASOPEN TO ANOTHER MIND TO SAY HAVE NOT THESE STRUCTURES SOME COMMONBASIS FROM WHICH THEY HAVE ALL STARTED AS YOUR SARSNET GAUZE NETSATIN AND VELVET FROM THE RAW COCOON
 HERE WOULD BE ANOTHER LIGHT ASOF OXYHYDROGEN SHOWING THE VERY GRAIN OF THINGS AND REVISING ALLFORMER EXPLANATIONS
 OF THIS SEQUENCE TO BICHATS WORK ALREADYVIBRATING ALONG MANY CURRENTS OF THE EUROPEAN MIND LYDGATE WASENAMOURED HE LONGED TO DEMONSTRATE THE MORE INTIMATE RELATIONS OFLIVING STRUCTURE AND HELP TO DEFINE MENS THOUGHT MORE ACCURATELYAFTER THE TRUE ORDER
 THE WORK HAD NOT YET BEEN DONE BUT ONLY PREPAREDFOR THOSE WHO KNEW HOW TO USE THE PREPARATION
 WHAT WAS THE PRIMITIVETISSUE
 IN THAT WAY LYDGATE PUT THE QUESTIONNOT QUITE IN THE WAYREQUIRED BY THE AWAITING ANSWER BUT SUCH MISSING OF THE RIGHT WORDBEFALLS MANY SEEKERS
 AND HE COUNTED ON QUIET INTERVALS TO BEWATCHFULLY SEIZED FOR TAKING UP THE THREADS OF INVESTIGATIONON MANYHINTS TO BE WON FROM DILIGENT APPLICATION NOT ONLY OF THE SCALPEL BUTOF THE MICROSCOPE WHICH RESEARCH HAD BEGUN TO USE AGAIN WITH NEWENTHUSIASM OF RELIANCE
 SUCH WAS LYDGATES PLAN OF HIS FUTURE TO DOGOOD SMALL WORK FOR MIDDLEMARCH AND GREAT WORK FOR THE WORLD
HE WAS CERTAINLY A HAPPY FELLOW AT THIS TIME TO BE SEVENANDTWENTYWITHOUT ANY FIXED VICES WITH A GENEROUS RESOLUTION THAT HIS ACTIONSHOULD BE BENEFICENT AND WITH IDEAS IN HIS BRAIN THAT MADE LIFEINTERESTING QUITE APART FROM THE CULTUS OF HORSEFLESH AND OTHER MYSTICRITES OF COSTLY OBSERVANCE WHICH THE EIGHT HUNDRED POUNDS LEFT HIMAFTER BUYING HIS PRACTICE WOULD CERTAINLY NOT HAVE GONE FAR IN PAYINGFOR
 HE WAS AT A STARTINGPOINT WHICH MAKES MANY A MANS CAREER A FINESUBJECT FOR BETTING IF THERE WERE ANY GENTLEMEN GIVEN TO THATAMUSEMENT WHO COULD APPRECIATE THE COMPLICATED PROBABILITIES OF ANARDUOUS PURPOSE WITH ALL THE POSSIBLE THWARTINGS AND FURTHERINGS OFCIRCUMSTANCE ALL THE NICETIES OF INWARD BALANCE BY WHICH A MAN SWIMSAND MAKES HIS POINT OR ELSE IS CARRIED HEADLONG
 THE RISK WOULD REMAINEVEN WITH CLOSE KNOWLEDGE OF LYDGATES CHARACTER FOR CHARACTER TOO ISA PROCESS AND AN UNFOLDING
 THE MAN WAS STILL IN THE MAKING AS MUCH ASTHE MIDDLEMARCH DOCTOR AND IMMORTAL DISCOVERER AND THERE WERE BOTHVIRTUES AND FAULTS CAPABLE OF SHRINKING OR EXPANDING
 THE FAULTS WILLNOT I HOPE BE A REASON FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF YOUR INTEREST IN HIM
AMONG OUR VALUED FRIENDS IS THERE NOT SOME ONE OR OTHER WHO IS A LITTLETOO SELFCONFIDENT AND DISDAINFUL WHOSE DISTINGUISHED MIND IS A LITTLESPOTTED WITH COMMONNESS WHO IS A LITTLE PINCHED HERE AND PROTUBERANTTHERE WITH NATIVE PREJUDICES OR WHOSE BETTER ENERGIES ARE LIABLE TOLAPSE DOWN THE WRONG CHANNEL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF TRANSIENTSOLICITATIONS
 ALL THESE THINGS MIGHT BE ALLEGED AGAINST LYDGATE BUTTHEN THEY ARE THE PERIPHRASES OF A POLITE PREACHER WHO TALKS OF ADAMAND WOULD NOT LIKE TO MENTION ANYTHING PAINFUL TO THE PEWRENTERS
 THEPARTICULAR FAULTS FROM WHICH THESE DELICATE GENERALITIES ARE DISTILLEDHAVE DISTINGUISHABLE PHYSIOGNOMIES DICTION ACCENT AND GRIMACESFILLING UP PARTS IN VERY VARIOUS DRAMAS
 OUR VANITIES DIFFER AS OURNOSES DO ALL CONCEIT IS NOT THE SAME CONCEIT BUT VARIES INCORRESPONDENCE WITH THE MINUTIAE OF MENTAL MAKE IN WHICH ONE OF USDIFFERS FROM ANOTHER
 LYDGATES CONCEIT WAS OF THE ARROGANT SORT NEVERSIMPERING NEVER IMPERTINENT BUT MASSIVE IN ITS CLAIMS ANDBENEVOLENTLY CONTEMPTUOUS
 HE WOULD DO A GREAT DEAL FOR NOODLES BEINGSORRY FOR THEM AND FEELING QUITE SURE THAT THEY COULD HAVE NO POWEROVER HIM HE HAD THOUGHT OF JOINING THE SAINT SIMONIANS WHEN HE WAS INPARIS IN ORDER TO TURN THEM AGAINST SOME OF THEIR OWN DOCTRINES
 ALLHIS FAULTS WERE MARKED BY KINDRED TRAITS AND WERE THOSE OF A MAN WHOHAD A FINE BARITONE WHOSE CLOTHES HUNG WELL UPON HIM AND WHO EVEN INHIS ORDINARY GESTURES HAD AN AIR OF INBRED DISTINCTION
 WHERE THEN LAYTHE SPOTS OF COMMONNESS
 SAYS A YOUNG LADY ENAMOURED OF THAT CARELESSGRACE
 HOW COULD THERE BE ANY COMMONNESS IN A MAN SO WELLBRED SOAMBITIOUS OF SOCIAL DISTINCTION SO GENEROUS AND UNUSUAL IN HIS VIEWSOF SOCIAL DUTY
 AS EASILY AS THERE MAY BE STUPIDITY IN A MAN OF GENIUSIF YOU TAKE HIM UNAWARES ON THE WRONG SUBJECT OR AS MANY A MAN WHO HASTHE BEST WILL TO ADVANCE THE SOCIAL MILLENNIUM MIGHT BE ILLINSPIRED INIMAGINING ITS LIGHTER PLEASURES UNABLE TO GO BEYOND OFFENBACHS MUSICOR THE BRILLIANT PUNNING IN THE LAST BURLESQUE
 LYDGATES SPOTS OFCOMMONNESS LAY IN THE COMPLEXION OF HIS PREJUDICES WHICH IN SPITE OFNOBLE INTENTION AND SYMPATHY WERE HALF OF THEM SUCH AS ARE FOUND INORDINARY MEN OF THE WORLD THAT DISTINCTION OF MIND WHICH BELONGED TOHIS INTELLECTUAL ARDOR DID NOT PENETRATE HIS FEELING AND JUDGMENTABOUT FURNITURE OR WOMEN OR THE DESIRABILITY OF ITS BEING KNOWNWITHOUT HIS TELLING THAT HE WAS BETTER BORN THAN OTHER COUNTRYSURGEONS
 HE DID NOT MEAN TO THINK OF FURNITURE AT PRESENT BUTWHENEVER HE DID SO IT WAS TO BE FEARED THAT NEITHER BIOLOGY NOR SCHEMESOF REFORM WOULD LIFT HIM ABOVE THE VULGARITY OF FEELING THAT THEREWOULD BE AN INCOMPATIBILITY IN HIS FURNITURE NOT BEING OF THE BEST
AS TO WOMEN HE HAD ONCE ALREADY BEEN DRAWN HEADLONG BY IMPETUOUSFOLLY WHICH HE MEANT TO BE FINAL SINCE MARRIAGE AT SOME DISTANTPERIOD WOULD OF COURSE NOT BE IMPETUOUS
 FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO BEACQUAINTED WITH LYDGATE IT WILL BE GOOD TO KNOW WHAT WAS THAT CASE OFIMPETUOUS FOLLY FOR IT MAY STAND AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE FITFUL SWERVINGOF PASSION TO WHICH HE WAS PRONE TOGETHER WITH THE CHIVALROUS KINDNESSWHICH HELPED TO MAKE HIM MORALLY LOVABLE
 THE STORY CAN BE TOLD WITHOUTMANY WORDS
 IT HAPPENED WHEN HE WAS STUDYING IN PARIS AND JUST AT THETIME WHEN OVER AND ABOVE HIS OTHER WORK HE WAS OCCUPIED WITH SOMEGALVANIC EXPERIMENTS
 ONE EVENING TIRED WITH HIS EXPERIMENTING ANDNOT BEING ABLE TO ELICIT THE FACTS HE NEEDED HE LEFT HIS FROGS ANDRABBITS TO SOME REPOSE UNDER THEIR TRYING AND MYSTERIOUS DISPENSATIONOF UNEXPLAINED SHOCKS AND WENT TO FINISH HIS EVENING AT THE THEATRE OFTHE PORTE SAINT MARTIN WHERE THERE WAS A MELODRAMA WHICH HE HADALREADY SEEN SEVERAL TIMES ATTRACTED NOT BY THE INGENIOUS WORK OF THECOLLABORATING AUTHORS BUT BY AN ACTRESS WHOSE PART IT WAS TO STAB HERLOVER MISTAKING HIM FOR THE EVILDESIGNING DUKE OF THE PIECE
 LYDGATEWAS IN LOVE WITH THIS ACTRESS AS A MAN IS IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN WHOM HENEVER EXPECTS TO SPEAK TO
 SHE WAS A PROVENCALE WITH DARK EYES AGREEK PROFILE AND ROUNDED MAJESTIC FORM HAVING THAT SORT OF BEAUTYWHICH CARRIES A SWEET MATRONLINESS EVEN IN YOUTH AND HER VOICE WAS ASOFT COOING
 SHE HAD BUT LATELY COME TO PARIS AND BORE A VIRTUOUSREPUTATION HER HUSBAND ACTING WITH HER AS THE UNFORTUNATE LOVER
 ITWAS HER ACTING WHICH WAS NO BETTER THAN IT SHOULD BE BUT THE PUBLICWAS SATISFIED
 LYDGATES ONLY RELAXATION NOW WAS TO GO AND LOOK AT THISWOMAN JUST AS HE MIGHT HAVE THROWN HIMSELF UNDER THE BREATH OF THESWEET SOUTH ON A BANK OF VIOLETS FOR A WHILE WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO HISGALVANISM TO WHICH HE WOULD PRESENTLY RETURN
 BUT THIS EVENING THE OLDDRAMA HAD A NEW CATASTROPHE
 AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE HEROINE WAS TO ACTTHE STABBING OF HER LOVER AND HE WAS TO FALL GRACEFULLY THE WIFEVERITABLY STABBED HER HUSBAND WHO FELL AS DEATH WILLED
 A WILD SHRIEKPIERCED THE HOUSE AND THE PROVENCALE FELL SWOONING A SHRIEK AND ASWOON WERE DEMANDED BY THE PLAY BUT THE SWOONING TOO WAS REAL THISTIME
 LYDGATE LEAPED AND CLIMBED HE HARDLY KNEW HOW ON TO THE STAGEAND WAS ACTIVE IN HELP MAKING THE ACQUAINTANCE OF HIS HEROINE BYFINDING A CONTUSION ON HER HEAD AND LIFTING HER GENTLY IN HIS ARMS
PARIS RANG WITH THE STORY OF THIS DEATHWAS IT A MURDER
 SOME OF THEACTRESSS WARMEST ADMIRERS WERE INCLINED TO BELIEVE IN HER GUILT ANDLIKED HER THE BETTER FOR IT SUCH WAS THE TASTE OF THOSE TIMES BUTLYDGATE WAS NOT ONE OF THESE
 HE VEHEMENTLY CONTENDED FOR HERINNOCENCE AND THE REMOTE IMPERSONAL PASSION FOR HER BEAUTY WHICH HEHAD FELT BEFORE HAD PASSED NOW INTO PERSONAL DEVOTION AND TENDERTHOUGHT OF HER LOT
 THE NOTION OF MURDER WAS ABSURD NO MOTIVE WASDISCOVERABLE THE YOUNG COUPLE BEING UNDERSTOOD TO DOTE ON EACH OTHERAND IT WAS NOT UNPRECEDENTED THAT AN ACCIDENTAL SLIP OF THE FOOT SHOULDHAVE BROUGHT THESE GRAVE CONSEQUENCES
 THE LEGAL INVESTIGATION ENDED INMADAME LAURES RELEASE
 LYDGATE BY THIS TIME HAD HAD MANY INTERVIEWSWITH HER AND FOUND HER MORE AND MORE ADORABLE
 SHE TALKED LITTLE BUTTHAT WAS AN ADDITIONAL CHARM
 SHE WAS MELANCHOLY AND SEEMED GRATEFULHER PRESENCE WAS ENOUGH LIKE THAT OF THE EVENING LIGHT
 LYDGATE WASMADLY ANXIOUS ABOUT HER AFFECTION AND JEALOUS LEST ANY OTHER MAN THANHIMSELF SHOULD WIN IT AND ASK HER TO MARRY HIM
 BUT INSTEAD OFREOPENING HER ENGAGEMENT AT THE PORTE SAINT MARTIN WHERE SHE WOULDHAVE BEEN ALL THE MORE POPULAR FOR THE FATAL EPISODE SHE LEFT PARISWITHOUT WARNING FORSAKING HER LITTLE COURT OF ADMIRERS
 PERHAPS NO ONECARRIED INQUIRY FAR EXCEPT LYDGATE WHO FELT THAT ALL SCIENCE HAD COMETO A STANDSTILL WHILE HE IMAGINED THE UNHAPPY LAURE STRICKEN BYEVERWANDERING SORROW HERSELF WANDERING AND FINDING NO FAITHFULCOMFORTER
 HIDDEN ACTRESSES HOWEVER ARE NOT SO DIFFICULT TO FIND ASSOME OTHER HIDDEN FACTS AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE LYDGATE GATHEREDINDICATIONS THAT LAURE HAD TAKEN THE ROUTE TO LYONS
 HE FOUND HER ATLAST ACTING WITH GREAT SUCCESS AT AVIGNON UNDER THE SAME NAME LOOKINGMORE MAJESTIC THAN EVER AS A FORSAKEN WIFE CARRYING HER CHILD IN HERARMS
 HE SPOKE TO HER AFTER THE PLAY WAS RECEIVED WITH THE USUALQUIETUDE WHICH SEEMED TO HIM BEAUTIFUL AS CLEAR DEPTHS OF WATER ANDOBTAINED LEAVE TO VISIT HER THE NEXT DAY WHEN HE WAS BENT ON TELLINGHER THAT HE ADORED HER AND ON ASKING HER TO MARRY HIM
 HE KNEW THATTHIS WAS LIKE THE SUDDEN IMPULSE OF A MADMANINCONGRUOUS EVEN WITH HISHABITUAL FOIBLES
 NO MATTER
 IT WAS THE ONE THING WHICH HE WAS RESOLVEDTO DO
 HE HAD TWO SELVES WITHIN HIM APPARENTLY AND THEY MUST LEARN TOACCOMMODATE EACH OTHER AND BEAR RECIPROCAL IMPEDIMENTS
 STRANGE THATSOME OF US WITH QUICK ALTERNATE VISION SEE BEYOND OUR INFATUATIONSAND EVEN WHILE WE RAVE ON THE HEIGHTS BEHOLD THE WIDE PLAIN WHERE OURPERSISTENT SELF PAUSES AND AWAITS US
TO HAVE APPROACHED LAURE WITH ANY SUIT THAT WAS NOT REVERENTIALLYTENDER WOULD HAVE BEEN SIMPLY A CONTRADICTION OF HIS WHOLE FEELINGTOWARDS HER
YOU HAVE COME ALL THE WAY FROM PARIS TO FIND ME
 SHE SAID TO HIM THENEXT DAY SITTING BEFORE HIM WITH FOLDED ARMS AND LOOKING AT HIM WITHEYES THAT SEEMED TO WONDER AS AN UNTAMED RUMINATING ANIMAL WONDERS
ARE ALL ENGLISHMEN LIKE THAT
I CAME BECAUSE I COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT TRYING TO SEE YOU
 YOU ARELONELY I LOVE YOU I WANT YOU TO CONSENT TO BE MY WIFE I WILL WAITBUT I WANT YOU TO PROMISE THAT YOU WILL MARRY MENO ONE ELSE
LAURE LOOKED AT HIM IN SILENCE WITH A MELANCHOLY RADIANCE FROM UNDERHER GRAND EYELIDS UNTIL HE WAS FULL OF RAPTUROUS CERTAINTY AND KNELTCLOSE TO HER KNEES
I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING SHE SAID IN HER COOING WAY KEEPING HERARMS FOLDED
 MY FOOT REALLY SLIPPED
I KNOW I KNOW SAID LYDGATE DEPRECATINGLY
 IT WAS A FATALACCIDENTA DREADFUL STROKE OF CALAMITY THAT BOUND ME TO YOU THE MORE
AGAIN LAURE PAUSED A LITTLE AND THEN SAID SLOWLY I MEANT TO DOIT
LYDGATE STRONG MAN AS HE WAS TURNED PALE AND TREMBLED MOMENTS SEEMEDTO PASS BEFORE HE ROSE AND STOOD AT A DISTANCE FROM HER
THERE WAS A SECRET THEN HE SAID AT LAST EVEN VEHEMENTLY
 HE WASBRUTAL TO YOU YOU HATED HIM
NO
 HE WEARIED ME HE WAS TOO FOND HE WOULD LIVE IN PARIS AND NOT INMY COUNTRY THAT WAS NOT AGREEABLE TO ME
GREAT GOD
 SAID LYDGATE IN A GROAN OF HORROR
 AND YOU PLANNED TOMURDER HIM
I DID NOT PLAN IT CAME TO ME IN THE PLAYI MEANT TO DO IT
LYDGATE STOOD MUTE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY PRESSED HIS HAT ON WHILE HELOOKED AT HER
 HE SAW THIS WOMANTHE FIRST TO WHOM HE HAD GIVEN HISYOUNG ADORATIONAMID THE THRONG OF STUPID CRIMINALS
YOU ARE A GOOD YOUNG MAN SHE SAID
 BUT I DO NOT LIKE HUSBANDS
 IWILL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER
THREE DAYS AFTERWARDS LYDGATE WAS AT HIS GALVANISM AGAIN IN HIS PARISCHAMBERS BELIEVING THAT ILLUSIONS WERE AT AN END FOR HIM
 HE WAS SAVEDFROM HARDENING EFFECTS BY THE ABUNDANT KINDNESS OF HIS HEART AND HISBELIEF THAT HUMAN LIFE MIGHT BE MADE BETTER
 BUT HE HAD MORE REASONTHAN EVER FOR TRUSTING HIS JUDGMENT NOW THAT IT WAS SO EXPERIENCEDAND HENCEFORTH HE WOULD TAKE A STRICTLY SCIENTIFIC VIEW OF WOMANENTERTAINING NO EXPECTATIONS BUT SUCH AS WERE JUSTIFIED BEFOREHAND
NO ONE IN MIDDLEMARCH WAS LIKELY TO HAVE SUCH A NOTION OF LYDGATESPAST AS HAS HERE BEEN FAINTLY SHADOWED AND INDEED THE RESPECTABLETOWNSFOLK THERE WERE NOT MORE GIVEN THAN MORTALS GENERALLY TO ANY EAGERATTEMPT AT EXACTNESS IN THE REPRESENTATION TO THEMSELVES OF WHAT DIDNOT COME UNDER THEIR OWN SENSES
 NOT ONLY YOUNG VIRGINS OF THAT TOWNBUT GRAYBEARDED MEN ALSO WERE OFTEN IN HASTE TO CONJECTURE HOW A NEWACQUAINTANCE MIGHT BE WROUGHT INTO THEIR PURPOSES CONTENTED WITH VERYVAGUE KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE WAY IN WHICH LIFE HAD BEEN SHAPING HIM FORTHAT INSTRUMENTALITY
 MIDDLEMARCH IN FACT COUNTED ON SWALLOWINGLYDGATE AND ASSIMILATING HIM VERY COMFORTABLY
CHAPTER XVI
ALL THAT IN WOMAN IS ADORED    IN THY FAIR SELF I FINDFOR THE WHOLE SEX CAN BUT AFFORD    THE HANDSOME AND THE KIND
SIR CHARLES SEDLEY
THE QUESTION WHETHER MR
 TYKE SHOULD BE APPOINTED AS SALARIED CHAPLAINTO THE HOSPITAL WAS AN EXCITING TOPIC TO THE MIDDLEMARCHERS ANDLYDGATE HEARD IT DISCUSSED IN A WAY THAT THREW MUCH LIGHT ON THE POWEREXERCISED IN THE TOWN BY MR
 BULSTRODE
 THE BANKER WAS EVIDENTLY ARULER BUT THERE WAS AN OPPOSITION PARTY AND EVEN AMONG HIS SUPPORTERSTHERE WERE SOME WHO ALLOWED IT TO BE SEEN THAT THEIR SUPPORT WAS ACOMPROMISE AND WHO FRANKLY STATED THEIR IMPRESSION THAT THE GENERALSCHEME OF THINGS AND ESPECIALLY THE CASUALTIES OF TRADE REQUIRED YOUTO HOLD A CANDLE TO THE DEVIL
MR
 BULSTRODES POWER WAS NOT DUE SIMPLY TO HIS BEING A COUNTRY BANKERWHO KNEW THE FINANCIAL SECRETS OF MOST TRADERS IN THE TOWN AND COULDTOUCH THE SPRINGS OF THEIR CREDIT IT WAS FORTIFIED BY A BENEFICENCETHAT WAS AT ONCE READY AND SEVEREREADY TO CONFER OBLIGATIONS ANDSEVERE IN WATCHING THE RESULT
 HE HAD GATHERED AS AN INDUSTRIOUS MANALWAYS AT HIS POST A CHIEF SHARE IN ADMINISTERING THE TOWN CHARITIESAND HIS PRIVATE CHARITIES WERE BOTH MINUTE AND ABUNDANT
 HE WOULD TAKEA GREAT DEAL OF PAINS ABOUT APPRENTICING TEGG THE SHOEMAKERS SON ANDHE WOULD WATCH OVER TEGGS CHURCHGOING HE WOULD DEFEND MRS
 STRYPETHE WASHERWOMAN AGAINST STUBBSS UNJUST EXACTION ON THE SCORE OF HERDRYINGGROUND AND HE WOULD HIMSELF SCRUTINIZE A CALUMNY AGAINST MRS
STRYPE
 HIS PRIVATE MINOR LOANS WERE NUMEROUS BUT HE WOULD INQUIRESTRICTLY INTO THE CIRCUMSTANCES BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER
 IN THIS WAY AMAN GATHERS A DOMAIN IN HIS NEIGHBORS HOPE AND FEAR AS WELL ASGRATITUDE AND POWER WHEN ONCE IT HAS GOT INTO THAT SUBTLE REGIONPROPAGATES ITSELF SPREADING OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO ITS EXTERNALMEANS
 IT WAS A PRINCIPLE WITH MR
 BULSTRODE TO GAIN AS MUCH POWER ASPOSSIBLE THAT HE MIGHT USE IT FOR THE GLORY OF GOD
 HE WENT THROUGH AGREAT DEAL OF SPIRITUAL CONFLICT AND INWARD ARGUMENT IN ORDER TO ADJUSTHIS MOTIVES AND MAKE CLEAR TO HIMSELF WHAT GODS GLORY REQUIRED
 BUTAS WE HAVE SEEN HIS MOTIVES WERE NOT ALWAYS RIGHTLY APPRECIATED
 THEREWERE MANY CRASS MINDS IN MIDDLEMARCH WHOSE REFLECTIVE SCALES COULD ONLYWEIGH THINGS IN THE LUMP AND THEY HAD A STRONG SUSPICION THAT SINCEMR
 BULSTRODE COULD NOT ENJOY LIFE IN THEIR FASHION EATING ANDDRINKING SO LITTLE AS HE DID AND WORRETING HIMSELF ABOUT EVERYTHINGHE MUST HAVE A SORT OF VAMPIRES FEAST IN THE SENSE OF MASTERY
THE SUBJECT OF THE CHAPLAINCY CAME UP AT MR
 VINCYS TABLE WHEN LYDGATEWAS DINING THERE AND THE FAMILY CONNECTION WITH MR
 BULSTRODE DID NOTHE OBSERVED PREVENT SOME FREEDOM OF REMARK EVEN ON THE PART OF THEHOST HIMSELF THOUGH HIS REASONS AGAINST THE PROPOSED ARRANGEMENTTURNED ENTIRELY ON HIS OBJECTION TO MR
 TYKES SERMONS WHICH WERE ALLDOCTRINE AND HIS PREFERENCE FOR MR
 FAREBROTHER WHOSE SERMONS WEREFREE FROM THAT TAINT
 MR
 VINCY LIKED WELL ENOUGH THE NOTION OF THECHAPLAINS HAVING A SALARY SUPPOSING IT WERE GIVEN TO FAREBROTHER WHOWAS AS GOOD A LITTLE FELLOW AS EVER BREATHED AND THE BEST PREACHERANYWHERE AND COMPANIONABLE TOO
WHAT LINE SHALL YOU TAKE THEN
 SAID MR
 CHICHELY THE CORONER AGREAT COURSING COMRADE OF MR
 VINCYS
OH IM PRECIOUS GLAD IM NOT ONE OF THE DIRECTORS NOW
 I SHALL VOTEFOR REFERRING THE MATTER TO THE DIRECTORS AND THE MEDICAL BOARDTOGETHER
 I SHALL ROLL SOME OF MY RESPONSIBILITY ON YOUR SHOULDERSDOCTOR SAID MR
 VINCY GLANCING FIRST AT DR
 SPRAGUE THE SENIORPHYSICIAN OF THE TOWN AND THEN AT LYDGATE WHO SAT OPPOSITE
 YOUMEDICAL GENTLEMEN MUST CONSULT WHICH SORT OF BLACK DRAUGHT YOU WILLPRESCRIBE EH MR
 LYDGATE
I KNOW LITTLE OF EITHER SAID LYDGATE BUT IN GENERAL APPOINTMENTSARE APT TO BE MADE TOO MUCH A QUESTION OF PERSONAL LIKING
 THE FITTESTMAN FOR A PARTICULAR POST IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST FELLOW OR THE MOSTAGREEABLE
 SOMETIMES IF YOU WANTED TO GET A REFORM YOUR ONLY WAYWOULD BE TO PENSION OFF THE GOOD FELLOWS WHOM EVERYBODY IS FOND OF ANDPUT THEM OUT OF THE QUESTION
DR
 SPRAGUE WHO WAS CONSIDERED THE PHYSICIAN OF MOST WEIGHT THOUGHDR
 MINCHIN WAS USUALLY SAID TO HAVE MORE PENETRATION DIVESTED HISLARGE HEAVY FACE OF ALL EXPRESSION AND LOOKED AT HIS WINEGLASS WHILELYDGATE WAS SPEAKING
 WHATEVER WAS NOT PROBLEMATICAL AND SUSPECTEDABOUT THIS YOUNG MANFOR EXAMPLE A CERTAIN SHOWINESS AS TO FOREIGNIDEAS AND A DISPOSITION TO UNSETTLE WHAT HAD BEEN SETTLED ANDFORGOTTEN BY HIS ELDERSWAS POSITIVELY UNWELCOME TO A PHYSICIAN WHOSESTANDING HAD BEEN FIXED THIRTY YEARS BEFORE BY A TREATISE ONMENINGITIS OF WHICH AT LEAST ONE COPY MARKED OWN WAS BOUND IN CALF
FOR MY PART I HAVE SOME FELLOWFEELING WITH DR
 SPRAGUE ONESSELFSATISFACTION IS AN UNTAXED KIND OF PROPERTY WHICH IT IS VERYUNPLEASANT TO FIND DEPRECATED
LYDGATES REMARK HOWEVER DID NOT MEET THE SENSE OF THE COMPANY
 MR
VINCY SAID THAT IF HE COULD HAVE HIS WAY HE WOULD NOT PUTDISAGREEABLE FELLOWS ANYWHERE
HANG YOUR REFORMS
 SAID MR
 CHICHELY
 THERES NO GREATER HUMBUG INTHE WORLD
 YOU NEVER HEAR OF A REFORM BUT IT MEANS SOME TRICK TO PUTIN NEW MEN
 I HOPE YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THE LANCETS MEN MR
LYDGATEWANTING TO TAKE THE CORONERSHIP OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE LEGALPROFESSION YOUR WORDS APPEAR TO POINT THAT WAY
I DISAPPROVE OF WAKLEY INTERPOSED DR
 SPRAGUE NO MAN MORE HE ISAN ILLINTENTIONED FELLOW WHO WOULD SACRIFICE THE RESPECTABILITY OFTHE PROFESSION WHICH EVERYBODY KNOWS DEPENDS ON THE LONDON COLLEGESFOR THE SAKE OF GETTING SOME NOTORIETY FOR HIMSELF
 THERE ARE MEN WHODONT MIND ABOUT BEING KICKED BLUE IF THEY CAN ONLY GET TALKED ABOUT
BUT WAKLEY IS RIGHT SOMETIMES THE DOCTOR ADDED JUDICIALLY
 I COULDMENTION ONE OR TWO POINTS IN WHICH WAKLEY IS IN THE RIGHT
OH WELL SAID MR
 CHICHELY I BLAME NO MAN FOR STANDING UP IN FAVOROF HIS OWN CLOTH BUT COMING TO ARGUMENT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW ACORONER IS TO JUDGE OF EVIDENCE IF HE HAS NOT HAD A LEGAL TRAINING
IN MY OPINION SAID LYDGATE LEGAL TRAINING ONLY MAKES A MAN MOREINCOMPETENT IN QUESTIONS THAT REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE OF ANOTHER KIND
 PEOPLETALK ABOUT EVIDENCE AS IF IT COULD REALLY BE WEIGHED IN SCALES BY ABLIND JUSTICE
 NO MAN CAN JUDGE WHAT IS GOOD EVIDENCE ON ANY PARTICULARSUBJECT UNLESS HE KNOWS THAT SUBJECT WELL
 A LAWYER IS NO BETTER THANAN OLD WOMAN AT A POSTMORTEM EXAMINATION
 HOW IS HE TO KNOW THE ACTIONOF A POISON
 YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY THAT SCANNING VERSE WILL TEACH YOUTO SCAN THE POTATO CROPS
YOU ARE AWARE I SUPPOSE THAT IT IS NOT THE CORONERS BUSINESS TOCONDUCT THE POSTMORTEM BUT ONLY TO TAKE THE EVIDENCE OF THE MEDICALWITNESS
 SAID MR
 CHICHELY WITH SOME SCORN
WHO IS OFTEN ALMOST AS IGNORANT AS THE CORONER HIMSELF SAID LYDGATE
QUESTIONS OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE OUGHT NOT TO BE LEFT TO THE CHANCEOF DECENT KNOWLEDGE IN A MEDICAL WITNESS AND THE CORONER OUGHT NOT TOBE A MAN WHO WILL BELIEVE THAT STRYCHNINE WILL DESTROY THE COATS OF THESTOMACH IF AN IGNORANT PRACTITIONER HAPPENS TO TELL HIM SO
LYDGATE HAD REALLY LOST SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT MR
 CHICHELY WAS HISMAJESTYS CORONER AND ENDED INNOCENTLY WITH THE QUESTION DONT YOUAGREE WITH ME DR
 SPRAGUE
TO A CERTAIN EXTENTWITH REGARD TO POPULOUS DISTRICTS AND IN THEMETROPOLIS SAID THE DOCTOR
 BUT I HOPE IT WILL BE LONG BEFORE THISPART OF THE COUNTRY LOSES THE SERVICES OF MY FRIEND CHICHELY EVENTHOUGH IT MIGHT GET THE BEST MAN IN OUR PROFESSION TO SUCCEED HIM
 I AMSURE VINCY WILL AGREE WITH ME
YES YES GIVE ME A CORONER WHO IS A GOOD COURSING MAN SAID MR
VINCY JOVIALLY
 AND IN MY OPINION YOURE SAFEST WITH A LAWYER
NOBODY CAN KNOW EVERYTHING
 MOST THINGS ARE VISITATION OF GOD
 AND ASTO POISONING WHY WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW IS THE LAW
 COME SHALL WEJOIN THE LADIES
LYDGATES PRIVATE OPINION WAS THAT MR
 CHICHELY MIGHT BE THE VERYCORONER WITHOUT BIAS AS TO THE COATS OF THE STOMACH BUT HE HAD NOTMEANT TO BE PERSONAL
 THIS WAS ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF MOVING INGOOD MIDDLEMARCH SOCIETY IT WAS DANGEROUS TO INSIST ON KNOWLEDGE AS AQUALIFICATION FOR ANY SALARIED OFFICE
 FRED VINCY HAD CALLED LYDGATE APRIG AND NOW MR
 CHICHELY WAS INCLINED TO CALL HIM PRICKEAREDESPECIALLY WHEN IN THE DRAWINGROOM HE SEEMED TO BE MAKING HIMSELFEMINENTLY AGREEABLE TO ROSAMOND WHOM HE HAD EASILY MONOPOLIZED IN ATÊTEÀTÊTE SINCE MRS
 VINCY HERSELF SAT AT THE TEATABLE
 SHERESIGNED NO DOMESTIC FUNCTION TO HER DAUGHTER AND THE MATRONSBLOOMING GOODNATURED FACE WITH THE TWO VOLATILE PINK STRINGS FLOATINGFROM HER FINE THROAT AND HER CHEERY MANNERS TO HUSBAND AND CHILDRENWAS CERTAINLY AMONG THE GREAT ATTRACTIONS OF THE VINCYHOUSEATTRACTIONS WHICH MADE IT ALL THE EASIER TO FALL IN LOVE WITH THEDAUGHTER
 THE TINGE OF UNPRETENTIOUS INOFFENSIVE VULGARITY IN MRS
VINCY GAVE MORE EFFECT TO ROSAMONDS REFINEMENT WHICH WAS BEYOND WHATLYDGATE HAD EXPECTED
CERTAINLY SMALL FEET AND PERFECTLY TURNED SHOULDERS AID THE IMPRESSIONOF REFINED MANNERS AND THE RIGHT THING SAID SEEMS QUITE ASTONISHINGLYRIGHT WHEN IT IS ACCOMPANIED WITH EXQUISITE CURVES OF LIP AND EYELID
AND ROSAMOND COULD SAY THE RIGHT THING FOR SHE WAS CLEVER WITH THATSORT OF CLEVERNESS WHICH CATCHES EVERY TONE EXCEPT THE HUMOROUS
HAPPILY SHE NEVER ATTEMPTED TO JOKE AND THIS PERHAPS WAS THE MOSTDECISIVE MARK OF HER CLEVERNESS
SHE AND LYDGATE READILY GOT INTO CONVERSATION
 HE REGRETTED THAT HE HADNOT HEARD HER SING THE OTHER DAY AT STONE COURT
 THE ONLY PLEASURE HEALLOWED HIMSELF DURING THE LATTER PART OF HIS STAY IN PARIS WAS TO GOAND HEAR MUSIC
YOU HAVE STUDIED MUSIC PROBABLY
 SAID ROSAMOND
NO I KNOW THE NOTES OF MANY BIRDS AND I KNOW MANY MELODIES BY EARBUT THE MUSIC THAT I DONT KNOW AT ALL AND HAVE NO NOTION ABOUTDELIGHTS MEAFFECTS ME
 HOW STUPID THE WORLD IS THAT IT DOES NOT MAKEMORE USE OF SUCH A PLEASURE WITHIN ITS REACH
YES AND YOU WILL FIND MIDDLEMARCH VERY TUNELESS
 THERE ARE HARDLY ANYGOOD MUSICIANS
 I ONLY KNOW TWO GENTLEMEN WHO SING AT ALL WELL
I SUPPOSE IT IS THE FASHION TO SING COMIC SONGS IN A RHYTHMIC WAYLEAVING YOU TO FANCY THE TUNEVERY MUCH AS IF IT WERE TAPPED ON ADRUM
AH YOU HAVE HEARD MR
 BOWYER SAID ROSAMOND WITH ONE OF HER RARESMILES
 BUT WE ARE SPEAKING VERY ILL OF OUR NEIGHBORS
LYDGATE WAS ALMOST FORGETTING THAT HE MUST CARRY ON THE CONVERSATIONIN THINKING HOW LOVELY THIS CREATURE WAS HER GARMENT SEEMING TO BEMADE OUT OF THE FAINTEST BLUE SKY HERSELF SO IMMACULATELY BLOND AS IFTHE PETALS OF SOME GIGANTIC FLOWER HAD JUST OPENED AND DISCLOSED HERAND YET WITH THIS INFANTINE BLONDNESS SHOWING SO MUCH READYSELFPOSSESSED GRACE
 SINCE HE HAD HAD THE MEMORY OF LAURE LYDGATE HADLOST ALL TASTE FOR LARGEEYED SILENCE THE DIVINE COW NO LONGERATTRACTED HIM AND ROSAMOND WAS HER VERY OPPOSITE
 BUT HE RECALLEDHIMSELF
YOU WILL LET ME HEAR SOME MUSIC TONIGHT I HOPE
I WILL LET YOU HEAR MY ATTEMPTS IF YOU LIKE SAID ROSAMOND
 PAPA ISSURE TO INSIST ON MY SINGING
 BUT I SHALL TREMBLE BEFORE YOU WHO HAVEHEARD THE BEST SINGERS IN PARIS
 I HAVE HEARD VERY LITTLE I HAVE ONLYONCE BEEN TO LONDON
 BUT OUR ORGANIST AT ST
 PETERS IS A GOODMUSICIAN AND I GO ON STUDYING WITH HIM
TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW IN LONDON
VERY LITTLE
 A MORE NAIVE GIRL WOULD HAVE SAID OH EVERYTHING
BUT ROSAMOND KNEW BETTER
 A FEW OF THE ORDINARY SIGHTS SUCH AS RAWCOUNTRY GIRLS ARE ALWAYS TAKEN TO
DO YOU CALL YOURSELF A RAW COUNTRY GIRL
 SAID LYDGATE LOOKING AT HERWITH AN INVOLUNTARY EMPHASIS OF ADMIRATION WHICH MADE ROSAMOND BLUSHWITH PLEASURE
 BUT SHE REMAINED SIMPLY SERIOUS TURNED HER LONG NECK ALITTLE AND PUT UP HER HAND TO TOUCH HER WONDROUS HAIRPLAITSANHABITUAL GESTURE WITH HER AS PRETTY AS ANY MOVEMENTS OF A KITTENS PAW
NOT THAT ROSAMOND WAS IN THE LEAST LIKE A KITTEN SHE WAS A SYLPHCAUGHT YOUNG AND EDUCATED AT MRS
 LEMONS
I ASSURE YOU MY MIND IS RAW SHE SAID IMMEDIATELY I PASS ATMIDDLEMARCH
 I AM NOT AFRAID OF TALKING TO OUR OLD NEIGHBORS
 BUT I AMREALLY AFRAID OF YOU
AN ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN ALMOST ALWAYS KNOWS MORE THAN WE MEN THOUGH HERKNOWLEDGE IS OF A DIFFERENT SORT
 I AM SURE YOU COULD TEACH ME ATHOUSAND THINGSAS AN EXQUISITE BIRD COULD TEACH A BEAR IF THERE WEREANY COMMON LANGUAGE BETWEEN THEM
 HAPPILY THERE IS A COMMON LANGUAGEBETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN AND SO THE BEARS CAN GET TAUGHT
AH THERE IS FRED BEGINNING TO STRUM
 I MUST GO AND HINDER HIM FROMJARRING ALL YOUR NERVES SAID ROSAMOND MOVING TO THE OTHER SIDE OFTHE ROOM WHERE FRED HAVING OPENED THE PIANO AT HIS FATHERS DESIRETHAT ROSAMOND MIGHT GIVE THEM SOME MUSIC WAS PARENTHETICALLYPERFORMING CHERRY RIPE
 WITH ONE HAND
 ABLE MEN WHO HAVE PASSED THEIREXAMINATIONS WILL DO THESE THINGS SOMETIMES NOT LESS THAN THE PLUCKEDFRED
FRED PRAY DEFER YOUR PRACTISING TILL TOMORROW YOU WILL MAKE MR
LYDGATE ILL SAID ROSAMOND
 HE HAS AN EAR
FRED LAUGHED AND WENT ON WITH HIS TUNE TO THE END
ROSAMOND TURNED TO LYDGATE SMILING GENTLY AND SAID YOU PERCEIVETHE BEARS WILL NOT ALWAYS BE TAUGHT
NOW THEN ROSY
 SAID FRED SPRINGING FROM THE STOOL AND TWISTING ITUPWARD FOR HER WITH A HEARTY EXPECTATION OF ENJOYMENT
 SOME GOODROUSING TUNES FIRST
ROSAMOND PLAYED ADMIRABLY
 HER MASTER AT MRS
 LEMONS SCHOOL CLOSE TOA COUNTY TOWN WITH A MEMORABLE HISTORY THAT HAD ITS RELICS IN CHURCHAND CASTLE WAS ONE OF THOSE EXCELLENT MUSICIANS HERE AND THERE TO BEFOUND IN OUR PROVINCES WORTHY TO COMPARE WITH MANY A NOTEDKAPELLMEISTER IN A COUNTRY WHICH OFFERS MORE PLENTIFUL CONDITIONS OFMUSICAL CELEBRITY
 ROSAMOND WITH THE EXECUTANTS INSTINCT HAD SEIZEDHIS MANNER OF PLAYING AND GAVE FORTH HIS LARGE RENDERING OF NOBLEMUSIC WITH THE PRECISION OF AN ECHO
 IT WAS ALMOST STARTLING HEARD FORTHE FIRST TIME
 A HIDDEN SOUL SEEMED TO BE FLOWING FORTH FROMROSAMONDS FINGERS AND SO INDEED IT WAS SINCE SOULS LIVE ON INPERPETUAL ECHOES AND TO ALL FINE EXPRESSION THERE GOES SOMEWHERE ANORIGINATING ACTIVITY IF IT BE ONLY THAT OF AN INTERPRETER
 LYDGATE WASTAKEN POSSESSION OF AND BEGAN TO BELIEVE IN HER AS SOMETHINGEXCEPTIONAL
 AFTER ALL HE THOUGHT ONE NEED NOT BE SURPRISED TO FINDTHE RARE CONJUNCTIONS OF NATURE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES APPARENTLYUNFAVORABLE COME WHERE THEY MAY THEY ALWAYS DEPEND ON CONDITIONS THATARE NOT OBVIOUS
 HE SAT LOOKING AT HER AND DID NOT RISE TO PAY HER ANYCOMPLIMENTS LEAVING THAT TO OTHERS NOW THAT HIS ADMIRATION WASDEEPENED
HER SINGING WAS LESS REMARKABLE BUT ALSO WELL TRAINED AND SWEET TOHEAR AS A CHIME PERFECTLY IN TUNE
 IT IS TRUE SHE SANG MEET ME BYMOONLIGHT AND IVE BEEN ROAMING FOR MORTALS MUST SHARE THEFASHIONS OF THEIR TIME AND NONE BUT THE ANCIENTS CAN BE ALWAYSCLASSICAL
 BUT ROSAMOND COULD ALSO SING BLACKEYED SUSAN WITH EFFECTOR HAYDNS CANZONETS OR VOI CHE SAPETE OR BATTI BATTISHE ONLYWANTED TO KNOW WHAT HER AUDIENCE LIKED
HER FATHER LOOKED ROUND AT THE COMPANY DELIGHTING IN THEIR ADMIRATION
HER MOTHER SAT LIKE A NIOBE BEFORE HER TROUBLES WITH HER YOUNGESTLITTLE GIRL ON HER LAP SOFTLY BEATING THE CHILDS HAND UP AND DOWN INTIME TO THE MUSIC
 AND FRED NOTWITHSTANDING HIS GENERAL SCEPTICISMABOUT ROSY LISTENED TO HER MUSIC WITH PERFECT ALLEGIANCE WISHING HECOULD DO THE SAME THING ON HIS FLUTE
 IT WAS THE PLEASANTEST FAMILYPARTY THAT LYDGATE HAD SEEN SINCE HE CAME TO MIDDLEMARCH
 THE VINCYSHAD THE READINESS TO ENJOY THE REJECTION OF ALL ANXIETY AND THEBELIEF IN LIFE AS A MERRY LOT WHICH MADE A HOUSE EXCEPTIONAL IN MOSTCOUNTY TOWNS AT THAT TIME WHEN EVANGELICALISM HAD CAST A CERTAINSUSPICION AS OF PLAGUEINFECTION OVER THE FEW AMUSEMENTS WHICH SURVIVEDIN THE PROVINCES
 AT THE VINCYS THERE WAS ALWAYS WHIST AND THECARDTABLES STOOD READY NOW MAKING SOME OF THE COMPANY SECRETLYIMPATIENT OF THE MUSIC
 BEFORE IT CEASED MR
 FAREBROTHER CAME INAHANDSOME BROADCHESTED BUT OTHERWISE SMALL MAN ABOUT FORTY WHOSEBLACK WAS VERY THREADBARE THE BRILLIANCY WAS ALL IN HIS QUICK GRAYEYES
 HE CAME LIKE A PLEASANT CHANGE IN THE LIGHT ARRESTING LITTLELOUISA WITH FATHERLY NONSENSE AS SHE WAS BEING LED OUT OF THE ROOM BYMISS MORGAN GREETING EVERYBODY WITH SOME SPECIAL WORD AND SEEMING TOCONDENSE MORE TALK INTO TEN MINUTES THAN HAD BEEN HELD ALL THROUGH THEEVENING
 HE CLAIMED FROM LYDGATE THE FULFILMENT OF A PROMISE TO COMEAND SEE HIM
 I CANT LET YOU OFF YOU KNOW BECAUSE I HAVE SOMEBEETLES TO SHOW YOU
 WE COLLECTORS FEEL AN INTEREST IN EVERY NEW MANTILL HE HAS SEEN ALL WE HAVE TO SHOW HIM
BUT SOON HE SWERVED TO THE WHISTTABLE RUBBING HIS HANDS AND SAYINGCOME NOW LET US BE SERIOUS
 MR
 LYDGATE
 NOT PLAY
 AH
 YOU ARE TOOYOUNG AND LIGHT FOR THIS KIND OF THING
LYDGATE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT THE CLERGYMAN WHOSE ABILITIES WERE SOPAINFUL TO MR
 BULSTRODE APPEARED TO HAVE FOUND AN AGREEABLE RESORT INTHIS CERTAINLY NOT ERUDITE HOUSEHOLD
 HE COULD HALF UNDERSTAND IT THEGOODHUMOR THE GOOD LOOKS OF ELDER AND YOUNGER AND THE PROVISION FORPASSING THE TIME WITHOUT ANY LABOR OF INTELLIGENCE MIGHT MAKE THEHOUSE BEGUILING TO PEOPLE WHO HAD NO PARTICULAR USE FOR THEIR ODDHOURS
EVERYTHING LOOKED BLOOMING AND JOYOUS EXCEPT MISS MORGAN WHO WASBROWN DULL AND RESIGNED AND ALTOGETHER AS MRS
 VINCY OFTEN SAIDJUST THE SORT OF PERSON FOR A GOVERNESS
 LYDGATE DID NOT MEAN TO PAYMANY SUCH VISITS HIMSELF
 THEY WERE A WRETCHED WASTE OF THE EVENINGSAND NOW WHEN HE HAD TALKED A LITTLE MORE TO ROSAMOND HE MEANT TOEXCUSE HIMSELF AND GO
YOU WILL NOT LIKE US AT MIDDLEMARCH I FEEL SURE SHE SAID WHEN THEWHISTPLAYERS WERE SETTLED
 WE ARE VERY STUPID AND YOU HAVE BEEN USEDTO SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
I SUPPOSE ALL COUNTRY TOWNS ARE PRETTY MUCH ALIKE SAID LYDGATE
 BUTI HAVE NOTICED THAT ONE ALWAYS BELIEVES ONES OWN TOWN TO BE MORESTUPID THAN ANY OTHER
 I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO TAKE MIDDLEMARCH AS ITCOMES AND SHALL BE MUCH OBLIGED IF THE TOWN WILL TAKE ME IN THE SAMEWAY
 I HAVE CERTAINLY FOUND SOME CHARMS IN IT WHICH ARE MUCH GREATERTHAN I HAD EXPECTED
YOU MEAN THE RIDES TOWARDS TIPTON AND LOWICK EVERY ONE IS PLEASEDWITH THOSE SAID ROSAMOND WITH SIMPLICITY
NO I MEAN SOMETHING MUCH NEARER TO ME
ROSAMOND ROSE AND REACHED HER NETTING AND THEN SAID DO YOU CAREABOUT DANCING AT ALL
 I AM NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER CLEVER MEN EVERDANCE
I WOULD DANCE WITH YOU IF YOU WOULD ALLOW ME
OH
 SAID ROSAMOND WITH A SLIGHT DEPRECATORY LAUGH
 I WAS ONLY GOINGTO SAY THAT WE SOMETIMES HAVE DANCING AND I WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER YOUWOULD FEEL INSULTED IF YOU WERE ASKED TO COME
NOT ON THE CONDITION I MENTIONED
AFTER THIS CHAT LYDGATE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS GOING BUT ON MOVINGTOWARDS THE WHISTTABLES HE GOT INTERESTED IN WATCHING MR
FAREBROTHERS PLAY WHICH WAS MASTERLY AND ALSO HIS FACE WHICH WAS ASTRIKING MIXTURE OF THE SHREWD AND THE MILD
 AT TEN OCLOCK SUPPER WASBROUGHT IN SUCH WERE THE CUSTOMS OF MIDDLEMARCH AND THERE WASPUNCHDRINKING BUT MR
 FAREBROTHER HAD ONLY A GLASS OF WATER
 HE WASWINNING BUT THERE SEEMED TO BE NO REASON WHY THE RENEWAL OF RUBBERSSHOULD END AND LYDGATE AT LAST TOOK HIS LEAVE
BUT AS IT WAS NOT ELEVEN OCLOCK HE CHOSE TO WALK IN THE BRISK AIRTOWARDS THE TOWER OF ST
 BOTOLPHS MR
 FAREBROTHERS CHURCH WHICHSTOOD OUT DARK SQUARE AND MASSIVE AGAINST THE STARLIGHT
 IT WAS THEOLDEST CHURCH IN MIDDLEMARCH THE LIVING HOWEVER WAS BUT A VICARAGEWORTH BARELY FOUR HUNDRED AYEAR
 LYDGATE HAD HEARD THAT AND HEWONDERED NOW WHETHER MR
 FAREBROTHER CARED ABOUT THE MONEY HE WON ATCARDS THINKING HE SEEMS A VERY PLEASANT FELLOW BUT BULSTRODE MAYHAVE HIS GOOD REASONS
 MANY THINGS WOULD BE EASIER TO LYDGATE IF ITSHOULD TURN OUT THAT MR
 BULSTRODE WAS GENERALLY JUSTIFIABLE
 WHAT ISHIS RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE TO ME IF HE CARRIES SOME GOOD NOTIONS ALONGWITH IT
 ONE MUST USE SUCH BRAINS AS ARE TO BE FOUND
THESE WERE ACTUALLY LYDGATES FIRST MEDITATIONS AS HE WALKED AWAY FROMMR
 VINCYS AND ON THIS GROUND I FEAR THAT MANY LADIES WILL CONSIDERHIM HARDLY WORTHY OF THEIR ATTENTION
 HE THOUGHT OF ROSAMOND AND HERMUSIC ONLY IN THE SECOND PLACE AND THOUGH WHEN HER TURN CAME HEDWELT ON THE IMAGE OF HER FOR THE REST OF HIS WALK HE FELT NOAGITATION AND HAD NO SENSE THAT ANY NEW CURRENT HAD SET INTO HIS LIFE
HE COULD NOT MARRY YET HE WISHED NOT TO MARRY FOR SEVERAL YEARS ANDTHEREFORE HE WAS NOT READY TO ENTERTAIN THE NOTION OF BEING IN LOVEWITH A GIRL WHOM HE HAPPENED TO ADMIRE
 HE DID ADMIRE ROSAMONDEXCEEDINGLY BUT THAT MADNESS WHICH HAD ONCE BESET HIM ABOUT LAURE WASNOT HE THOUGHT LIKELY TO RECUR IN RELATION TO ANY OTHER WOMAN
CERTAINLY IF FALLING IN LOVE HAD BEEN AT ALL IN QUESTION IT WOULDHAVE BEEN QUITE SAFE WITH A CREATURE LIKE THIS MISS VINCY WHO HAD JUSTTHE KIND OF INTELLIGENCE ONE WOULD DESIRE IN A WOMANPOLISHED REFINEDDOCILE LENDING ITSELF TO FINISH IN ALL THE DELICACIES OF LIFE ANDENSHRINED IN A BODY WHICH EXPRESSED THIS WITH A FORCE OF DEMONSTRATIONTHAT EXCLUDED THE NEED FOR OTHER EVIDENCE
 LYDGATE FELT SURE THAT IFEVER HE MARRIED HIS WIFE WOULD HAVE THAT FEMININE RADIANCE THATDISTINCTIVE WOMANHOOD WHICH MUST BE CLASSED WITH FLOWERS AND MUSICTHAT SORT OF BEAUTY WHICH BY ITS VERY NATURE WAS VIRTUOUS BEINGMOULDED ONLY FOR PURE AND DELICATE JOYS
BUT SINCE HE DID NOT MEAN TO MARRY FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARSHIS MOREPRESSING BUSINESS WAS TO LOOK INTO LOUIS NEW BOOK ON FEVER WHICH HEWAS SPECIALLY INTERESTED IN BECAUSE HE HAD KNOWN LOUIS IN PARIS ANDHAD FOLLOWED MANY ANATOMICAL DEMONSTRATIONS IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THESPECIFIC DIFFERENCES OF TYPHUS AND TYPHOID
 HE WENT HOME AND READ FARINTO THE SMALLEST HOUR BRINGING A MUCH MORE TESTING VISION OF DETAILSAND RELATIONS INTO THIS PATHOLOGICAL STUDY THAN HE HAD EVER THOUGHT ITNECESSARY TO APPLY TO THE COMPLEXITIES OF LOVE AND MARRIAGE THESEBEING SUBJECTS ON WHICH HE FELT HIMSELF AMPLY INFORMED BY LITERATUREAND THAT TRADITIONAL WISDOM WHICH IS HANDED DOWN IN THE GENIALCONVERSATION OF MEN
 WHEREAS FEVER HAD OBSCURE CONDITIONS AND GAVE HIMTHAT DELIGHTFUL LABOR OF THE IMAGINATION WHICH IS NOT MEREARBITRARINESS BUT THE EXERCISE OF DISCIPLINED POWERCOMBINING ANDCONSTRUCTING WITH THE CLEAREST EYE FOR PROBABILITIES AND THE FULLESTOBEDIENCE TO KNOWLEDGE AND THEN IN YET MORE ENERGETIC ALLIANCE WITHIMPARTIAL NATURE STANDING ALOOF TO INVENT TESTS BY WHICH TO TRY ITSOWN WORK
MANY MEN HAVE BEEN PRAISED AS VIVIDLY IMAGINATIVE ON THE STRENGTH OFTHEIR PROFUSENESS IN INDIFFERENT DRAWING OR CHEAP NARRATIONREPORTS OFVERY POOR TALK GOING ON IN DISTANT ORBS OR PORTRAITS OF LUCIFER COMINGDOWN ON HIS BAD ERRANDS AS A LARGE UGLY MAN WITH BATS WINGS AND SPURTSOF PHOSPHORESCENCE OR EXAGGERATIONS OF WANTONNESS THAT SEEM TO REFLECTLIFE IN A DISEASED DREAM
 BUT THESE KINDS OF INSPIRATION LYDGATEREGARDED AS RATHER VULGAR AND VINOUS COMPARED WITH THE IMAGINATION THATREVEALS SUBTLE ACTIONS INACCESSIBLE BY ANY SORT OF LENS BUT TRACKED INTHAT OUTER DARKNESS THROUGH LONG PATHWAYS OF NECESSARY SEQUENCE BY THEINWARD LIGHT WHICH IS THE LAST REFINEMENT OF ENERGY CAPABLE OF BATHINGEVEN THE ETHEREAL ATOMS IN ITS IDEALLY ILLUMINATED SPACE
 HE FOR HISPART HAD TOSSED AWAY ALL CHEAP INVENTIONS WHERE IGNORANCE FINDS ITSELFABLE AND AT EASE HE WAS ENAMOURED OF THAT ARDUOUS INVENTION WHICH ISTHE VERY EYE OF RESEARCH PROVISIONALLY FRAMING ITS OBJECT ANDCORRECTING IT TO MORE AND MORE EXACTNESS OF RELATION HE WANTED TOPIERCE THE OBSCURITY OF THOSE MINUTE PROCESSES WHICH PREPARE HUMANMISERY AND JOY THOSE INVISIBLE THOROUGHFARES WHICH ARE THE FIRSTLURKINGPLACES OF ANGUISH MANIA AND CRIME THAT DELICATE POISE ANDTRANSITION WHICH DETERMINE THE GROWTH OF HAPPY OR UNHAPPYCONSCIOUSNESS
AS HE THREW DOWN HIS BOOK STRETCHED HIS LEGS TOWARDS THE EMBERS IN THEGRATE AND CLASPED HIS HANDS AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD IN THAT AGREEABLEAFTERGLOW OF EXCITEMENT WHEN THOUGHT LAPSES FROM EXAMINATION OF ASPECIFIC OBJECT INTO A SUFFUSIVE SENSE OF ITS CONNECTIONS WITH ALL THEREST OF OUR EXISTENCESEEMS AS IT WERE TO THROW ITSELF ON ITS BACKAFTER VIGOROUS SWIMMING AND FLOAT WITH THE REPOSE OF UNEXHAUSTEDSTRENGTHLYDGATE FELT A TRIUMPHANT DELIGHT IN HIS STUDIES ANDSOMETHING LIKE PITY FOR THOSE LESS LUCKY MEN WHO WERE NOT OF HISPROFESSION
IF I HAD NOT TAKEN THAT TURN WHEN I WAS A LAD HE THOUGHT I MIGHTHAVE GOT INTO SOME STUPID DRAUGHTHORSE WORK OR OTHER AND LIVED ALWAYSIN BLINKERS
 I SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN HAPPY IN ANY PROFESSION THAT DIDNOT CALL FORTH THE HIGHEST INTELLECTUAL STRAIN AND YET KEEP ME IN GOODWARM CONTACT WITH MY NEIGHBORS
 THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THE MEDICALPROFESSION FOR THAT ONE CAN HAVE THE EXCLUSIVE SCIENTIFIC LIFE THATTOUCHES THE DISTANCE AND BEFRIEND THE OLD FOGIES IN THE PARISH TOO
 ITIS RATHER HARDER FOR A CLERGYMAN FAREBROTHER SEEMS TO BE AN ANOMALY
THIS LAST THOUGHT BROUGHT BACK THE VINCYS AND ALL THE PICTURES OF THEEVENING
 THEY FLOATED IN HIS MIND AGREEABLY ENOUGH AND AS HE TOOK UPHIS BEDCANDLE HIS LIPS WERE CURLED WITH THAT INCIPIENT SMILE WHICH ISAPT TO ACCOMPANY AGREEABLE RECOLLECTIONS
 HE WAS AN ARDENT FELLOW BUTAT PRESENT HIS ARDOR WAS ABSORBED IN LOVE OF HIS WORK AND IN THEAMBITION OF MAKING HIS LIFE RECOGNIZED AS A FACTOR IN THE BETTER LIFEOF MANKINDLIKE OTHER HEROES OF SCIENCE WHO HAD NOTHING BUT AN OBSCURECOUNTRY PRACTICE TO BEGIN WITH
POOR LYDGATE
 OR SHALL I SAY POOR ROSAMOND
 EACH LIVED IN A WORLD OFWHICH THE OTHER KNEW NOTHING
 IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO LYDGATE THAT HEHAD BEEN A SUBJECT OF EAGER MEDITATION TO ROSAMOND WHO HAD NEITHER ANYREASON FOR THROWING HER MARRIAGE INTO DISTANT PERSPECTIVE NOR ANYPATHOLOGICAL STUDIES TO DIVERT HER MIND FROM THAT RUMINATING HABITTHAT INWARD REPETITION OF LOOKS WORDS AND PHRASES WHICH MAKES ALARGE PART IN THE LIVES OF MOST GIRLS
 HE HAD NOT MEANT TO LOOK AT HEROR SPEAK TO HER WITH MORE THAN THE INEVITABLE AMOUNT OF ADMIRATION ANDCOMPLIMENT WHICH A MAN MUST GIVE TO A BEAUTIFUL GIRL INDEED IT SEEMEDTO HIM THAT HIS ENJOYMENT OF HER MUSIC HAD REMAINED ALMOST SILENT FORHE FEARED FALLING INTO THE RUDENESS OF TELLING HER HIS GREAT SURPRISEAT HER POSSESSION OF SUCH ACCOMPLISHMENT
 BUT ROSAMOND HAD REGISTEREDEVERY LOOK AND WORD AND ESTIMATED THEM AS THE OPENING INCIDENTS OF APRECONCEIVED ROMANCEINCIDENTS WHICH GATHER VALUE FROM THE FORESEENDEVELOPMENT AND CLIMAX
 IN ROSAMONDS ROMANCE IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TOIMAGINE MUCH ABOUT THE INWARD LIFE OF THE HERO OR OF HIS SERIOUSBUSINESS IN THE WORLD OF COURSE HE HAD A PROFESSION AND WAS CLEVERAS WELL AS SUFFICIENTLY HANDSOME BUT THE PIQUANT FACT ABOUT LYDGATEWAS HIS GOOD BIRTH WHICH DISTINGUISHED HIM FROM ALL MIDDLEMARCHADMIRERS AND PRESENTED MARRIAGE AS A PROSPECT OF RISING IN RANK ANDGETTING A LITTLE NEARER TO THAT CELESTIAL CONDITION ON EARTH IN WHICHSHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH VULGAR PEOPLE AND PERHAPS AT LASTASSOCIATE WITH RELATIVES QUITE EQUAL TO THE COUNTY PEOPLE WHO LOOKEDDOWN ON THE MIDDLEMARCHERS
 IT WAS PART OF ROSAMONDS CLEVERNESS TODISCERN VERY SUBTLY THE FAINTEST AROMA OF RANK AND ONCE WHEN SHE HADSEEN THE MISS BROOKES ACCOMPANYING THEIR UNCLE AT THE COUNTY ASSIZESAND SEATED AMONG THE ARISTOCRACY SHE HAD ENVIED THEM NOTWITHSTANDINGTHEIR PLAIN DRESS
IF YOU THINK IT INCREDIBLE THAT TO IMAGINE LYDGATE AS A MAN OF FAMILYCOULD CAUSE THRILLS OF SATISFACTION WHICH HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THESENSE THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM I WILL ASK YOU TO USE YOUR POWEROF COMPARISON A LITTLE MORE EFFECTIVELY AND CONSIDER WHETHER RED CLOTHAND EPAULETS HAVE NEVER HAD AN INFLUENCE OF THAT SORT
 OUR PASSIONS DONOT LIVE APART IN LOCKED CHAMBERS BUT DRESSED IN THEIR SMALL WARDROBEOF NOTIONS BRING THEIR PROVISIONS TO A COMMON TABLE AND MESS TOGETHERFEEDING OUT OF THE COMMON STORE ACCORDING TO THEIR APPETITE
ROSAMOND IN FACT WAS ENTIRELY OCCUPIED NOT EXACTLY WITH TERTIUSLYDGATE AS HE WAS IN HIMSELF BUT WITH HIS RELATION TO HER AND IT WASEXCUSABLE IN A GIRL WHO WAS ACCUSTOMED TO HEAR THAT ALL YOUNG MENMIGHT COULD WOULD BE OR ACTUALLY WERE IN LOVE WITH HER TO BELIEVEAT ONCE THAT LYDGATE COULD BE NO EXCEPTION
 HIS LOOKS AND WORDS MEANTMORE TO HER THAN OTHER MENS BECAUSE SHE CARED MORE FOR THEM SHETHOUGHT OF THEM DILIGENTLY AND DILIGENTLY ATTENDED TO THAT PERFECTIONOF APPEARANCE BEHAVIOR SENTIMENTS AND ALL OTHER ELEGANCIES WHICHWOULD FIND IN LYDGATE A MORE ADEQUATE ADMIRER THAN SHE HAD YET BEENCONSCIOUS OF
FOR ROSAMOND THOUGH SHE WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING THAT WAS DISAGREEABLETO HER WAS INDUSTRIOUS AND NOW MORE THAN EVER SHE WAS ACTIVE INSKETCHING HER LANDSCAPES AND MARKETCARTS AND PORTRAITS OF FRIENDS INPRACTISING HER MUSIC AND IN BEING FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT HER OWNSTANDARD OF A PERFECT LADY HAVING ALWAYS AN AUDIENCE IN HER OWNCONSCIOUSNESS WITH SOMETIMES THE NOT UNWELCOME ADDITION OF A MOREVARIABLE EXTERNAL AUDIENCE IN THE NUMEROUS VISITORS OF THE HOUSE
 SHEFOUND TIME ALSO TO READ THE BEST NOVELS AND EVEN THE SECOND BEST ANDSHE KNEW MUCH POETRY BY HEART
 HER FAVORITE POEM WAS LALLA ROOKH
THE BEST GIRL IN THE WORLD
 HE WILL BE A HAPPY FELLOW WHO GETS HER
WAS THE SENTIMENT OF THE ELDERLY GENTLEMEN WHO VISITED THE VINCYS ANDTHE REJECTED YOUNG MEN THOUGHT OF TRYING AGAIN AS IS THE FASHION INCOUNTRY TOWNS WHERE THE HORIZON IS NOT THICK WITH COMING RIVALS
 BUTMRS
 PLYMDALE THOUGHT THAT ROSAMOND HAD BEEN EDUCATED TO A RIDICULOUSPITCH FOR WHAT WAS THE USE OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHICH WOULD BE ALL LAIDASIDE AS SOON AS SHE WAS MARRIED
 WHILE HER AUNT BULSTRODE WHO HAD ASISTERLY FAITHFULNESS TOWARDS HER BROTHERS FAMILY HAD TWO SINCEREWISHES FOR ROSAMONDTHAT SHE MIGHT SHOW A MORE SERIOUS TURN OF MINDAND THAT SHE MIGHT MEET WITH A HUSBAND WHOSE WEALTH CORRESPONDED TO HERHABITS
CHAPTER XVII
THE CLERKLY PERSON SMILED AND SAIDPROMISE WAS A PRETTY MAIDBUT BEING POOR SHE DIED UNWED
THE REV
 CAMDEN FAREBROTHER WHOM LYDGATE WENT TO SEE THE NEXT EVENINGLIVED IN AN OLD PARSONAGE BUILT OF STONE VENERABLE ENOUGH TO MATCHTHE CHURCH WHICH IT LOOKED OUT UPON
 ALL THE FURNITURE TOO IN THE HOUSEWAS OLD BUT WITH ANOTHER GRADE OF AGETHAT OF MR
 FAREBROTHERS FATHERAND GRANDFATHER
 THERE WERE PAINTED WHITE CHAIRS WITH GILDING ANDWREATHS ON THEM AND SOME LINGERING RED SILK DAMASK WITH SLITS IN IT
THERE WERE ENGRAVED PORTRAITS OF LORD CHANCELLORS AND OTHER CELEBRATEDLAWYERS OF THE LAST CENTURY AND THERE WERE OLD PIERGLASSES TO REFLECTTHEM AS WELL AS THE LITTLE SATINWOOD TABLES AND THE SOFAS RESEMBLINGA PROLONGATION OF UNEASY CHAIRS ALL STANDING IN RELIEF AGAINST THEDARK WAINSCOT
 THIS WAS THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE DRAWINGROOM INTO WHICHLYDGATE WAS SHOWN AND THERE WERE THREE LADIES TO RECEIVE HIM WHO WEREALSO OLDFASHIONED AND OF A FADED BUT GENUINE RESPECTABILITY MRS
FAREBROTHER THE VICARS WHITEHAIRED MOTHER BEFRILLED AND KERCHIEFEDWITH DAINTY CLEANLINESS UPRIGHT QUICKEYED AND STILL UNDER SEVENTYMISS NOBLE HER SISTER A TINY OLD LADY OF MEEKER ASPECT WITH FRILLSAND KERCHIEF DECIDEDLY MORE WORN AND MENDED AND MISS WINIFREDFAREBROTHER THE VICARS ELDER SISTER WELLLOOKING LIKE HIMSELF BUTNIPPED AND SUBDUED AS SINGLE WOMEN ARE APT TO BE WHO SPEND THEIR LIVESIN UNINTERRUPTED SUBJECTION TO THEIR ELDERS
 LYDGATE HAD NOT EXPECTEDTO SEE SO QUAINT A GROUP KNOWING SIMPLY THAT MR
 FAREBROTHER WAS ABACHELOR HE HAD THOUGHT OF BEING USHERED INTO A SNUGGERY WHERE THECHIEF FURNITURE WOULD PROBABLY BE BOOKS AND COLLECTIONS OF NATURALOBJECTS
 THE VICAR HIMSELF SEEMED TO WEAR RATHER A CHANGED ASPECT ASMOST MEN DO WHEN ACQUAINTANCES MADE ELSEWHERE SEE THEM FOR THE FIRSTTIME IN THEIR OWN HOMES SOME INDEED SHOWING LIKE AN ACTOR OF GENIALPARTS DISADVANTAGEOUSLY CAST FOR THE CURMUDGEON IN A NEW PIECE
 THISWAS NOT THE CASE WITH MR
 FAREBROTHER HE SEEMED A TRIFLE MILDER ANDMORE SILENT THE CHIEF TALKER BEING HIS MOTHER WHILE HE ONLY PUT IN AGOODHUMORED MODERATING REMARK HERE AND THERE
 THE OLD LADY WASEVIDENTLY ACCUSTOMED TO TELL HER COMPANY WHAT THEY OUGHT TO THINK ANDTO REGARD NO SUBJECT AS QUITE SAFE WITHOUT HER STEERING
 SHE WASAFFORDED LEISURE FOR THIS FUNCTION BY HAVING ALL HER LITTLE WANTSATTENDED TO BY MISS WINIFRED
 MEANWHILE TINY MISS NOBLE CARRIED ON HERARM A SMALL BASKET INTO WHICH SHE DIVERTED A BIT OF SUGAR WHICH SHEHAD FIRST DROPPED IN HER SAUCER AS IF BY MISTAKE LOOKING ROUNDFURTIVELY AFTERWARDS AND REVERTING TO HER TEACUP WITH A SMALL INNOCENTNOISE AS OF A TINY TIMID QUADRUPED
 PRAY THINK NO ILL OF MISS NOBLE
THAT BASKET HELD SMALL SAVINGS FROM HER MORE PORTABLE FOOD DESTINEDFOR THE CHILDREN OF HER POOR FRIENDS AMONG WHOM SHE TROTTED ON FINEMORNINGS FOSTERING AND PETTING ALL NEEDY CREATURES BEING SOSPONTANEOUS A DELIGHT TO HER THAT SHE REGARDED IT MUCH AS IF IT HADBEEN A PLEASANT VICE THAT SHE WAS ADDICTED TO
 PERHAPS SHE WASCONSCIOUS OF BEING TEMPTED TO STEAL FROM THOSE WHO HAD MUCH THAT SHEMIGHT GIVE TO THOSE WHO HAD NOTHING AND CARRIED IN HER CONSCIENCE THEGUILT OF THAT REPRESSED DESIRE
 ONE MUST BE POOR TO KNOW THE LUXURY OFGIVING
MRS
 FAREBROTHER WELCOMED THE GUEST WITH A LIVELY FORMALITY ANDPRECISION
 SHE PRESENTLY INFORMED HIM THAT THEY WERE NOT OFTEN IN WANTOF MEDICAL AID IN THAT HOUSE
 SHE HAD BROUGHT UP HER CHILDREN TO WEARFLANNEL AND NOT TO OVEREAT THEMSELVES WHICH LAST HABIT SHE CONSIDEREDTHE CHIEF REASON WHY PEOPLE NEEDED DOCTORS
 LYDGATE PLEADED FOR THOSEWHOSE FATHERS AND MOTHERS HAD OVEREATEN THEMSELVES BUT MRS
FAREBROTHER HELD THAT VIEW OF THINGS DANGEROUS NATURE WAS MORE JUSTTHAN THAT IT WOULD BE EASY FOR ANY FELON TO SAY THAT HIS ANCESTORSOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN HANGED INSTEAD OF HIM
 IF THOSE WHO HAD BAD FATHERSAND MOTHERS WERE BAD THEMSELVES THEY WERE HANGED FOR THAT
 THERE WASNO NEED TO GO BACK ON WHAT YOU COULDNT SEE
MY MOTHER IS LIKE OLD GEORGE THE THIRD SAID THE VICAR SHE OBJECTSTO METAPHYSICS
I OBJECT TO WHAT IS WRONG CAMDEN
 I SAY KEEP HOLD OF A FEW PLAINTRUTHS AND MAKE EVERYTHING SQUARE WITH THEM
 WHEN I WAS YOUNG MR
LYDGATE THERE NEVER WAS ANY QUESTION ABOUT RIGHT AND WRONG
 WE KNEWOUR CATECHISM AND THAT WAS ENOUGH WE LEARNED OUR CREED AND OUR DUTY
EVERY RESPECTABLE CHURCH PERSON HAD THE SAME OPINIONS
 BUT NOW IF YOUSPEAK OUT OF THE PRAYERBOOK ITSELF YOU ARE LIABLE TO BECONTRADICTED
THAT MAKES RATHER A PLEASANT TIME OF IT FOR THOSE WHO LIKE TO MAINTAINTHEIR OWN POINT SAID LYDGATE
BUT MY MOTHER ALWAYS GIVES WAY SAID THE VICAR SLYLY
NO NO CAMDEN YOU MUST NOT LEAD MR
 LYDGATE INTO A MISTAKE ABOUTME
 I SHALL NEVER SHOW THAT DISRESPECT TO MY PARENTS TO GIVE UP WHATTHEY TAUGHT ME
 ANY ONE MAY SEE WHAT COMES OF TURNING
 IF YOU CHANGEONCE WHY NOT TWENTY TIMES
A MAN MIGHT SEE GOOD ARGUMENTS FOR CHANGING ONCE AND NOT SEE THEM FORCHANGING AGAIN SAID LYDGATE AMUSED WITH THE DECISIVE OLD LADY
EXCUSE ME THERE
 IF YOU GO UPON ARGUMENTS THEY ARE NEVER WANTINGWHEN A MAN HAS NO CONSTANCY OF MIND
 MY FATHER NEVER CHANGED AND HEPREACHED PLAIN MORAL SERMONS WITHOUT ARGUMENTS AND WAS A GOOD MANFEWBETTER
 WHEN YOU GET ME A GOOD MAN MADE OUT OF ARGUMENTS I WILL GETYOU A GOOD DINNER WITH READING YOU THE COOKERYBOOK
 THATS MY OPINIONAND I THINK ANYBODYS STOMACH WILL BEAR ME OUT
ABOUT THE DINNER CERTAINLY MOTHER SAID MR
 FAREBROTHER
IT IS THE SAME THING THE DINNER OR THE MAN
 I AM NEARLY SEVENTY MR
LYDGATE AND I GO UPON EXPERIENCE
 I AM NOT LIKELY TO FOLLOW NEWLIGHTS THOUGH THERE ARE PLENTY OF THEM HERE AS ELSEWHERE
 I SAY THEYCAME IN WITH THE MIXED STUFFS THAT WILL NEITHER WASH NOR WEAR
 IT WASNOT SO IN MY YOUTH A CHURCHMAN WAS A CHURCHMAN AND A CLERGYMAN YOUMIGHT BE PRETTY SURE WAS A GENTLEMAN IF NOTHING ELSE
 BUT NOW HE MAYBE NO BETTER THAN A DISSENTER AND WANT TO PUSH ASIDE MY SON ONPRETENCE OF DOCTRINE
 BUT WHOEVER MAY WISH TO PUSH HIM ASIDE I AMPROUD TO SAY MR
 LYDGATE THAT HE WILL COMPARE WITH ANY PREACHER INTHIS KINGDOM NOT TO SPEAK OF THIS TOWN WHICH IS BUT A LOW STANDARD TOGO BY AT LEAST TO MY THINKING FOR I WAS BORN AND BRED AT EXETER
A MOTHER IS NEVER PARTIAL SAID MR
 FAREBROTHER SMILING
 WHAT DOYOU THINK TYKES MOTHER SAYS ABOUT HIM
AH POOR CREATURE
 WHAT INDEED
 SAID MRS
 FAREBROTHER HER SHARPNESSBLUNTED FOR THE MOMENT BY HER CONFIDENCE IN MATERNAL JUDGMENTS
 SHESAYS THE TRUTH TO HERSELF DEPEND UPON IT
AND WHAT IS THE TRUTH
 SAID LYDGATE
 I AM CURIOUS TO KNOW
OH NOTHING BAD AT ALL SAID MR
 FAREBROTHER
 HE IS A ZEALOUSFELLOW NOT VERY LEARNED AND NOT VERY WISE I THINKBECAUSE I DONTAGREE WITH HIM
WHY CAMDEN
 SAID MISS WINIFRED GRIFFIN AND HIS WIFE TOLD ME ONLYTODAY THAT MR
 TYKE SAID THEY SHOULD HAVE NO MORE COALS IF THEY CAMETO HEAR YOU PREACH
MRS
 FAREBROTHER LAID DOWN HER KNITTING WHICH SHE HAD RESUMED AFTERHER SMALL ALLOWANCE OF TEA AND TOAST AND LOOKED AT HER SON AS IF TOSAY YOU HEAR THAT
 MISS NOBLE SAID OH POOR THINGS
 POOR THINGS
 INREFERENCE PROBABLY TO THE DOUBLE LOSS OF PREACHING AND COAL
 BUT THEVICAR ANSWERED QUIETLYTHAT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MY PARISHIONERS
 AND I DONT THINK MYSERMONS ARE WORTH A LOAD OF COALS TO THEM
MR
 LYDGATE SAID MRS
 FAREBROTHER WHO COULD NOT LET THIS PASS YOUDONT KNOW MY SON HE ALWAYS UNDERVALUES HIMSELF
 I TELL HIM HE ISUNDERVALUING THE GOD WHO MADE HIM AND MADE HIM A MOST EXCELLENTPREACHER
THAT MUST BE A HINT FOR ME TO TAKE MR
 LYDGATE AWAY TO MY STUDYMOTHER SAID THE VICAR LAUGHING
 I PROMISED TO SHOW YOU MYCOLLECTION HE ADDED TURNING TO LYDGATE SHALL WE GO
ALL THREE LADIES REMONSTRATED
 MR
 LYDGATE OUGHT NOT TO BE HURRIED AWAYWITHOUT BEING ALLOWED TO ACCEPT ANOTHER CUP OF TEA MISS WINIFRED HADABUNDANCE OF GOOD TEA IN THE POT
 WHY WAS CAMDEN IN SUCH HASTE TO TAKEA VISITOR TO HIS DEN
 THERE WAS NOTHING BUT PICKLED VERMIN AND DRAWERSFULL OF BLUEBOTTLES AND MOTHS WITH NO CARPET ON THE FLOOR
 MR
LYDGATE MUST EXCUSE IT
 A GAME AT CRIBBAGE WOULD BE FAR BETTER
 INSHORT IT WAS PLAIN THAT A VICAR MIGHT BE ADORED BY HIS WOMANKIND ASTHE KING OF MEN AND PREACHERS AND YET BE HELD BY THEM TO STAND IN MUCHNEED OF THEIR DIRECTION
 LYDGATE WITH THE USUAL SHALLOWNESS OF A YOUNGBACHELOR WONDERED THAT MR
 FAREBROTHER HAD NOT TAUGHT THEM BETTER
MY MOTHER IS NOT USED TO MY HAVING VISITORS WHO CAN TAKE ANY INTERESTIN MY HOBBIES SAID THE VICAR AS HE OPENED THE DOOR OF HIS STUDYWHICH WAS INDEED AS BARE OF LUXURIES FOR THE BODY AS THE LADIES HADIMPLIED UNLESS A SHORT PORCELAIN PIPE AND A TOBACCOBOX WERE TO BEEXCEPTED
MEN OF YOUR PROFESSION DONT GENERALLY SMOKE HE SAID
 LYDGATE SMILEDAND SHOOK HIS HEAD
 NOR OF MINE EITHER PROPERLY I SUPPOSE
 YOU WILLHEAR THAT PIPE ALLEGED AGAINST ME BY BULSTRODE AND COMPANY
 THEY DONTKNOW HOW PLEASED THE DEVIL WOULD BE IF I GAVE IT UP
I UNDERSTAND
 YOU ARE OF AN EXCITABLE TEMPER AND WANT A SEDATIVE
 I AMHEAVIER AND SHOULD GET IDLE WITH IT
 I SHOULD RUSH INTO IDLENESS ANDSTAGNATE THERE WITH ALL MY MIGHT
AND YOU MEAN TO GIVE IT ALL TO YOUR WORK
 I AM SOME TEN OR TWELVEYEARS OLDER THAN YOU AND HAVE COME TO A COMPROMISE
 I FEED A WEAKNESSOR TWO LEST THEY SHOULD GET CLAMOROUS
 SEE CONTINUED THE VICAROPENING SEVERAL SMALL DRAWERS I FANCY I HAVE MADE AN EXHAUSTIVE STUDYOF THE ENTOMOLOGY OF THIS DISTRICT
 I AM GOING ON BOTH WITH THE FAUNAAND FLORA BUT I HAVE AT LEAST DONE MY INSECTS WELL
 WE ARE SINGULARLYRICH IN ORTHOPTERA I DONT KNOW WHETHERAH
 YOU HAVE GOT HOLD OF THATGLASS JARYOU ARE LOOKING INTO THAT INSTEAD OF MY DRAWERS
 YOU DONTREALLY CARE ABOUT THESE THINGS
NOT BY THE SIDE OF THIS LOVELY ANENCEPHALOUS MONSTER
 I HAVE NEVER HADTIME TO GIVE MYSELF MUCH TO NATURAL HISTORY
 I WAS EARLY BITTEN WITH ANINTEREST IN STRUCTURE AND IT IS WHAT LIES MOST DIRECTLY IN MYPROFESSION
 I HAVE NO HOBBY BESIDES
 I HAVE THE SEA TO SWIM IN THERE
AH
 YOU ARE A HAPPY FELLOW SAID MR
 FAREBROTHER TURNING ON HIS HEELAND BEGINNING TO FILL HIS PIPE
 YOU DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS TO WANTSPIRITUAL TOBACCOBAD EMENDATIONS OF OLD TEXTS OR SMALL ITEMS ABOUT AVARIETY OF APHIS BRASSICAE WITH THE WELLKNOWN SIGNATURE OFPHILOMICRON FOR THE TWADDLERS MAGAZINE OR A LEARNED TREATISE ONTHE ENTOMOLOGY OF THE PENTATEUCH INCLUDING ALL THE INSECTS NOTMENTIONED BUT PROBABLY MET WITH BY THE ISRAELITES IN THEIR PASSAGETHROUGH THE DESERT WITH A MONOGRAPH ON THE ANT AS TREATED BY SOLOMONSHOWING THE HARMONY OF THE BOOK OF PROVERBS WITH THE RESULTS OF MODERNRESEARCH
 YOU DONT MIND MY FUMIGATING YOU
LYDGATE WAS MORE SURPRISED AT THE OPENNESS OF THIS TALK THAN AT ITSIMPLIED MEANINGTHAT THE VICAR FELT HIMSELF NOT ALTOGETHER IN THE RIGHTVOCATION
 THE NEAT FITTINGUP OF DRAWERS AND SHELVES AND THE BOOKCASEFILLED WITH EXPENSIVE ILLUSTRATED BOOKS ON NATURAL HISTORY MADE HIMTHINK AGAIN OF THE WINNINGS AT CARDS AND THEIR DESTINATION
 BUT HE WASBEGINNING TO WISH THAT THE VERY BEST CONSTRUCTION OF EVERYTHING THATMR
 FAREBROTHER DID SHOULD BE THE TRUE ONE
 THE VICARS FRANKNESSSEEMED NOT OF THE REPULSIVE SORT THAT COMES FROM AN UNEASYCONSCIOUSNESS SEEKING TO FORESTALL THE JUDGMENT OF OTHERS BUT SIMPLYTHE RELIEF OF A DESIRE TO DO WITH AS LITTLE PRETENCE AS POSSIBLE
APPARENTLY HE WAS NOT WITHOUT A SENSE THAT HIS FREEDOM OF SPEECH MIGHTSEEM PREMATURE FOR HE PRESENTLY SAIDI HAVE NOT YET TOLD YOU THAT I HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF YOU MR
 LYDGATEAND KNOW YOU BETTER THAN YOU KNOW ME
 YOU REMEMBER TRAWLEY WHO SHAREDYOUR APARTMENT AT PARIS FOR SOME TIME
 I WAS A CORRESPONDENT OF HISAND HE TOLD ME A GOOD DEAL ABOUT YOU
 I WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHEN YOUFIRST CAME THAT YOU WERE THE SAME MAN
 I WAS VERY GLAD WHEN I FOUNDTHAT YOU WERE
 ONLY I DONT FORGET THAT YOU HAVE NOT HAD THE LIKEPROLOGUE ABOUT ME
LYDGATE DIVINED SOME DELICACY OF FEELING HERE BUT DID NOT HALFUNDERSTAND IT
 BY THE WAY HE SAID WHAT HAS BECOME OF TRAWLEY
 IHAVE QUITE LOST SIGHT OF HIM
 HE WAS HOT ON THE FRENCH SOCIAL SYSTEMSAND TALKED OF GOING TO THE BACKWOODS TO FOUND A SORT OF PYTHAGOREANCOMMUNITY
 IS HE GONE
NOT AT ALL
 HE IS PRACTISING AT A GERMAN BATH AND HAS MARRIED A RICHPATIENT
THEN MY NOTIONS WEAR THE BEST SO FAR SAID LYDGATE WITH A SHORTSCORNFUL LAUGH
 HE WOULD HAVE IT THE MEDICAL PROFESSION WAS ANINEVITABLE SYSTEM OF HUMBUG
 I SAID THE FAULT WAS IN THE MENMEN WHOTRUCKLE TO LIES AND FOLLY
 INSTEAD OF PREACHING AGAINST HUMBUG OUTSIDETHE WALLS IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO SET UP A DISINFECTING APPARATUSWITHIN
 IN SHORTI AM REPORTING MY OWN CONVERSATIONYOU MAY BE SURE IHAD ALL THE GOOD SENSE ON MY SIDE
YOUR SCHEME IS A GOOD DEAL MORE DIFFICULT TO CARRY OUT THAN THEPYTHAGOREAN COMMUNITY THOUGH
 YOU HAVE NOT ONLY GOT THE OLD ADAM INYOURSELF AGAINST YOU BUT YOU HAVE GOT ALL THOSE DESCENDANTS OF THEORIGINAL ADAM WHO FORM THE SOCIETY AROUND YOU
 YOU SEE I HAVE PAIDTWELVE OR THIRTEEN YEARS MORE THAN YOU FOR MY KNOWLEDGE OFDIFFICULTIES
 BUTMR
 FAREBROTHER BROKE OFF A MOMENT AND THEN ADDEDYOU ARE EYING THAT GLASS VASE AGAIN
 DO YOU WANT TO MAKE AN EXCHANGE
YOU SHALL NOT HAVE IT WITHOUT A FAIR BARTER
I HAVE SOME SEAMICEFINE SPECIMENSIN SPIRITS
 AND I WILL THROW INROBERT BROWNS NEW THINGMICROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS ON THE POLLEN OFPLANTSIF YOU DONT HAPPEN TO HAVE IT ALREADY
WHY SEEING HOW YOU LONG FOR THE MONSTER I MIGHT ASK A HIGHER PRICE
SUPPOSE I ASK YOU TO LOOK THROUGH MY DRAWERS AND AGREE WITH ME ABOUTALL MY NEW SPECIES
 THE VICAR WHILE HE TALKED IN THIS WAYALTERNATELY MOVED ABOUT WITH HIS PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND RETURNED TOHANG RATHER FONDLY OVER HIS DRAWERS
 THAT WOULD BE GOOD DISCIPLINEYOU KNOW FOR A YOUNG DOCTOR WHO HAS TO PLEASE HIS PATIENTS INMIDDLEMARCH
 YOU MUST LEARN TO BE BORED REMEMBER
 HOWEVER YOU SHALLHAVE THE MONSTER ON YOUR OWN TERMS
DONT YOU THINK MEN OVERRATE THE NECESSITY FOR HUMORING EVERYBODYSNONSENSE TILL THEY GET DESPISED BY THE VERY FOOLS THEY HUMOR
 SAIDLYDGATE MOVING TO MR
 FAREBROTHERS SIDE AND LOOKING RATHER ABSENTLYAT THE INSECTS RANGED IN FINE GRADATION WITH NAMES SUBSCRIBED INEXQUISITE WRITING
 THE SHORTEST WAY IS TO MAKE YOUR VALUE FELT SOTHAT PEOPLE MUST PUT UP WITH YOU WHETHER YOU FLATTER THEM OR NOT
WITH ALL MY HEART
 BUT THEN YOU MUST BE SURE OF HAVING THE VALUE ANDYOU MUST KEEP YOURSELF INDEPENDENT
 VERY FEW MEN CAN DO THAT
 EITHERYOU SLIP OUT OF SERVICE ALTOGETHER AND BECOME GOOD FOR NOTHING OR YOUWEAR THE HARNESS AND DRAW A GOOD DEAL WHERE YOUR YOKEFELLOWS PULL YOU
BUT DO LOOK AT THESE DELICATE ORTHOPTERA
LYDGATE HAD AFTER ALL TO GIVE SOME SCRUTINY TO EACH DRAWER THE VICARLAUGHING AT HIMSELF AND YET PERSISTING IN THE EXHIBITION
APROPOS OF WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT WEARING HARNESS LYDGATE BEGAN AFTERTHEY HAD SAT DOWN I MADE UP MY MIND SOME TIME AGO TO DO WITH ASLITTLE OF IT AS POSSIBLE
 THAT WAS WHY I DETERMINED NOT TO TRY ANYTHINGIN LONDON FOR A GOOD MANY YEARS AT LEAST
 I DIDNT LIKE WHAT I SAWWHEN I WAS STUDYING THERESO MUCH EMPTY BIGWIGGISM AND OBSTRUCTIVETRICKERY
 IN THE COUNTRY PEOPLE HAVE LESS PRETENSION TO KNOWLEDGE ANDARE LESS OF COMPANIONS BUT FOR THAT REASON THEY AFFECT ONESAMOURPROPRE LESS ONE MAKES LESS BAD BLOOD AND CAN FOLLOW ONES OWNCOURSE MORE QUIETLY
YESWELLYOU HAVE GOT A GOOD START YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT PROFESSIONTHE WORK YOU FEEL YOURSELF MOST FIT FOR
 SOME PEOPLE MISS THAT ANDREPENT TOO LATE
 BUT YOU MUST NOT BE TOO SURE OF KEEPING YOURINDEPENDENCE
YOU MEAN OF FAMILY TIES
 SAID LYDGATE CONCEIVING THAT THESE MIGHTPRESS RATHER TIGHTLY ON MR
 FAREBROTHER
NOT ALTOGETHER
 OF COURSE THEY MAKE MANY THINGS MORE DIFFICULT
 BUT AGOOD WIFEA GOOD UNWORLDLY WOMANMAY REALLY HELP A MAN AND KEEP HIMMORE INDEPENDENT
 THERES A PARISHIONER OF MINEA FINE FELLOW BUT WHOWOULD HARDLY HAVE PULLED THROUGH AS HE HAS DONE WITHOUT HIS WIFE
 DOYOU KNOW THE GARTHS
 I THINK THEY WERE NOT PEACOCKS PATIENTS
NO BUT THERE IS A MISS GARTH AT OLD FEATHERSTONES AT LOWICK
THEIR DAUGHTER AN EXCELLENT GIRL
SHE IS VERY QUIETI HAVE HARDLY NOTICED HER
SHE HAS TAKEN NOTICE OF YOU THOUGH DEPEND UPON IT
I DONT UNDERSTAND SAID LYDGATE HE COULD HARDLY SAY OF COURSE
OH SHE GAUGES EVERYBODY
 I PREPARED HER FOR CONFIRMATIONSHE IS AFAVORITE OF MINE
MR
 FAREBROTHER PUFFED A FEW MOMENTS IN SILENCE LYDGATE NOT CARING TOKNOW MORE ABOUT THE GARTHS
 AT LAST THE VICAR LAID DOWN HIS PIPESTRETCHED OUT HIS LEGS AND TURNED HIS BRIGHT EYES WITH A SMILE TOWARDSLYDGATE SAYINGBUT WE MIDDLEMARCHERS ARE NOT SO TAME AS YOU TAKE US TO BE
 WE HAVEOUR INTRIGUES AND OUR PARTIES
 I AM A PARTY MAN FOR EXAMPLE ANDBULSTRODE IS ANOTHER
 IF YOU VOTE FOR ME YOU WILL OFFEND BULSTRODE
WHAT IS THERE AGAINST BULSTRODE
 SAID LYDGATE EMPHATICALLY
I DID NOT SAY THERE WAS ANYTHING AGAINST HIM EXCEPT THAT
 IF YOU VOTEAGAINST HIM YOU WILL MAKE HIM YOUR ENEMY
I DONT KNOW THAT I NEED MIND ABOUT THAT SAID LYDGATE RATHERPROUDLY BUT HE SEEMS TO HAVE GOOD IDEAS ABOUT HOSPITALS AND HESPENDS LARGE SUMS ON USEFUL PUBLIC OBJECTS
 HE MIGHT HELP ME A GOODDEAL IN CARRYING OUT MY IDEAS
 AS TO HIS RELIGIOUS NOTIONSWHY ASVOLTAIRE SAID INCANTATIONS WILL DESTROY A FLOCK OF SHEEP IFADMINISTERED WITH A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF ARSENIC
 I LOOK FOR THE MAN WHOWILL BRING THE ARSENIC AND DONT MIND ABOUT HIS INCANTATIONS
VERY GOOD
 BUT THEN YOU MUST NOT OFFEND YOUR ARSENICMAN
 YOU WILL NOTOFFEND ME YOU KNOW SAID MR
 FAREBROTHER QUITE UNAFFECTEDLY
 IDONT TRANSLATE MY OWN CONVENIENCE INTO OTHER PEOPLES DUTIES
 I AMOPPOSED TO BULSTRODE IN MANY WAYS
 I DONT LIKE THE SET HE BELONGS TOTHEY ARE A NARROW IGNORANT SET AND DO MORE TO MAKE THEIR NEIGHBORSUNCOMFORTABLE THAN TO MAKE THEM BETTER
 THEIR SYSTEM IS A SORT OFWORLDLYSPIRITUAL CLIQUEISM THEY REALLY LOOK ON THE REST OF MANKIND ASA DOOMED CARCASS WHICH IS TO NOURISH THEM FOR HEAVEN
 BUT HE ADDEDSMILINGLY I DONT SAY THAT BULSTRODES NEW HOSPITAL IS A BAD THINGAND AS TO HIS WANTING TO OUST ME FROM THE OLD ONEWHY IF HE THINKS MEA MISCHIEVOUS FELLOW HE IS ONLY RETURNING A COMPLIMENT
 AND I AM NOT AMODEL CLERGYMANONLY A DECENT MAKESHIFT
LYDGATE WAS NOT AT ALL SURE THAT THE VICAR MALIGNED HIMSELF
 A MODELCLERGYMAN LIKE A MODEL DOCTOR OUGHT TO THINK HIS OWN PROFESSION THEFINEST IN THE WORLD AND TAKE ALL KNOWLEDGE AS MERE NOURISHMENT TO HISMORAL PATHOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS
 HE ONLY SAID WHAT REASON DOESBULSTRODE GIVE FOR SUPERSEDING YOU
THAT I DONT TEACH HIS OPINIONSWHICH HE CALLS SPIRITUAL RELIGION ANDTHAT I HAVE NO TIME TO SPARE
 BOTH STATEMENTS ARE TRUE
 BUT THEN ICOULD MAKE TIME AND I SHOULD BE GLAD OF THE FORTY POUNDS
 THAT IS THEPLAIN FACT OF THE CASE
 BUT LET US DISMISS IT
 I ONLY WANTED TO TELLYOU THAT IF YOU VOTE FOR YOUR ARSENICMAN YOU ARE NOT TO CUT ME INCONSEQUENCE
 I CANT SPARE YOU
 YOU ARE A SORT OF CIRCUMNAVIGATOR COMETO SETTLE AMONG US AND WILL KEEP UP MY BELIEF IN THE ANTIPODES
 NOWTELL ME ALL ABOUT THEM IN PARIS
CHAPTER XVIII
OH SIR THE LOFTIEST HOPES ON EARTHDRAW LOTS WITH MEANER HOPES HEROIC BREASTSBREATHING BAD AIR RUN RISK OF PESTILENCEOR LACKING LIMEJUICE WHEN THEY CROSS THE LINEMAY LANGUISH WITH THE SCURVY
SOME WEEKS PASSED AFTER THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE THE QUESTION OF THECHAPLAINCY GATHERED ANY PRACTICAL IMPORT FOR LYDGATE AND WITHOUTTELLING HIMSELF THE REASON HE DEFERRED THE PREDETERMINATION ON WHICHSIDE HE SHOULD GIVE HIS VOTE
 IT WOULD REALLY HAVE BEEN A MATTER OFTOTAL INDIFFERENCE TO HIMTHAT IS TO SAY HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE MORECONVENIENT SIDE AND GIVEN HIS VOTE FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF TYKE WITHOUTANY HESITATIONIF HE HAD NOT CARED PERSONALLY FOR MR
 FAREBROTHER
BUT HIS LIKING FOR THE VICAR OF ST
 BOTOLPHS GREW WITH GROWINGACQUAINTANCESHIP
 THAT ENTERING INTO LYDGATES POSITION AS A NEWCOMERWHO HAD HIS OWN PROFESSIONAL OBJECTS TO SECURE MR
 FAREBROTHER SHOULDHAVE TAKEN PAINS RATHER TO WARN OFF THAN TO OBTAIN HIS INTEREST SHOWEDAN UNUSUAL DELICACY AND GENEROSITY WHICH LYDGATES NATURE WAS KEENLYALIVE TO
 IT WENT ALONG WITH OTHER POINTS OF CONDUCT IN MR
 FAREBROTHERWHICH WERE EXCEPTIONALLY FINE AND MADE HIS CHARACTER RESEMBLE THOSESOUTHERN LANDSCAPES WHICH SEEM DIVIDED BETWEEN NATURAL GRANDEUR ANDSOCIAL SLOVENLINESS
 VERY FEW MEN COULD HAVE BEEN AS FILIAL ANDCHIVALROUS AS HE WAS TO THE MOTHER AUNT AND SISTER WHOSE DEPENDENCEON HIM HAD IN MANY WAYS SHAPED HIS LIFE RATHER UNEASILY FOR HIMSELFFEW MEN WHO FEEL THE PRESSURE OF SMALL NEEDS ARE SO NOBLY RESOLUTE NOTTO DRESS UP THEIR INEVITABLY SELFINTERESTED DESIRES IN A PRETEXT OFBETTER MOTIVES
 IN THESE MATTERS HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HIS LIFE WOULDBEAR THE CLOSEST SCRUTINY AND PERHAPS THE CONSCIOUSNESS ENCOURAGED ALITTLE DEFIANCE TOWARDS THE CRITICAL STRICTNESS OF PERSONS WHOSECELESTIAL INTIMACIES SEEMED NOT TO IMPROVE THEIR DOMESTIC MANNERS ANDWHOSE LOFTY AIMS WERE NOT NEEDED TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR ACTIONS
 THENHIS PREACHING WAS INGENIOUS AND PITHY LIKE THE PREACHING OF THEENGLISH CHURCH IN ITS ROBUST AGE AND HIS SERMONS WERE DELIVEREDWITHOUT BOOK
 PEOPLE OUTSIDE HIS PARISH WENT TO HEAR HIM AND SINCE TOFILL THE CHURCH WAS ALWAYS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF A CLERGYMANSFUNCTION HERE WAS ANOTHER GROUND FOR A CARELESS SENSE OF SUPERIORITY
BESIDES HE WAS A LIKABLE MAN SWEETTEMPERED READYWITTED FRANKWITHOUT GRINS OF SUPPRESSED BITTERNESS OR OTHER CONVERSATIONAL FLAVORSWHICH MAKE HALF OF US AN AFFLICTION TO OUR FRIENDS
 LYDGATE LIKED HIMHEARTILY AND WISHED FOR HIS FRIENDSHIP
WITH THIS FEELING UPPERMOST HE CONTINUED TO WAIVE THE QUESTION OF THECHAPLAINCY AND TO PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT IT WAS NOT ONLY NO PROPERBUSINESS OF HIS BUT LIKELY ENOUGH NEVER TO VEX HIM WITH A DEMAND FORHIS VOTE
 LYDGATE AT MR
 BULSTRODES REQUEST WAS LAYING DOWN PLANSFOR THE INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS OF THE NEW HOSPITAL AND THE TWO WEREOFTEN IN CONSULTATION
 THE BANKER WAS ALWAYS PRESUPPOSING THAT HE COULDCOUNT IN GENERAL ON LYDGATE AS A COADJUTOR BUT MADE NO SPECIALRECURRENCE TO THE COMING DECISION BETWEEN TYKE AND FAREBROTHER
 WHENTHE GENERAL BOARD OF THE INFIRMARY HAD MET HOWEVER AND LYDGATE HADNOTICE THAT THE QUESTION OF THE CHAPLAINCY WAS THROWN ON A COUNCIL OFTHE DIRECTORS AND MEDICAL MEN TO MEET ON THE FOLLOWING FRIDAY HE HADA VEXED SENSE THAT HE MUST MAKE UP HIS MIND ON THIS TRIVIAL MIDDLEMARCHBUSINESS
 HE COULD NOT HELP HEARING WITHIN HIM THE DISTINCT DECLARATIONTHAT BULSTRODE WAS PRIME MINISTER AND THAT THE TYKE AFFAIR WAS AQUESTION OF OFFICE OR NO OFFICE AND HE COULD NOT HELP AN EQUALLYPRONOUNCED DISLIKE TO GIVING UP THE PROSPECT OF OFFICE
 FOR HISOBSERVATION WAS CONSTANTLY CONFIRMING MR
 FAREBROTHERS ASSURANCE THATTHE BANKER WOULD NOT OVERLOOK OPPOSITION
 CONFOUND THEIR PETTYPOLITICS
 WAS ONE OF HIS THOUGHTS FOR THREE MORNINGS IN THE MEDITATIVEPROCESS OF SHAVING WHEN HE HAD BEGUN TO FEEL THAT HE MUST REALLY HOLDA COURT OF CONSCIENCE ON THIS MATTER
 CERTAINLY THERE WERE VALID THINGSTO BE SAID AGAINST THE ELECTION OF MR
 FAREBROTHER HE HAD TOO MUCH ONHIS HANDS ALREADY ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING HOW MUCH TIME HE SPENT ONNONCLERICAL OCCUPATIONS
 THEN AGAIN IT WAS A CONTINUALLY REPEATEDSHOCK DISTURBING LYDGATES ESTEEM THAT THE VICAR SHOULD OBVIOUSLYPLAY FOR THE SAKE OF MONEY LIKING THE PLAY INDEED BUT EVIDENTLYLIKING SOME END WHICH IT SERVED
 MR
 FAREBROTHER CONTENDED ON THEORYFOR THE DESIRABILITY OF ALL GAMES AND SAID THAT ENGLISHMENS WIT WASSTAGNANT FOR WANT OF THEM BUT LYDGATE FELT CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD HAVEPLAYED VERY MUCH LESS BUT FOR THE MONEY
 THERE WAS A BILLIARDROOM ATTHE GREEN DRAGON WHICH SOME ANXIOUS MOTHERS AND WIVES REGARDED AS THECHIEF TEMPTATION IN MIDDLEMARCH
 THE VICAR WAS A FIRSTRATEBILLIARDPLAYER AND THOUGH HE DID NOT FREQUENT THE GREEN DRAGON THEREWERE REPORTS THAT HE HAD SOMETIMES BEEN THERE IN THE DAYTIME AND HADWON MONEY
 AND AS TO THE CHAPLAINCY HE DID NOT PRETEND THAT HE CAREDFOR IT EXCEPT FOR THE SAKE OF THE FORTY POUNDS
 LYDGATE WAS NOPURITAN BUT HE DID NOT CARE FOR PLAY AND WINNING MONEY AT IT HADALWAYS SEEMED A MEANNESS TO HIM BESIDES HE HAD AN IDEAL OF LIFE WHICHMADE THIS SUBSERVIENCE OF CONDUCT TO THE GAINING OF SMALL SUMSTHOROUGHLY HATEFUL TO HIM
 HITHERTO IN HIS OWN LIFE HIS WANTS HAD BEENSUPPLIED WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE TO HIMSELF AND HIS FIRST IMPULSE WASALWAYS TO BE LIBERAL WITH HALFCROWNS AS MATTERS OF NO IMPORTANCE TO AGENTLEMAN IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM TO DEVISE A PLAN FOR GETTINGHALFCROWNS
 HE HAD ALWAYS KNOWN IN A GENERAL WAY THAT HE WAS NOT RICHBUT HE HAD NEVER FELT POOR AND HE HAD NO POWER OF IMAGINING THE PARTWHICH THE WANT OF MONEY PLAYS IN DETERMINING THE ACTIONS OF MEN
 MONEYHAD NEVER BEEN A MOTIVE TO HIM
 HENCE HE WAS NOT READY TO FRAME EXCUSESFOR THIS DELIBERATE PURSUIT OF SMALL GAINS
 IT WAS ALTOGETHER REPULSIVETO HIM AND HE NEVER ENTERED INTO ANY CALCULATION OF THE RATIO BETWEENTHE VICARS INCOME AND HIS MORE OR LESS NECESSARY EXPENDITURE
 IT WASPOSSIBLE THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE MADE SUCH A CALCULATION IN HIS OWNCASE
AND NOW WHEN THE QUESTION OF VOTING HAD COME THIS REPULSIVE FACT TOLDMORE STRONGLY AGAINST MR
 FAREBROTHER THAN IT HAD DONE BEFORE
 ONEWOULD KNOW MUCH BETTER WHAT TO DO IF MENS CHARACTERS WERE MORECONSISTENT AND ESPECIALLY IF ONES FRIENDS WERE INVARIABLY FIT FOR ANYFUNCTION THEY DESIRED TO UNDERTAKE
 LYDGATE WAS CONVINCED THAT IF THEREHAD BEEN NO VALID OBJECTION TO MR
 FAREBROTHER HE WOULD HAVE VOTED FORHIM WHATEVER BULSTRODE MIGHT HAVE FELT ON THE SUBJECT HE DID NOTINTEND TO BE A VASSAL OF BULSTRODES
 ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WASTYKE A MAN ENTIRELY GIVEN TO HIS CLERICAL OFFICE WHO WAS SIMPLYCURATE AT A CHAPEL OF EASE IN ST
 PETERS PARISH AND HAD TIME FOREXTRA DUTY
 NOBODY HAD ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST MR
 TYKE EXCEPT THATTHEY COULD NOT BEAR HIM AND SUSPECTED HIM OF CANT
 REALLY FROM HISPOINT OF VIEW BULSTRODE WAS THOROUGHLY JUSTIFIED
BUT WHICHEVER WAY LYDGATE BEGAN TO INCLINE THERE WAS SOMETHING TO MAKEHIM WINCE AND BEING A PROUD MAN HE WAS A LITTLE EXASPERATED AT BEINGOBLIGED TO WINCE
 HE DID NOT LIKE FRUSTRATING HIS OWN BEST PURPOSES BYGETTING ON BAD TERMS WITH BULSTRODE HE DID NOT LIKE VOTING AGAINSTFAREBROTHER AND HELPING TO DEPRIVE HIM OF FUNCTION AND SALARY AND THEQUESTION OCCURRED WHETHER THE ADDITIONAL FORTY POUNDS MIGHT NOT LEAVETHE VICAR FREE FROM THAT IGNOBLE CARE ABOUT WINNING AT CARDS
 MOREOVERLYDGATE DID NOT LIKE THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IN VOTING FOR TYKE HESHOULD BE VOTING ON THE SIDE OBVIOUSLY CONVENIENT FOR HIMSELF
 BUTWOULD THE END REALLY BE HIS OWN CONVENIENCE
 OTHER PEOPLE WOULD SAY SOAND WOULD ALLEGE THAT HE WAS CURRYING FAVOR WITH BULSTRODE FOR THE SAKEOF MAKING HIMSELF IMPORTANT AND GETTING ON IN THE WORLD
 WHAT THEN
 HEFOR HIS OWN PART KNEW THAT IF HIS PERSONAL PROSPECTS SIMPLY HAD BEENCONCERNED HE WOULD NOT HAVE CARED A ROTTEN NUT FOR THE BANKERSFRIENDSHIP OR ENMITY
 WHAT HE REALLY CARED FOR WAS A MEDIUM FOR HISWORK A VEHICLE FOR HIS IDEAS AND AFTER ALL WAS HE NOT BOUND TOPREFER THE OBJECT OF GETTING A GOOD HOSPITAL WHERE HE COULDDEMONSTRATE THE SPECIFIC DISTINCTIONS OF FEVER AND TEST THERAPEUTICRESULTS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE CONNECTED WITH THIS CHAPLAINCY
 FOR THEFIRST TIME LYDGATE WAS FEELING THE HAMPERING THREADLIKE PRESSURE OFSMALL SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND THEIR FRUSTRATING COMPLEXITY
 AT THE ENDOF HIS INWARD DEBATE WHEN HE SET OUT FOR THE HOSPITAL HIS HOPE WASREALLY IN THE CHANCE THAT DISCUSSION MIGHT SOMEHOW GIVE A NEW ASPECT TOTHE QUESTION AND MAKE THE SCALE DIP SO AS TO EXCLUDE THE NECESSITY FORVOTING
 I THINK HE TRUSTED A LITTLE ALSO TO THE ENERGY WHICH ISBEGOTTEN BY CIRCUMSTANCESSOME FEELING RUSHING WARMLY AND MAKINGRESOLVE EASY WHILE DEBATE IN COOL BLOOD HAD ONLY MADE IT MOREDIFFICULT
 HOWEVER IT WAS HE DID NOT DISTINCTLY SAY TO HIMSELF ONWHICH SIDE HE WOULD VOTE AND ALL THE WHILE HE WAS INWARDLY RESENTINGTHE SUBJECTION WHICH HAD BEEN FORCED UPON HIM
 IT WOULD HAVE SEEMEDBEFOREHAND LIKE A RIDICULOUS PIECE OF BAD LOGIC THAT HE WITH HISUNMIXED RESOLUTIONS OF INDEPENDENCE AND HIS SELECT PURPOSES WOULD FINDHIMSELF AT THE VERY OUTSET IN THE GRASP OF PETTY ALTERNATIVES EACH OFWHICH WAS REPUGNANT TO HIM
 IN HIS STUDENTS CHAMBERS HE HADPREARRANGED HIS SOCIAL ACTION QUITE DIFFERENTLY
LYDGATE WAS LATE IN SETTING OUT BUT DR
 SPRAGUE THE TWO OTHERSURGEONS AND SEVERAL OF THE DIRECTORS HAD ARRIVED EARLY MR
BULSTRODE TREASURER AND CHAIRMAN BEING AMONG THOSE WHO WERE STILLABSENT
 THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT THE ISSUE WASPROBLEMATICAL AND THAT A MAJORITY FOR TYKE WAS NOT SO CERTAIN AS HADBEEN GENERALLY SUPPOSED
 THE TWO PHYSICIANS FOR A WONDER TURNED OUTTO BE UNANIMOUS OR RATHER THOUGH OF DIFFERENT MINDS THEY CONCURREDIN ACTION
 DR
 SPRAGUE THE RUGGED AND WEIGHTY WAS AS EVERY ONE HADFORESEEN AN ADHERENT OF MR
 FAREBROTHER
 THE DOCTOR WAS MORE THANSUSPECTED OF HAVING NO RELIGION BUT SOMEHOW MIDDLEMARCH TOLERATED THISDEFICIENCY IN HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN A LORD CHANCELLOR INDEED IT ISPROBABLE THAT HIS PROFESSIONAL WEIGHT WAS THE MORE BELIEVED IN THEWORLDOLD ASSOCIATION OF CLEVERNESS WITH THE EVIL PRINCIPLE BEING STILLPOTENT IN THE MINDS EVEN OF LADYPATIENTS WHO HAD THE STRICTEST IDEASOF FRILLING AND SENTIMENT
 IT WAS PERHAPS THIS NEGATION IN THE DOCTORWHICH MADE HIS NEIGHBORS CALL HIM HARDHEADED AND DRYWITTEDCONDITIONS OF TEXTURE WHICH WERE ALSO HELD FAVORABLE TO THE STORING OFJUDGMENTS CONNECTED WITH DRUGS
 AT ALL EVENTS IT IS CERTAIN THAT IFANY MEDICAL MAN HAD COME TO MIDDLEMARCH WITH THE REPUTATION OF HAVINGVERY DEFINITE RELIGIOUS VIEWS OF BEING GIVEN TO PRAYER AND OFOTHERWISE SHOWING AN ACTIVE PIETY THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A GENERALPRESUMPTION AGAINST HIS MEDICAL SKILL
ON THIS GROUND IT WAS PROFESSIONALLY SPEAKING FORTUNATE FOR DR
MINCHIN THAT HIS RELIGIOUS SYMPATHIES WERE OF A GENERAL KIND AND SUCHAS GAVE A DISTANT MEDICAL SANCTION TO ALL SERIOUS SENTIMENT WHETHER OFCHURCH OR DISSENT RATHER THAN ANY ADHESION TO PARTICULAR TENETS
 IFMR
 BULSTRODE INSISTED AS HE WAS APT TO DO ON THE LUTHERAN DOCTRINEOF JUSTIFICATION AS THAT BY WHICH A CHURCH MUST STAND OR FALL DR
MINCHIN IN RETURN WAS QUITE SURE THAT MAN WAS NOT A MERE MACHINE OR AFORTUITOUS CONJUNCTION OF ATOMS IF MRS
 WIMPLE INSISTED ON APARTICULAR PROVIDENCE IN RELATION TO HER STOMACH COMPLAINT DR
 MINCHINFOR HIS PART LIKED TO KEEP THE MENTAL WINDOWS OPEN AND OBJECTED TOFIXED LIMITS IF THE UNITARIAN BREWER JESTED ABOUT THE ATHANASIANCREED DR
 MINCHIN QUOTED POPES ESSAY ON MAN
 HE OBJECTED TO THERATHER FREE STYLE OF ANECDOTE IN WHICH DR
 SPRAGUE INDULGED PREFERRINGWELLSANCTIONED QUOTATIONS AND LIKING REFINEMENT OF ALL KINDS IT WASGENERALLY KNOWN THAT HE HAD SOME KINSHIP TO A BISHOP AND SOMETIMESSPENT HIS HOLIDAYS AT THE PALACE
DR
 MINCHIN WAS SOFTHANDED PALECOMPLEXIONED AND OF ROUNDED OUTLINENOT TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM A MILD CLERGYMAN IN APPEARANCE WHEREASDR
 SPRAGUE WAS SUPERFLUOUSLY TALL HIS TROUSERS GOT CREASED AT THEKNEES AND SHOWED AN EXCESS OF BOOT AT A TIME WHEN STRAPS SEEMEDNECESSARY TO ANY DIGNITY OF BEARING YOU HEARD HIM GO IN AND OUT ANDUP AND DOWN AS IF HE HAD COME TO SEE AFTER THE ROOFING
 IN SHORT HEHAD WEIGHT AND MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO GRAPPLE WITH A DISEASE AND THROWIT WHILE DR
 MINCHIN MIGHT BE BETTER ABLE TO DETECT IT LURKING AND TOCIRCUMVENT IT
 THEY ENJOYED ABOUT EQUALLY THE MYSTERIOUS PRIVILEGE OFMEDICAL REPUTATION AND CONCEALED WITH MUCH ETIQUETTE THEIR CONTEMPTFOR EACH OTHERS SKILL
 REGARDING THEMSELVES AS MIDDLEMARCHINSTITUTIONS THEY WERE READY TO COMBINE AGAINST ALL INNOVATORS ANDAGAINST NONPROFESSIONALS GIVEN TO INTERFERENCE
 ON THIS GROUND THEYWERE BOTH IN THEIR HEARTS EQUALLY AVERSE TO MR
 BULSTRODE THOUGH DR
MINCHIN HAD NEVER BEEN IN OPEN HOSTILITY WITH HIM AND NEVER DIFFEREDFROM HIM WITHOUT ELABORATE EXPLANATION TO MRS
 BULSTRODE WHO HAD FOUNDTHAT DR
 MINCHIN ALONE UNDERSTOOD HER CONSTITUTION
 A LAYMAN WHO PRIEDINTO THE PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT OF MEDICAL MEN AND WAS ALWAYS OBTRUDINGHIS REFORMSTHOUGH HE WAS LESS DIRECTLY EMBARRASSING TO THE TWOPHYSICIANS THAN TO THE SURGEONAPOTHECARIES WHO ATTENDED PAUPERS BYCONTRACT WAS NEVERTHELESS OFFENSIVE TO THE PROFESSIONAL NOSTRIL ASSUCH AND DR
 MINCHIN SHARED FULLY IN THE NEW PIQUE AGAINST BULSTRODEEXCITED BY HIS APPARENT DETERMINATION TO PATRONIZE LYDGATE
 THELONGESTABLISHED PRACTITIONERS MR
 WRENCH AND MR
 TOLLER WERE JUSTNOW STANDING APART AND HAVING A FRIENDLY COLLOQUY IN WHICH THEY AGREEDTHAT LYDGATE WAS A JACKANAPES JUST MADE TO SERVE BULSTRODES PURPOSE
TO NONMEDICAL FRIENDS THEY HAD ALREADY CONCURRED IN PRAISING THE OTHERYOUNG PRACTITIONER WHO HAD COME INTO THE TOWN ON MR
 PEACOCKSRETIREMENT WITHOUT FURTHER RECOMMENDATION THAN HIS OWN MERITS AND SUCHARGUMENT FOR SOLID PROFESSIONAL ACQUIREMENT AS MIGHT BE GATHERED FROMHIS HAVING APPARENTLY WASTED NO TIME ON OTHER BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE
 ITWAS CLEAR THAT LYDGATE BY NOT DISPENSING DRUGS INTENDED TO CASTIMPUTATIONS ON HIS EQUALS AND ALSO TO OBSCURE THE LIMIT BETWEEN HISOWN RANK AS A GENERAL PRACTITIONER AND THAT OF THE PHYSICIANS WHO INTHE INTEREST OF THE PROFESSION FELT BOUND TO MAINTAIN ITS VARIOUSGRADESESPECIALLY AGAINST A MAN WHO HAD NOT BEEN TO EITHER OF THEENGLISH UNIVERSITIES AND ENJOYED THE ABSENCE OF ANATOMICAL AND BEDSIDESTUDY THERE BUT CAME WITH A LIBELLOUS PRETENSION TO EXPERIENCE INEDINBURGH AND PARIS WHERE OBSERVATION MIGHT BE ABUNDANT INDEED BUTHARDLY SOUND
THUS IT HAPPENED THAT ON THIS OCCASION BULSTRODE BECAME IDENTIFIED WITHLYDGATE AND LYDGATE WITH TYKE AND OWING TO THIS VARIETY OFINTERCHANGEABLE NAMES FOR THE CHAPLAINCY QUESTION DIVERSE MINDS WEREENABLED TO FORM THE SAME JUDGMENT CONCERNING IT
DR
 SPRAGUE SAID AT ONCE BLUNTLY TO THE GROUP ASSEMBLED WHEN HEENTERED I GO FOR FAREBROTHER
 A SALARY WITH ALL MY HEART
 BUT WHYTAKE IT FROM THE VICAR
 HE HAS NONE TOO MUCHHAS TO INSURE HIS LIFEBESIDES KEEPING HOUSE AND DOING A VICARS CHARITIES
 PUT FORTY POUNDSIN HIS POCKET AND YOULL DO NO HARM
 HES A GOOD FELLOW ISFAREBROTHER WITH AS LITTLE OF THE PARSON ABOUT HIM AS WILL SERVE TOCARRY ORDERS
HO HO
 DOCTOR SAID OLD MR
 POWDERELL A RETIRED IRONMONGER OF SOMESTANDINGHIS INTERJECTION BEING SOMETHING BETWEEN A LAUGH AND APARLIAMENTARY DISAPPROVAL WE MUST LET YOU HAVE YOUR SAY
 BUT WHAT WEHAVE TO CONSIDER IS NOT ANYBODYS INCOMEITS THE SOULS OF THE POORSICK PEOPLEHERE MR
 POWDERELLS VOICE AND FACE HAD A SINCERE PATHOSIN THEM
 HE IS A REAL GOSPEL PREACHER IS MR
 TYKE
 I SHOULD VOTEAGAINST MY CONSCIENCE IF I VOTED AGAINST MR
 TYKEI SHOULD INDEED
MR
 TYKES OPPONENTS HAVE NOT ASKED ANY ONE TO VOTE AGAINST HISCONSCIENCE I BELIEVE SAID MR
 HACKBUTT A RICH TANNER OF FLUENTSPEECH WHOSE GLITTERING SPECTACLES AND ERECT HAIR WERE TURNED WITHSOME SEVERITY TOWARDS INNOCENT MR
 POWDERELL
 BUT IN MY JUDGMENT ITBEHOVES US AS DIRECTORS TO CONSIDER WHETHER WE WILL REGARD IT AS OURWHOLE BUSINESS TO CARRY OUT PROPOSITIONS EMANATING FROM A SINGLEQUARTER
 WILL ANY MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE AVER THAT HE WOULD HAVEENTERTAINED THE IDEA OF DISPLACING THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAS ALWAYSDISCHARGED THE FUNCTION OF CHAPLAIN HERE IF IT HAD NOT BEEN SUGGESTEDTO HIM BY PARTIES WHOSE DISPOSITION IT IS TO REGARD EVERY INSTITUTIONOF THIS TOWN AS A MACHINERY FOR CARRYING OUT THEIR OWN VIEWS
 I TAX NOMANS MOTIVES LET THEM LIE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND A HIGHER POWER BUT IDO SAY THAT THERE ARE INFLUENCES AT WORK HERE WHICH ARE INCOMPATIBLEWITH GENUINE INDEPENDENCE AND THAT A CRAWLING SERVILITY IS USUALLYDICTATED BY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH GENTLEMEN SO CONDUCTING THEMSELVESCOULD NOT AFFORD EITHER MORALLY OR FINANCIALLY TO AVOW
 I MYSELF AM ALAYMAN BUT I HAVE GIVEN NO INCONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO THE DIVISIONSIN THE CHURCH ANDOH DAMN THE DIVISIONS
 BURST IN MR
 FRANK HAWLEY LAWYER ANDTOWNCLERK WHO RARELY PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE BOARD BUT NOW LOOKEDIN HURRIEDLY WHIP IN HAND
 WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM HERE
FAREBROTHER HAS BEEN DOING THE WORKWHAT THERE WASWITHOUT PAY AND IFPAY IS TO BE GIVEN IT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO HIM
 I CALL IT A CONFOUNDEDJOB TO TAKE THE THING AWAY FROM FAREBROTHER
I THINK IT WOULD BE AS WELL FOR GENTLEMEN NOT TO GIVE THEIR REMARKS APERSONAL BEARING SAID MR
 PLYMDALE
 I SHALL VOTE FOR THE APPOINTMENTOF MR
 TYKE BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN IF MR
 HACKBUTT HADNT HINTEDIT THAT I WAS A SERVILE CRAWLER
I DISCLAIM ANY PERSONALITIES
 I EXPRESSLY SAID IF I MAY BE ALLOWED TOREPEAT OR EVEN TO CONCLUDE WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO SAYAH HERES MINCHIN
 SAID MR
 FRANK HAWLEY AT WHICH EVERYBODY TURNEDAWAY FROM MR
 HACKBUTT LEAVING HIM TO FEEL THE USELESSNESS OF SUPERIORGIFTS IN MIDDLEMARCH
 COME DOCTOR I MUST HAVE YOU ON THE RIGHT SIDEEH
I HOPE SO SAID DR
 MINCHIN NODDING AND SHAKING HANDS HERE ANDTHERE AT WHATEVER COST TO MY FEELINGS
IF THERES ANY FEELING HERE IT SHOULD BE FEELING FOR THE MAN WHO ISTURNED OUT I THINK SAID MR
 FRANK HAWLEY
I CONFESS I HAVE FEELINGS ON THE OTHER SIDE ALSO
 I HAVE A DIVIDEDESTEEM SAID DR
 MINCHIN RUBBING HIS HANDS
 I CONSIDER MR
 TYKE ANEXEMPLARY MANNONE MORE SOAND I BELIEVE HIM TO BE PROPOSED FROMUNIMPEACHABLE MOTIVES
 I FOR MY PART WISH THAT I COULD GIVE HIM MYVOTE
 BUT I AM CONSTRAINED TO TAKE A VIEW OF THE CASE WHICH GIVES THEPREPONDERANCE TO MR
 FAREBROTHERS CLAIMS
 HE IS AN AMIABLE MAN ANABLE PREACHER AND HAS BEEN LONGER AMONG US
OLD MR
 POWDERELL LOOKED ON SAD AND SILENT
 MR
 PLYMDALE SETTLED HISCRAVAT UNEASILY
YOU DONT SET UP FAREBROTHER AS A PATTERN OF WHAT A CLERGYMAN OUGHT TOBE I HOPE SAID MR
 LARCHER THE EMINENT CARRIER WHO HAD JUST COMEIN
 I HAVE NO ILLWILL TOWARDS HIM BUT I THINK WE OWE SOMETHING TOTHE PUBLIC NOT TO SPEAK OF ANYTHING HIGHER IN THESE APPOINTMENTS
 INMY OPINION FAREBROTHER IS TOO LAX FOR A CLERGYMAN
 I DONT WISH TOBRING UP PARTICULARS AGAINST HIM BUT HE WILL MAKE A LITTLE ATTENDANCEHERE GO AS FAR AS HE CAN
AND A DEVILISH DEAL BETTER THAN TOO MUCH SAID MR
 HAWLEY WHOSE BADLANGUAGE WAS NOTORIOUS IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTY
 SICK PEOPLE CANTBEAR SO MUCH PRAYING AND PREACHING
 AND THAT METHODISTICAL SORT OFRELIGION IS BAD FOR THE SPIRITSBAD FOR THE INSIDE EH
 HE ADDEDTURNING QUICKLY ROUND TO THE FOUR MEDICAL MEN WHO WERE ASSEMBLED
BUT ANY ANSWER WAS DISPENSED WITH BY THE ENTRANCE OF THREE GENTLEMENWITH WHOM THERE WERE GREETINGS MORE OR LESS CORDIAL
 THESE WERE THEREVEREND EDWARD THESIGER RECTOR OF ST
 PETERS MR
 BULSTRODE AND OURFRIEND MR
 BROOKE OF TIPTON WHO HAD LATELY ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE PUTON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN HIS TURN BUT HAD NEVER BEFORE ATTENDEDHIS ATTENDANCE NOW BEING DUE TO MR
 BULSTRODES EXERTIONS
 LYDGATE WASTHE ONLY PERSON STILL EXPECTED
EVERY ONE NOW SAT DOWN MR
 BULSTRODE PRESIDING PALE ANDSELFRESTRAINED AS USUAL
 MR
 THESIGER A MODERATE EVANGELICAL WISHEDFOR THE APPOINTMENT OF HIS FRIEND MR
 TYKE A ZEALOUS ABLE MAN WHOOFFICIATING AT A CHAPEL OF EASE HAD NOT A CURE OF SOULS TOO EXTENSIVETO LEAVE HIM AMPLE TIME FOR THE NEW DUTY
 IT WAS DESIRABLE THATCHAPLAINCIES OF THIS KIND SHOULD BE ENTERED ON WITH A FERVENTINTENTION THEY WERE PECULIAR OPPORTUNITIES FOR SPIRITUAL INFLUENCEAND WHILE IT WAS GOOD THAT A SALARY SHOULD BE ALLOTTED THERE WAS THEMORE NEED FOR SCRUPULOUS WATCHING LEST THE OFFICE SHOULD BE PERVERTEDINTO A MERE QUESTION OF SALARY
 MR
 THESIGERS MANNER HAD SO MUCH QUIETPROPRIETY THAT OBJECTORS COULD ONLY SIMMER IN SILENCE
MR
 BROOKE BELIEVED THAT EVERYBODY MEANT WELL IN THE MATTER
 HE HAD NOTHIMSELF ATTENDED TO THE AFFAIRS OF THE INFIRMARY THOUGH HE HAD ASTRONG INTEREST IN WHATEVER WAS FOR THE BENEFIT OF MIDDLEMARCH AND WASMOST HAPPY TO MEET THE GENTLEMEN PRESENT ON ANY PUBLIC QUESTIONANYPUBLIC QUESTION YOU KNOW MR
 BROOKE REPEATED WITH HIS NOD OFPERFECT UNDERSTANDING
 I AM A GOOD DEAL OCCUPIED AS A MAGISTRATE ANDIN THE COLLECTION OF DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE BUT I REGARD MY TIME ASBEING AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE PUBLICAND IN SHORT MY FRIENDS HAVECONVINCED ME THAT A CHAPLAIN WITH A SALARYA SALARY YOU KNOWIS A VERYGOOD THING AND I AM HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO COME HERE AND VOTE FOR THEAPPOINTMENT OF MR
 TYKE WHO I UNDERSTAND IS AN UNEXCEPTIONABLE MANAPOSTOLIC AND ELOQUENT AND EVERYTHING OF THAT KINDAND I AM THE LASTMAN TO WITHHOLD MY VOTEUNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU KNOW
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU HAVE BEEN CRAMMED WITH ONE SIDE OF THEQUESTION MR
 BROOKE SAID MR
 FRANK HAWLEY WHO WAS AFRAID OF NOBODYAND WAS A TORY SUSPICIOUS OF ELECTIONEERING INTENTIONS
 YOU DONT SEEMTO KNOW THAT ONE OF THE WORTHIEST MEN WE HAVE HAS BEEN DOING DUTY ASCHAPLAIN HERE FOR YEARS WITHOUT PAY AND THAT MR
 TYKE IS PROPOSED TOSUPERSEDE HIM
EXCUSE ME MR
 HAWLEY SAID MR
 BULSTRODE
 MR
 BROOKE HAS BEEN FULLYINFORMED OF MR
 FAREBROTHERS CHARACTER AND POSITION
BY HIS ENEMIES FLASHED OUT MR
 HAWLEY
I TRUST THERE IS NO PERSONAL HOSTILITY CONCERNED HERE SAID MR
THESIGER
ILL SWEAR THERE IS THOUGH RETORTED MR
 HAWLEY
GENTLEMEN SAID MR
 BULSTRODE IN A SUBDUED TONE THE MERITS OF THEQUESTION MAY BE VERY BRIEFLY STATED AND IF ANY ONE PRESENT DOUBTS THATEVERY GENTLEMAN WHO IS ABOUT TO GIVE HIS VOTE HAS NOT BEEN FULLYINFORMED I CAN NOW RECAPITULATE THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT SHOULD WEIGHON EITHER SIDE
I DONT SEE THE GOOD OF THAT SAID MR
 HAWLEY
 I SUPPOSE WE ALL KNOWWHOM WE MEAN TO VOTE FOR
 ANY MAN WHO WANTS TO DO JUSTICE DOES NOT WAITTILL THE LAST MINUTE TO HEAR BOTH SIDES OF THE QUESTION
 I HAVE NO TIMETO LOSE AND I PROPOSE THAT THE MATTER BE PUT TO THE VOTE AT ONCE
A BRIEF BUT STILL HOT DISCUSSION FOLLOWED BEFORE EACH PERSON WROTETYKE OR FAREBROTHER ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND SLIPPED IT INTO A GLASSTUMBLER AND IN THE MEAN TIME MR
 BULSTRODE SAW LYDGATE ENTER
I PERCEIVE THAT THE VOTES ARE EQUALLY DIVIDED AT PRESENT SAID MR
BULSTRODE IN A CLEAR BITING VOICE
 THEN LOOKING UP AT LYDGATETHERE IS A CASTINGVOTE STILL TO BE GIVEN
 IT IS YOURS MR
 LYDGATEWILL YOU BE GOOD ENOUGH TO WRITE
THE THING IS SETTLED NOW SAID MR
 WRENCH RISING
 WE ALL KNOW HOWMR
 LYDGATE WILL VOTE
YOU SEEM TO SPEAK WITH SOME PECULIAR MEANING SIR SAID LYDGATERATHER DEFIANTLY AND KEEPING HIS PENCIL SUSPENDED
I MERELY MEAN THAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO VOTE WITH MR
 BULSTRODE
 DO YOUREGARD THAT MEANING AS OFFENSIVE
IT MAY BE OFFENSIVE TO OTHERS
 BUT I SHALL NOT DESIST FROM VOTING WITHHIM ON THAT ACCOUNT
 LYDGATE IMMEDIATELY WROTE DOWN TYKE
SO THE REV
 WALTER TYKE BECAME CHAPLAIN TO THE INFIRMARY AND LYDGATECONTINUED TO WORK WITH MR
 BULSTRODE
 HE WAS REALLY UNCERTAIN WHETHERTYKE WERE NOT THE MORE SUITABLE CANDIDATE AND YET HIS CONSCIOUSNESSTOLD HIM THAT IF HE HAD BEEN QUITE FREE FROM INDIRECT BIAS HE SHOULDHAVE VOTED FOR MR
 FAREBROTHER
 THE AFFAIR OF THE CHAPLAINCY REMAINED ASORE POINT IN HIS MEMORY AS A CASE IN WHICH THIS PETTY MEDIUM OFMIDDLEMARCH HAD BEEN TOO STRONG FOR HIM
 HOW COULD A MAN BE SATISFIEDWITH A DECISION BETWEEN SUCH ALTERNATIVES AND UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
NO MORE THAN HE CAN BE SATISFIED WITH HIS HAT WHICH HE HAS CHOSEN FROMAMONG SUCH SHAPES AS THE RESOURCES OF THE AGE OFFER HIM WEARING IT ATBEST WITH A RESIGNATION WHICH IS CHIEFLY SUPPORTED BY COMPARISON
BUT MR
 FAREBROTHER MET HIM WITH THE SAME FRIENDLINESS AS BEFORE
 THECHARACTER OF THE PUBLICAN AND SINNER IS NOT ALWAYS PRACTICALLYINCOMPATIBLE WITH THAT OF THE MODERN PHARISEE FOR THE MAJORITY OF USSCARCELY SEE MORE DISTINCTLY THE FAULTINESS OF OUR OWN CONDUCT THAN THEFAULTINESS OF OUR OWN ARGUMENTS OR THE DULNESS OF OUR OWN JOKES
 BUTTHE VICAR OF ST
 BOTOLPHS HAD CERTAINLY ESCAPED THE SLIGHTEST TINCTUREOF THE PHARISEE AND BY DINT OF ADMITTING TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS TOOMUCH AS OTHER MEN WERE HE HAD BECOME REMARKABLY UNLIKE THEM INTHISTHAT HE COULD EXCUSE OTHERS FOR THINKING SLIGHTLY OF HIM ANDCOULD JUDGE IMPARTIALLY OF THEIR CONDUCT EVEN WHEN IT TOLD AGAINST HIM
THE WORLD HAS BEEN TOO STRONG FOR ME I KNOW HE SAID ONE DAY TOLYDGATE
 BUT THEN I AM NOT A MIGHTY MANI SHALL NEVER BE A MAN OFRENOWN
 THE CHOICE OF HERCULES IS A PRETTY FABLE BUT PRODICUS MAKES ITEASY WORK FOR THE HERO AS IF THE FIRST RESOLVES WERE ENOUGH
 ANOTHERSTORY SAYS THAT HE CAME TO HOLD THE DISTAFF AND AT LAST WORE THENESSUS SHIRT
 I SUPPOSE ONE GOOD RESOLVE MIGHT KEEP A MAN RIGHT IFEVERYBODY ELSES RESOLVE HELPED HIM
THE VICARS TALK WAS NOT ALWAYS INSPIRITING HE HAD ESCAPED BEING APHARISEE BUT HE HAD NOT ESCAPED THAT LOW ESTIMATE OF POSSIBILITIESWHICH WE RATHER HASTILY ARRIVE AT AS AN INFERENCE FROM OUR OWN FAILURE
LYDGATE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS A PITIABLE INFIRMITY OF WILL IN MR
FAREBROTHER

WHEN GEORGE THE FOURTH WAS STILL REIGNING OVER THE PRIVACIES OFWINDSOR WHEN THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON WAS PRIME MINISTER AND MR
 VINCYWAS MAYOR OF THE OLD CORPORATION IN MIDDLEMARCH MRS
 CASAUBON BORNDOROTHEA BROOKE HAD TAKEN HER WEDDING JOURNEY TO ROME
 IN THOSE DAYSTHE WORLD IN GENERAL WAS MORE IGNORANT OF GOOD AND EVIL BY FORTY YEARSTHAN IT IS AT PRESENT
 TRAVELLERS DID NOT OFTEN CARRY FULL INFORMATIONON CHRISTIAN ART EITHER IN THEIR HEADS OR THEIR POCKETS AND EVEN THEMOST BRILLIANT ENGLISH CRITIC OF THE DAY MISTOOK THE FLOWERFLUSHEDTOMB OF THE ASCENDED VIRGIN FOR AN ORNAMENTAL VASE DUE TO THE PAINTERSFANCY
 ROMANTICISM WHICH HAS HELPED TO FILL SOME DULL BLANKS WITH LOVEAND KNOWLEDGE HAD NOT YET PENETRATED THE TIMES WITH ITS LEAVEN ANDENTERED INTO EVERYBODYS FOOD IT WAS FERMENTING STILL AS ADISTINGUISHABLE VIGOROUS ENTHUSIASM IN CERTAIN LONGHAIRED GERMANARTISTS AT ROME AND THE YOUTH OF OTHER NATIONS WHO WORKED OR IDLEDNEAR THEM WERE SOMETIMES CAUGHT IN THE SPREADING MOVEMENT
ONE FINE MORNING A YOUNG MAN WHOSE HAIR WAS NOT IMMODERATELY LONG BUTABUNDANT AND CURLY AND WHO WAS OTHERWISE ENGLISH IN HIS EQUIPMENT HADJUST TURNED HIS BACK ON THE BELVEDERE TORSO IN THE VATICAN AND WASLOOKING OUT ON THE MAGNIFICENT VIEW OF THE MOUNTAINS FROM THE ADJOININGROUND VESTIBULE
 HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY ABSORBED NOT TO NOTICE THEAPPROACH OF A DARKEYED ANIMATED GERMAN WHO CAME UP TO HIM AND PLACINGA HAND ON HIS SHOULDER SAID WITH A STRONG ACCENT COME HERE QUICK
ELSE SHE WILL HAVE CHANGED HER POSE
QUICKNESS WAS READY AT THE CALL AND THE TWO FIGURES PASSED LIGHTLYALONG BY THE MELEAGER TOWARDS THE HALL WHERE THE RECLINING ARIADNETHEN CALLED THE CLEOPATRA LIES IN THE MARBLE VOLUPTUOUSNESS OF HERBEAUTY THE DRAPERY FOLDING AROUND HER WITH A PETALLIKE EASE ANDTENDERNESS
 THEY WERE JUST IN TIME TO SEE ANOTHER FIGURE STANDINGAGAINST A PEDESTAL NEAR THE RECLINING MARBLE A BREATHING BLOOMINGGIRL WHOSE FORM NOT SHAMED BY THE ARIADNE WAS CLAD IN QUAKERISH GRAYDRAPERY HER LONG CLOAK FASTENED AT THE NECK WAS THROWN BACKWARD FROMHER ARMS AND ONE BEAUTIFUL UNGLOVED HAND PILLOWED HER CHEEK PUSHINGSOMEWHAT BACKWARD THE WHITE BEAVER BONNET WHICH MADE A SORT OF HALO TOHER FACE AROUND THE SIMPLY BRAIDED DARKBROWN HAIR
 SHE WAS NOT LOOKINGAT THE SCULPTURE PROBABLY NOT THINKING OF IT HER LARGE EYES WEREFIXED DREAMILY ON A STREAK OF SUNLIGHT WHICH FELL ACROSS THE FLOOR
 BUTSHE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE TWO STRANGERS WHO SUDDENLY PAUSED AS IF TOCONTEMPLATE THE CLEOPATRA AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT THEM IMMEDIATELYTURNED AWAY TO JOIN A MAIDSERVANT AND COURIER WHO WERE LOITERING ALONGTHE HALL AT A LITTLE DISTANCE OFF
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT FOR A FINE BIT OF ANTITHESIS
 SAID THEGERMAN SEARCHING IN HIS FRIENDS FACE FOR RESPONDING ADMIRATION BUTGOING ON VOLUBLY WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY OTHER ANSWER
 THERE LIESANTIQUE BEAUTY NOT CORPSELIKE EVEN IN DEATH BUT ARRESTED IN THECOMPLETE CONTENTMENT OF ITS SENSUOUS PERFECTION AND HERE STANDS BEAUTYIN ITS BREATHING LIFE WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF CHRISTIAN CENTURIES INITS BOSOM
 BUT SHE SHOULD BE DRESSED AS A NUN I THINK SHE LOOKS ALMOSTWHAT YOU CALL A QUAKER I WOULD DRESS HER AS A NUN IN MY PICTURE
HOWEVER SHE IS MARRIED I SAW HER WEDDINGRING ON THAT WONDERFUL LEFTHAND OTHERWISE I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE SALLOW GEISTLICHER WAS HERFATHER
 I SAW HIM PARTING FROM HER A GOOD WHILE AGO AND JUST NOW IFOUND HER IN THAT MAGNIFICENT POSE
 ONLY THINK
 HE IS PERHAPS RICH ANDWOULD LIKE TO HAVE HER PORTRAIT TAKEN
 AH
 IT IS NO USE LOOKING AFTERHERTHERE SHE GOES
 LET US FOLLOW HER HOME
NO NO SAID HIS COMPANION WITH A LITTLE FROWN
YOU ARE SINGULAR LADISLAW
 YOU LOOK STRUCK TOGETHER
 DO YOU KNOWHER
I KNOW THAT SHE IS MARRIED TO MY COUSIN SAID WILL LADISLAWSAUNTERING DOWN THE HALL WITH A PREOCCUPIED AIR WHILE HIS GERMANFRIEND KEPT AT HIS SIDE AND WATCHED HIM EAGERLY
WHAT
 THE GEISTLICHER
 HE LOOKS MORE LIKE AN UNCLEA MORE USEFULSORT OF RELATION
HE IS NOT MY UNCLE
 I TELL YOU HE IS MY SECOND COUSIN SAID LADISLAWWITH SOME IRRITATION
SCHÖN SCHÖN
 DONT BE SNAPPISH
 YOU ARE NOT ANGRY WITH ME FORTHINKING MRS
 SECONDCOUSIN THE MOST PERFECT YOUNG MADONNA I EVER SAW
ANGRY
 NONSENSE
 I HAVE ONLY SEEN HER ONCE BEFORE FOR A COUPLE OFMINUTES WHEN MY COUSIN INTRODUCED HER TO ME JUST BEFORE I LEFTENGLAND
 THEY WERE NOT MARRIED THEN
 I DIDNT KNOW THEY WERE COMING TOROME
BUT YOU WILL GO TO SEE THEM NOWYOU WILL FIND OUT WHAT THEY HAVE FORAN ADDRESSSINCE YOU KNOW THE NAME
 SHALL WE GO TO THE POST
 AND YOUCOULD SPEAK ABOUT THE PORTRAIT
CONFOUND YOU NAUMANN
 I DONT KNOW WHAT I SHALL DO
 I AM NOT SOBRAZEN AS YOU
BAH
 THAT IS BECAUSE YOU ARE DILETTANTISH AND AMATEURISH
 IF YOU WEREAN ARTIST YOU WOULD THINK OF MISTRESS SECONDCOUSIN AS ANTIQUE FORMANIMATED BY CHRISTIAN SENTIMENTA SORT OF CHRISTIAN ANTIGONESENSUOUSFORCE CONTROLLED BY SPIRITUAL PASSION
YES AND THAT YOUR PAINTING HER WAS THE CHIEF OUTCOME OF HEREXISTENCETHE DIVINITY PASSING INTO HIGHER COMPLETENESS AND ALL BUTEXHAUSTED IN THE ACT OF COVERING YOUR BIT OF CANVAS
 I AM AMATEURISH IFYOU LIKE I DO NOT THINK THAT ALL THE UNIVERSE IS STRAINING TOWARDSTHE OBSCURE SIGNIFICANCE OF YOUR PICTURES
BUT IT IS MY DEAR
SO FAR AS IT IS STRAINING THROUGH ME ADOLFNAUMANN THAT STANDS FIRM SAID THE GOODNATURED PAINTER PUTTING AHAND ON LADISLAWS SHOULDER AND NOT IN THE LEAST DISTURBED BY THEUNACCOUNTABLE TOUCH OF ILLHUMOR IN HIS TONE
 SEE NOW
 MY EXISTENCEPRESUPPOSES THE EXISTENCE OF THE WHOLE UNIVERSEDOES IT NOT
 AND MYFUNCTION IS TO PAINTAND AS A PAINTER I HAVE A CONCEPTION WHICH ISALTOGETHER GENIALISCH OF YOUR GREATAUNT OR SECOND GRANDMOTHER AS ASUBJECT FOR A PICTURE THEREFORE THE UNIVERSE IS STRAINING TOWARDSTHAT PICTURE THROUGH THAT PARTICULAR HOOK OR CLAW WHICH IT PUTS FORTHIN THE SHAPE OF MENOT TRUE
BUT HOW IF ANOTHER CLAW IN THE SHAPE OF ME IS STRAINING TO THWARTIT
THE CASE IS A LITTLE LESS SIMPLE THEN
NOT AT ALL THE RESULT OF THE STRUGGLE IS THE SAME THINGPICTURE OR NOPICTURELOGICALLY
WILL COULD NOT RESIST THIS IMPERTURBABLE TEMPER AND THE CLOUD IN HISFACE BROKE INTO SUNSHINY LAUGHTER
COME NOW MY FRIENDYOU WILL HELP
 SAID NAUMANN IN A HOPEFUL TONE
NO NONSENSE NAUMANN
 ENGLISH LADIES ARE NOT AT EVERYBODYS SERVICEAS MODELS
 AND YOU WANT TO EXPRESS TOO MUCH WITH YOUR PAINTING
 YOUWOULD ONLY HAVE MADE A BETTER OR WORSE PORTRAIT WITH A BACKGROUND WHICHEVERY CONNOISSEUR WOULD GIVE A DIFFERENT REASON FOR OR AGAINST
 ANDWHAT IS A PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN
 YOUR PAINTING AND PLASTIK ARE POOR STUFFAFTER ALL
 THEY PERTURB AND DULL CONCEPTIONS INSTEAD OF RAISING THEM
LANGUAGE IS A FINER MEDIUM
YES FOR THOSE WHO CANT PAINT SAID NAUMANN
 THERE YOU HAVE PERFECTRIGHT
 I DID NOT RECOMMEND YOU TO PAINT MY FRIEND
THE AMIABLE ARTIST CARRIED HIS STING BUT LADISLAW DID NOT CHOOSE TOAPPEAR STUNG
 HE WENT ON AS IF HE HAD NOT HEARD
LANGUAGE GIVES A FULLER IMAGE WHICH IS ALL THE BETTER FOR BEINGVAGUE
 AFTER ALL THE TRUE SEEING IS WITHIN AND PAINTING STARES AT YOUWITH AN INSISTENT IMPERFECTION
 I FEEL THAT ESPECIALLY ABOUTREPRESENTATIONS OF WOMEN
 AS IF A WOMAN WERE A MERE COLOREDSUPERFICIES
 YOU MUST WAIT FOR MOVEMENT AND TONE
 THERE IS A DIFFERENCEIN THEIR VERY BREATHING THEY CHANGE FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT
THIS WOMANWHOM YOU HAVE JUST SEEN FOR EXAMPLE HOW WOULD YOU PAINT HER VOICEPRAY
 BUT HER VOICE IS MUCH DIVINER THAN ANYTHING YOU HAVE SEEN OFHER
I SEE I SEE
 YOU ARE JEALOUS
 NO MAN MUST PRESUME TO THINK THAT HECAN PAINT YOUR IDEAL
 THIS IS SERIOUS MY FRIEND
 YOUR GREATAUNT
 DERNEFFE ALS ONKEL IN A TRAGIC SENSEUNGEHEUER
YOU AND I SHALL QUARREL NAUMANN IF YOU CALL THAT LADY MY AUNTAGAIN
HOW IS SHE TO BE CALLED THEN
MRS
 CASAUBON
GOOD
 SUPPOSE I GET ACQUAINTED WITH HER IN SPITE OF YOU AND FIND THATSHE VERY MUCH WISHES TO BE PAINTED
YES SUPPOSE
 SAID WILL LADISLAW IN A CONTEMPTUOUS UNDERTONEINTENDED TO DISMISS THE SUBJECT
 HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BEING IRRITATED BYRIDICULOUSLY SMALL CAUSES WHICH WERE HALF OF HIS OWN CREATION
 WHY WASHE MAKING ANY FUSS ABOUT MRS
 CASAUBON
 AND YET HE FELT AS IF SOMETHINGHAD HAPPENED TO HIM WITH REGARD TO HER
 THERE ARE CHARACTERS WHICH ARECONTINUALLY CREATING COLLISIONS AND NODES FOR THEMSELVES IN DRAMASWHICH NOBODY IS PREPARED TO ACT WITH THEM
 THEIR SUSCEPTIBILITIES WILLCLASH AGAINST OBJECTS THAT REMAIN INNOCENTLY QUIET
CHAPTER XX
A CHILD FORSAKEN WAKING SUDDENLYWHOSE GAZE AFEARD ON ALL THINGS ROUND DOTH ROVEAND SEETH ONLY THAT IT CANNOT SEE    THE MEETING EYES OF LOVE
TWO HOURS LATER DOROTHEA WAS SEATED IN AN INNER ROOM OR BOUDOIR OF AHANDSOME APARTMENT IN THE VIA SISTINA
I AM SORRY TO ADD THAT SHE WAS SOBBING BITTERLY WITH SUCH ABANDONMENTTO THIS RELIEF OF AN OPPRESSED HEART AS A WOMAN HABITUALLY CONTROLLEDBY PRIDE ON HER OWN ACCOUNT AND THOUGHTFULNESS FOR OTHERS WILLSOMETIMES ALLOW HERSELF WHEN SHE FEELS SECURELY ALONE
 AND MR
 CASAUBONWAS CERTAIN TO REMAIN AWAY FOR SOME TIME AT THE VATICAN
YET DOROTHEA HAD NO DISTINCTLY SHAPEN GRIEVANCE THAT SHE COULD STATEEVEN TO HERSELF AND IN THE MIDST OF HER CONFUSED THOUGHT AND PASSIONTHE MENTAL ACT THAT WAS STRUGGLING FORTH INTO CLEARNESS WAS ASELFACCUSING CRY THAT HER FEELING OF DESOLATION WAS THE FAULT OF HEROWN SPIRITUAL POVERTY
 SHE HAD MARRIED THE MAN OF HER CHOICE AND WITHTHE ADVANTAGE OVER MOST GIRLS THAT SHE HAD CONTEMPLATED HER MARRIAGECHIEFLY AS THE BEGINNING OF NEW DUTIES FROM THE VERY FIRST SHE HADTHOUGHT OF MR
 CASAUBON AS HAVING A MIND SO MUCH ABOVE HER OWN THAT HEMUST OFTEN BE CLAIMED BY STUDIES WHICH SHE COULD NOT ENTIRELY SHAREMOREOVER AFTER THE BRIEF NARROW EXPERIENCE OF HER GIRLHOOD SHE WASBEHOLDING ROME THE CITY OF VISIBLE HISTORY WHERE THE PAST OF A WHOLEHEMISPHERE SEEMS MOVING IN FUNERAL PROCESSION WITH STRANGE ANCESTRALIMAGES AND TROPHIES GATHERED FROM AFAR
BUT THIS STUPENDOUS FRAGMENTARINESS HEIGHTENED THE DREAMLIKESTRANGENESS OF HER BRIDAL LIFE
 DOROTHEA HAD NOW BEEN FIVE WEEKS INROME AND IN THE KINDLY MORNINGS WHEN AUTUMN AND WINTER SEEMED TO GOHAND IN HAND LIKE A HAPPY AGED COUPLE ONE OF WHOM WOULD PRESENTLYSURVIVE IN CHILLER LONELINESS SHE HAD DRIVEN ABOUT AT FIRST WITH MR
CASAUBON BUT OF LATE CHIEFLY WITH TANTRIPP AND THEIR EXPERIENCEDCOURIER
 SHE HAD BEEN LED THROUGH THE BEST GALLERIES HAD BEEN TAKEN TOTHE CHIEF POINTS OF VIEW HAD BEEN SHOWN THE GRANDEST RUINS AND THEMOST GLORIOUS CHURCHES AND SHE HAD ENDED BY OFTENEST CHOOSING TO DRIVEOUT TO THE CAMPAGNA WHERE SHE COULD FEEL ALONE WITH THE EARTH AND SKYAWAYFROM THE OPPRESSIVE MASQUERADE OF AGES IN WHICH HER OWN LIFE TOOSEEMED TO BECOME A MASQUE WITH ENIGMATICAL COSTUMES
TO THOSE WHO HAVE LOOKED AT ROME WITH THE QUICKENING POWER OF AKNOWLEDGE WHICH BREATHES A GROWING SOUL INTO ALL HISTORIC SHAPES ANDTRACES OUT THE SUPPRESSED TRANSITIONS WHICH UNITE ALL CONTRASTS ROMEMAY STILL BE THE SPIRITUAL CENTRE AND INTERPRETER OF THE WORLD
 BUT LETTHEM CONCEIVE ONE MORE HISTORICAL CONTRAST THE GIGANTIC BROKENREVELATIONS OF THAT IMPERIAL AND PAPAL CITY THRUST ABRUPTLY ON THENOTIONS OF A GIRL WHO HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN ENGLISH AND SWISSPURITANISM FED ON MEAGRE PROTESTANT HISTORIES AND ON ART CHIEFLY OFTHE HANDSCREEN SORT A GIRL WHOSE ARDENT NATURE TURNED ALL HER SMALLALLOWANCE OF KNOWLEDGE INTO PRINCIPLES FUSING HER ACTIONS INTO THEIRMOULD AND WHOSE QUICK EMOTIONS GAVE THE MOST ABSTRACT THINGS THEQUALITY OF A PLEASURE OR A PAIN A GIRL WHO HAD LATELY BECOME A WIFEAND FROM THE ENTHUSIASTIC ACCEPTANCE OF UNTRIED DUTY FOUND HERSELFPLUNGED IN TUMULTUOUS PREOCCUPATION WITH HER PERSONAL LOT
 THE WEIGHTOF UNINTELLIGIBLE ROME MIGHT LIE EASILY ON BRIGHT NYMPHS TO WHOM ITFORMED A BACKGROUND FOR THE BRILLIANT PICNIC OF ANGLOFOREIGN SOCIETYBUT DOROTHEA HAD NO SUCH DEFENCE AGAINST DEEP IMPRESSIONS
 RUINS ANDBASILICAS PALACES AND COLOSSI SET IN THE MIDST OF A SORDID PRESENTWHERE ALL THAT WAS LIVING AND WARMBLOODED SEEMED SUNK IN THE DEEPDEGENERACY OF A SUPERSTITION DIVORCED FROM REVERENCE THE DIMMER BUTYET EAGER TITANIC LIFE GAZING AND STRUGGLING ON WALLS AND CEILINGS THELONG VISTAS OF WHITE FORMS WHOSE MARBLE EYES SEEMED TO HOLD THEMONOTONOUS LIGHT OF AN ALIEN WORLD ALL THIS VAST WRECK OF AMBITIOUSIDEALS SENSUOUS AND SPIRITUAL MIXED CONFUSEDLY WITH THE SIGNS OFBREATHING FORGETFULNESS AND DEGRADATION AT FIRST JARRED HER AS WITH ANELECTRIC SHOCK AND THEN URGED THEMSELVES ON HER WITH THAT ACHEBELONGING TO A GLUT OF CONFUSED IDEAS WHICH CHECK THE FLOW OF EMOTION
FORMS BOTH PALE AND GLOWING TOOK POSSESSION OF HER YOUNG SENSE ANDFIXED THEMSELVES IN HER MEMORY EVEN WHEN SHE WAS NOT THINKING OF THEMPREPARING STRANGE ASSOCIATIONS WHICH REMAINED THROUGH HER AFTERYEARS
OUR MOODS ARE APT TO BRING WITH THEM IMAGES WHICH SUCCEED EACH OTHERLIKE THE MAGICLANTERN PICTURES OF A DOZE AND IN CERTAIN STATES OFDULL FORLORNNESS DOROTHEA ALL HER LIFE CONTINUED TO SEE THE VASTNESS OFST
 PETERS THE HUGE BRONZE CANOPY THE EXCITED INTENTION IN THEATTITUDES AND GARMENTS OF THE PROPHETS AND EVANGELISTS IN THE MOSAICSABOVE AND THE RED DRAPERY WHICH WAS BEING HUNG FOR CHRISTMAS SPREADINGITSELF EVERYWHERE LIKE A DISEASE OF THE RETINA
NOT THAT THIS INWARD AMAZEMENT OF DOROTHEAS WAS ANYTHING VERYEXCEPTIONAL MANY SOULS IN THEIR YOUNG NUDITY ARE TUMBLED OUT AMONGINCONGRUITIES AND LEFT TO FIND THEIR FEET AMONG THEM WHILE THEIRELDERS GO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS
 NOR CAN I SUPPOSE THAT WHEN MRS
CASAUBON IS DISCOVERED IN A FIT OF WEEPING SIX WEEKS AFTER HER WEDDINGTHE SITUATION WILL BE REGARDED AS TRAGIC
 SOME DISCOURAGEMENT SOMEFAINTNESS OF HEART AT THE NEW REAL FUTURE WHICH REPLACES THE IMAGINARYIS NOT UNUSUAL AND WE DO NOT EXPECT PEOPLE TO BE DEEPLY MOVED BY WHATIS NOT UNUSUAL
 THAT ELEMENT OF TRAGEDY WHICH LIES IN THE VERY FACT OFFREQUENCY HAS NOT YET WROUGHT ITSELF INTO THE COARSE EMOTION OFMANKIND AND PERHAPS OUR FRAMES COULD HARDLY BEAR MUCH OF IT
 IF WE HADA KEEN VISION AND FEELING OF ALL ORDINARY HUMAN LIFE IT WOULD BE LIKEHEARING THE GRASS GROW AND THE SQUIRRELS HEART BEAT AND WE SHOULD DIEOF THAT ROAR WHICH LIES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF SILENCE
 AS IT IS THEQUICKEST OF US WALK ABOUT WELL WADDED WITH STUPIDITY
HOWEVER DOROTHEA WAS CRYING AND IF SHE HAD BEEN REQUIRED TO STATE THECAUSE SHE COULD ONLY HAVE DONE SO IN SOME SUCH GENERAL WORDS AS I HAVEALREADY USED TO HAVE BEEN DRIVEN TO BE MORE PARTICULAR WOULD HAVE BEENLIKE TRYING TO GIVE A HISTORY OF THE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS FOR THAT NEWREAL FUTURE WHICH WAS REPLACING THE IMAGINARY DREW ITS MATERIAL FROMTHE ENDLESS MINUTIAE BY WHICH HER VIEW OF MR
 CASAUBON AND HER WIFELYRELATION NOW THAT SHE WAS MARRIED TO HIM WAS GRADUALLY CHANGING WITHTHE SECRET MOTION OF A WATCHHAND FROM WHAT IT HAD BEEN IN HER MAIDENDREAM
 IT WAS TOO EARLY YET FOR HER FULLY TO RECOGNIZE OR AT LEASTADMIT THE CHANGE STILL MORE FOR HER TO HAVE READJUSTED THATDEVOTEDNESS WHICH WAS SO NECESSARY A PART OF HER MENTAL LIFE THAT SHEWAS ALMOST SURE SOONER OR LATER TO RECOVER IT
 PERMANENT REBELLION THEDISORDER OF A LIFE WITHOUT SOME LOVING REVERENT RESOLVE WAS NOTPOSSIBLE TO HER BUT SHE WAS NOW IN AN INTERVAL WHEN THE VERY FORCE OFHER NATURE HEIGHTENED ITS CONFUSION
 IN THIS WAY THE EARLY MONTHS OFMARRIAGE OFTEN ARE TIMES OF CRITICAL TUMULTWHETHER THAT OF ASHRIMPPOOL OR OF DEEPER WATERSWHICH AFTERWARDS SUBSIDES INTO CHEERFULPEACE
BUT WAS NOT MR
 CASAUBON JUST AS LEARNED AS BEFORE
 HAD HIS FORMS OFEXPRESSION CHANGED OR HIS SENTIMENTS BECOME LESS LAUDABLE
 OHWAYWARDNESS OF WOMANHOOD
 DID HIS CHRONOLOGY FAIL HIM OR HIS ABILITYTO STATE NOT ONLY A THEORY BUT THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO HELD IT OR HISPROVISION FOR GIVING THE HEADS OF ANY SUBJECT ON DEMAND
 AND WAS NOTROME THE PLACE IN ALL THE WORLD TO GIVE FREE PLAY TO SUCHACCOMPLISHMENTS
 BESIDES HAD NOT DOROTHEAS ENTHUSIASM ESPECIALLYDWELT ON THE PROSPECT OF RELIEVING THE WEIGHT AND PERHAPS THE SADNESSWITH WHICH GREAT TASKS LIE ON HIM WHO HAS TO ACHIEVE THEM
 AND THATSUCH WEIGHT PRESSED ON MR
 CASAUBON WAS ONLY PLAINER THAN BEFORE
ALL THESE ARE CRUSHING QUESTIONS BUT WHATEVER ELSE REMAINED THE SAMETHE LIGHT HAD CHANGED AND YOU CANNOT FIND THE PEARLY DAWN AT NOONDAY
THE FACT IS UNALTERABLE THAT A FELLOWMORTAL WITH WHOSE NATURE YOU AREACQUAINTED SOLELY THROUGH THE BRIEF ENTRANCES AND EXITS OF A FEWIMAGINATIVE WEEKS CALLED COURTSHIP MAY WHEN SEEN IN THE CONTINUITY OFMARRIED COMPANIONSHIP BE DISCLOSED AS SOMETHING BETTER OR WORSE THANWHAT YOU HAVE PRECONCEIVED BUT WILL CERTAINLY NOT APPEAR ALTOGETHERTHE SAME
 AND IT WOULD BE ASTONISHING TO FIND HOW SOON THE CHANGE ISFELT IF WE HAD NO KINDRED CHANGES TO COMPARE WITH IT
 TO SHARE LODGINGSWITH A BRILLIANT DINNERCOMPANION OR TO SEE YOUR FAVORITE POLITICIANIN THE MINISTRY MAY BRING ABOUT CHANGES QUITE AS RAPID IN THESE CASESTOO WE BEGIN BY KNOWING LITTLE AND BELIEVING MUCH AND WE SOMETIMES ENDBY INVERTING THE QUANTITIES
STILL SUCH COMPARISONS MIGHT MISLEAD FOR NO MAN WAS MORE INCAPABLE OFFLASHY MAKEBELIEVE THAN MR
 CASAUBON HE WAS AS GENUINE A CHARACTER ASANY RUMINANT ANIMAL AND HE HAD NOT ACTIVELY ASSISTED IN CREATING ANYILLUSIONS ABOUT HIMSELF
 HOW WAS IT THAT IN THE WEEKS SINCE HERMARRIAGE DOROTHEA HAD NOT DISTINCTLY OBSERVED BUT FELT WITH A STIFLINGDEPRESSION THAT THE LARGE VISTAS AND WIDE FRESH AIR WHICH SHE HADDREAMED OF FINDING IN HER HUSBANDS MIND WERE REPLACED BY ANTEROOMS ANDWINDING PASSAGES WHICH SEEMED TO LEAD NOWHITHER
 I SUPPOSE IT WAS THATIN COURTSHIP EVERYTHING IS REGARDED AS PROVISIONAL AND PRELIMINARY ANDTHE SMALLEST SAMPLE OF VIRTUE OR ACCOMPLISHMENT IS TAKEN TO GUARANTEEDELIGHTFUL STORES WHICH THE BROAD LEISURE OF MARRIAGE WILL REVEAL
 BUTTHE DOORSILL OF MARRIAGE ONCE CROSSED EXPECTATION IS CONCENTRATED ONTHE PRESENT
 HAVING ONCE EMBARKED ON YOUR MARITAL VOYAGE IT ISIMPOSSIBLE NOT TO BE AWARE THAT YOU MAKE NO WAY AND THAT THE SEA IS NOTWITHIN SIGHTTHAT IN FACT YOU ARE EXPLORING AN ENCLOSED BASIN
IN THEIR CONVERSATION BEFORE MARRIAGE MR
 CASAUBON HAD OFTEN DWELT ONSOME EXPLANATION OR QUESTIONABLE DETAIL OF WHICH DOROTHEA DID NOT SEETHE BEARING BUT SUCH IMPERFECT COHERENCE SEEMED DUE TO THE BROKENNESSOF THEIR INTERCOURSE AND SUPPORTED BY HER FAITH IN THEIR FUTURE SHEHAD LISTENED WITH FERVID PATIENCE TO A RECITATION OF POSSIBLE ARGUMENTSTO BE BROUGHT AGAINST MR
 CASAUBONS ENTIRELY NEW VIEW OF THEPHILISTINE GOD DAGON AND OTHER FISHDEITIES THINKING THAT HEREAFTERSHE SHOULD SEE THIS SUBJECT WHICH TOUCHED HIM SO NEARLY FROM THE SAMEHIGH GROUND WHENCE DOUBTLESS IT HAD BECOME SO IMPORTANT TO HIM
 AGAINTHE MATTEROFCOURSE STATEMENT AND TONE OF DISMISSAL WITH WHICH HETREATED WHAT TO HER WERE THE MOST STIRRING THOUGHTS WAS EASILYACCOUNTED FOR AS BELONGING TO THE SENSE OF HASTE AND PREOCCUPATION INWHICH SHE HERSELF SHARED DURING THEIR ENGAGEMENT
 BUT NOW SINCE THEYHAD BEEN IN ROME WITH ALL THE DEPTHS OF HER EMOTION ROUSED TOTUMULTUOUS ACTIVITY AND WITH LIFE MADE A NEW PROBLEM BY NEW ELEMENTSSHE HAD BEEN BECOMING MORE AND MORE AWARE WITH A CERTAIN TERROR THATHER MIND WAS CONTINUALLY SLIDING INTO INWARD FITS OF ANGER ANDREPULSION OR ELSE INTO FORLORN WEARINESS
 HOW FAR THE JUDICIOUS HOOKEROR ANY OTHER HERO OF ERUDITION WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME AT MR
CASAUBONS TIME OF LIFE SHE HAD NO MEANS OF KNOWING SO THAT HE COULDNOT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF COMPARISON BUT HER HUSBANDS WAY OFCOMMENTING ON THE STRANGELY IMPRESSIVE OBJECTS AROUND THEM HAD BEGUN TOAFFECT HER WITH A SORT OF MENTAL SHIVER HE HAD PERHAPS THE BESTINTENTION OF ACQUITTING HIMSELF WORTHILY BUT ONLY OF ACQUITTINGHIMSELF
 WHAT WAS FRESH TO HER MIND WAS WORN OUT TO HIS AND SUCHCAPACITY OF THOUGHT AND FEELING AS HAD EVER BEEN STIMULATED IN HIM BYTHE GENERAL LIFE OF MANKIND HAD LONG SHRUNK TO A SORT OF DRIEDPREPARATION A LIFELESS EMBALMMENT OF KNOWLEDGE
WHEN HE SAID DOES THIS INTEREST YOU DOROTHEA
 SHALL WE STAY A LITTLELONGER
 I AM READY TO STAY IF YOU WISH ITIT SEEMED TO HER AS IFGOING OR STAYING WERE ALIKE DREARY
 OR SHOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO THEFARNESINA DOROTHEA
 IT CONTAINS CELEBRATED FRESCOS DESIGNED OR PAINTEDBY RAPHAEL WHICH MOST PERSONS THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO VISIT
BUT DO YOU CARE ABOUT THEM
 WAS ALWAYS DOROTHEAS QUESTION
THEY ARE I BELIEVE HIGHLY ESTEEMED
 SOME OF THEM REPRESENT THE FABLEOF CUPID AND PSYCHE WHICH IS PROBABLY THE ROMANTIC INVENTION OF ALITERARY PERIOD AND CANNOT I THINK BE RECKONED AS A GENUINE MYTHICALPRODUCT
 BUT IF YOU LIKE THESE WALLPAINTINGS WE CAN EASILY DRIVETHITHER AND YOU WILL THEN I THINK HAVE SEEN THE CHIEF WORKS OFRAPHAEL ANY OF WHICH IT WERE A PITY TO OMIT IN A VISIT TO ROME
 HE ISTHE PAINTER WHO HAS BEEN HELD TO COMBINE THE MOST COMPLETE GRACE OFFORM WITH SUBLIMITY OF EXPRESSION
 SUCH AT LEAST I HAVE GATHERED TO BETHE OPINION OF COGNOSCENTI
THIS KIND OF ANSWER GIVEN IN A MEASURED OFFICIAL TONE AS OF ACLERGYMAN READING ACCORDING TO THE RUBRIC DID NOT HELP TO JUSTIFY THEGLORIES OF THE ETERNAL CITY OR TO GIVE HER THE HOPE THAT IF SHE KNEWMORE ABOUT THEM THE WORLD WOULD BE JOYOUSLY ILLUMINATED FOR HER
 THEREIS HARDLY ANY CONTACT MORE DEPRESSING TO A YOUNG ARDENT CREATURE THANTHAT OF A MIND IN WHICH YEARS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE SEEM TO HAVE ISSUED INA BLANK ABSENCE OF INTEREST OR SYMPATHY
ON OTHER SUBJECTS INDEED MR
 CASAUBON SHOWED A TENACITY OF OCCUPATIONAND AN EAGERNESS WHICH ARE USUALLY REGARDED AS THE EFFECT OFENTHUSIASM AND DOROTHEA WAS ANXIOUS TO FOLLOW THIS SPONTANEOUSDIRECTION OF HIS THOUGHTS INSTEAD OF BEING MADE TO FEEL THAT SHEDRAGGED HIM AWAY FROM IT
 BUT SHE WAS GRADUALLY CEASING TO EXPECT WITHHER FORMER DELIGHTFUL CONFIDENCE THAT SHE SHOULD SEE ANY WIDE OPENINGWHERE SHE FOLLOWED HIM
 POOR MR
 CASAUBON HIMSELF WAS LOST AMONG SMALLCLOSETS AND WINDING STAIRS AND IN AN AGITATED DIMNESS ABOUT THECABEIRI OR IN AN EXPOSURE OF OTHER MYTHOLOGISTS ILLCONSIDEREDPARALLELS EASILY LOST SIGHT OF ANY PURPOSE WHICH HAD PROMPTED HIM TOTHESE LABORS
 WITH HIS TAPER STUCK BEFORE HIM HE FORGOT THE ABSENCE OFWINDOWS AND IN BITTER MANUSCRIPT REMARKS ON OTHER MENS NOTIONS ABOUTTHE SOLAR DEITIES HE HAD BECOME INDIFFERENT TO THE SUNLIGHT
THESE CHARACTERISTICS FIXED AND UNCHANGEABLE AS BONE IN MR
 CASAUBONMIGHT HAVE REMAINED LONGER UNFELT BY DOROTHEA IF SHE HAD BEENENCOURAGED TO POUR FORTH HER GIRLISH AND WOMANLY FEELINGIF HE WOULDHAVE HELD HER HANDS BETWEEN HIS AND LISTENED WITH THE DELIGHT OFTENDERNESS AND UNDERSTANDING TO ALL THE LITTLE HISTORIES WHICH MADE UPHER EXPERIENCE AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN HER THE SAME SORT OF INTIMACY INRETURN SO THAT THE PAST LIFE OF EACH COULD BE INCLUDED IN THEIR MUTUALKNOWLEDGE AND AFFECTIONOR IF SHE COULD HAVE FED HER AFFECTION WITHTHOSE CHILDLIKE CARESSES WHICH ARE THE BENT OF EVERY SWEET WOMAN WHOHAS BEGUN BY SHOWERING KISSES ON THE HARD PATE OF HER BALD DOLLCREATING A HAPPY SOUL WITHIN THAT WOODENNESS FROM THE WEALTH OF HER OWNLOVE
 THAT WAS DOROTHEAS BENT
 WITH ALL HER YEARNING TO KNOW WHAT WASAFAR FROM HER AND TO BE WIDELY BENIGNANT SHE HAD ARDOR ENOUGH FOR WHATWAS NEAR TO HAVE KISSED MR
 CASAUBONS COATSLEEVE OR TO HAVECARESSED HIS SHOELATCHET IF HE WOULD HAVE MADE ANY OTHER SIGN OFACCEPTANCE THAN PRONOUNCING HER WITH HIS UNFAILING PROPRIETY TO BE OFA MOST AFFECTIONATE AND TRULY FEMININE NATURE INDICATING AT THE SAMETIME BY POLITELY REACHING A CHAIR FOR HER THAT HE REGARDED THESEMANIFESTATIONS AS RATHER CRUDE AND STARTLING
 HAVING MADE HIS CLERICALTOILET WITH DUE CARE IN THE MORNING HE WAS PREPARED ONLY FOR THOSEAMENITIES OF LIFE WHICH WERE SUITED TO THE WELLADJUSTED STIFF CRAVATOF THE PERIOD AND TO A MIND WEIGHTED WITH UNPUBLISHED MATTER
AND BY A SAD CONTRADICTION DOROTHEAS IDEAS AND RESOLVES SEEMED LIKEMELTING ICE FLOATING AND LOST IN THE WARM FLOOD OF WHICH THEY HAD BEENBUT ANOTHER FORM
 SHE WAS HUMILIATED TO FIND HERSELF A MERE VICTIM OFFEELING AS IF SHE COULD KNOW NOTHING EXCEPT THROUGH THAT MEDIUM ALLHER STRENGTH WAS SCATTERED IN FITS OF AGITATION OF STRUGGLE OFDESPONDENCY AND THEN AGAIN IN VISIONS OF MORE COMPLETE RENUNCIATIONTRANSFORMING ALL HARD CONDITIONS INTO DUTY
 POOR DOROTHEA
 SHE WASCERTAINLY TROUBLESOMETO HERSELF CHIEFLY BUT THIS MORNING FOR THEFIRST TIME SHE HAD BEEN TROUBLESOME TO MR
 CASAUBON
SHE HAD BEGUN WHILE THEY WERE TAKING COFFEE WITH A DETERMINATION TOSHAKE OFF WHAT SHE INWARDLY CALLED HER SELFISHNESS AND TURNED A FACEALL CHEERFUL ATTENTION TO HER HUSBAND WHEN HE SAID MY DEAR DOROTHEAWE MUST NOW THINK OF ALL THAT IS YET LEFT UNDONE AS A PRELIMINARY TOOUR DEPARTURE
 I WOULD FAIN HAVE RETURNED HOME EARLIER THAT WE MIGHTHAVE BEEN AT LOWICK FOR THE CHRISTMAS BUT MY INQUIRIES HERE HAVE BEENPROTRACTED BEYOND THEIR ANTICIPATED PERIOD
 I TRUST HOWEVER THAT THETIME HERE HAS NOT BEEN PASSED UNPLEASANTLY TO YOU
 AMONG THE SIGHTS OFEUROPE THAT OF ROME HAS EVER BEEN HELD ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING AND INSOME RESPECTS EDIFYING
 I WELL REMEMBER THAT I CONSIDERED IT AN EPOCHIN MY LIFE WHEN I VISITED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER THE FALL OFNAPOLEON AN EVENT WHICH OPENED THE CONTINENT TO TRAVELLERS
 INDEED ITHINK IT IS ONE AMONG SEVERAL CITIES TO WHICH AN EXTREME HYPERBOLE HASBEEN APPLIEDSEE ROME AND DIE BUT IN YOUR CASE I WOULD PROPOSE ANEMENDATION AND SAY SEE ROME AS A BRIDE AND LIVE HENCEFORTH AS A HAPPYWIFE
MR
 CASAUBON PRONOUNCED THIS LITTLE SPEECH WITH THE MOST CONSCIENTIOUSINTENTION BLINKING A LITTLE AND SWAYING HIS HEAD UP AND DOWN ANDCONCLUDING WITH A SMILE
 HE HAD NOT FOUND MARRIAGE A RAPTUROUS STATEBUT HE HAD NO IDEA OF BEING ANYTHING ELSE THAN AN IRREPROACHABLEHUSBAND WHO WOULD MAKE A CHARMING YOUNG WOMAN AS HAPPY AS SHE DESERVEDTO BE
I HOPE YOU ARE THOROUGHLY SATISFIED WITH OUR STAYI MEAN WITH THERESULT SO FAR AS YOUR STUDIES ARE CONCERNED SAID DOROTHEA TRYING TOKEEP HER MIND FIXED ON WHAT MOST AFFECTED HER HUSBAND
YES SAID MR
 CASAUBON WITH THAT PECULIAR PITCH OF VOICE WHICH MAKESTHE WORD HALF A NEGATIVE
 I HAVE BEEN LED FARTHER THAN I HAD FORESEENAND VARIOUS SUBJECTS FOR ANNOTATION HAVE PRESENTED THEMSELVES WHICHTHOUGH I HAVE NO DIRECT NEED OF THEM I COULD NOT PRETERMIT
 THE TASKNOTWITHSTANDING THE ASSISTANCE OF MY AMANUENSIS HAS BEEN A SOMEWHATLABORIOUS ONE BUT YOUR SOCIETY HAS HAPPILY PREVENTED ME FROM THAT TOOCONTINUOUS PROSECUTION OF THOUGHT BEYOND THE HOURS OF STUDY WHICH HASBEEN THE SNARE OF MY SOLITARY LIFE
I AM VERY GLAD THAT MY PRESENCE HAS MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO YOU SAIDDOROTHEA WHO HAD A VIVID MEMORY OF EVENINGS IN WHICH SHE HAD SUPPOSEDTHAT MR
 CASAUBONS MIND HAD GONE TOO DEEP DURING THE DAY TO BE ABLE TOGET TO THE SURFACE AGAIN
 I FEAR THERE WAS A LITTLE TEMPER IN HERREPLY
 I HOPE WHEN WE GET TO LOWICK I SHALL BE MORE USEFUL TO YOUAND BE ABLE TO ENTER A LITTLE MORE INTO WHAT INTERESTS YOU
DOUBTLESS MY DEAR SAID MR
 CASAUBON WITH A SLIGHT BOW
 THE NOTESI HAVE HERE MADE WILL WANT SIFTING AND YOU CAN IF YOU PLEASE EXTRACTTHEM UNDER MY DIRECTION
AND ALL YOUR NOTES SAID DOROTHEA WHOSE HEART HAD ALREADY BURNEDWITHIN HER ON THIS SUBJECT SO THAT NOW SHE COULD NOT HELP SPEAKINGWITH HER TONGUE
 ALL THOSE ROWS OF VOLUMESWILL YOU NOT NOW DO WHATYOU USED TO SPEAK OF
WILL YOU NOT MAKE UP YOUR MIND WHAT PART OF THEMYOU WILL USE AND BEGIN TO WRITE THE BOOK WHICH WILL MAKE YOUR VASTKNOWLEDGE USEFUL TO THE WORLD
 I WILL WRITE TO YOUR DICTATION OR IWILL COPY AND EXTRACT WHAT YOU TELL ME I CAN BE OF NO OTHER USE
DOROTHEA IN A MOST UNACCOUNTABLE DARKLY FEMININE MANNER ENDED WITH ASLIGHT SOB AND EYES FULL OF TEARS
THE EXCESSIVE FEELING MANIFESTED WOULD ALONE HAVE BEEN HIGHLYDISTURBING TO MR
 CASAUBON BUT THERE WERE OTHER REASONS WHY DOROTHEASWORDS WERE AMONG THE MOST CUTTING AND IRRITATING TO HIM THAT SHE COULDHAVE BEEN IMPELLED TO USE
 SHE WAS AS BLIND TO HIS INWARD TROUBLES ASHE TO HERS SHE HAD NOT YET LEARNED THOSE HIDDEN CONFLICTS IN HERHUSBAND WHICH CLAIM OUR PITY
 SHE HAD NOT YET LISTENED PATIENTLY TO HISHEARTBEATS BUT ONLY FELT THAT HER OWN WAS BEATING VIOLENTLY
 IN MR
CASAUBONS EAR DOROTHEAS VOICE GAVE LOUD EMPHATIC ITERATION TO THOSEMUFFLED SUGGESTIONS OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH IT WAS POSSIBLE TO EXPLAINAS MERE FANCY THE ILLUSION OF EXAGGERATED SENSITIVENESS ALWAYS WHENSUCH SUGGESTIONS ARE UNMISTAKABLY REPEATED FROM WITHOUT THEY ARERESISTED AS CRUEL AND UNJUST
 WE ARE ANGERED EVEN BY THE FULLACCEPTANCE OF OUR HUMILIATING CONFESSIONSHOW MUCH MORE BY HEARING INHARD DISTINCT SYLLABLES FROM THE LIPS OF A NEAR OBSERVER THOSECONFUSED MURMURS WHICH WE TRY TO CALL MORBID AND STRIVE AGAINST AS IFTHEY WERE THE ONCOMING OF NUMBNESS
 AND THIS CRUEL OUTWARD ACCUSER WASTHERE IN THE SHAPE OF A WIFENAY OF A YOUNG BRIDE WHO INSTEAD OFOBSERVING HIS ABUNDANT PENSCRATCHES AND AMPLITUDE OF PAPER WITH THEUNCRITICAL AWE OF AN ELEGANTMINDED CANARYBIRD SEEMED TO PRESENTHERSELF AS A SPY WATCHING EVERYTHING WITH A MALIGN POWER OF INFERENCE
HERE TOWARDS THIS PARTICULAR POINT OF THE COMPASS MR
 CASAUBON HAD ASENSITIVENESS TO MATCH DOROTHEAS AND AN EQUAL QUICKNESS TO IMAGINEMORE THAN THE FACT
 HE HAD FORMERLY OBSERVED WITH APPROBATION HERCAPACITY FOR WORSHIPPING THE RIGHT OBJECT HE NOW FORESAW WITH SUDDENTERROR THAT THIS CAPACITY MIGHT BE REPLACED BY PRESUMPTION THISWORSHIP BY THE MOST EXASPERATING OF ALL CRITICISMTHAT WHICH SEESVAGUELY A GREAT MANY FINE ENDS AND HAS NOT THE LEAST NOTION WHAT ITCOSTS TO REACH THEM
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE DOROTHEA HAD KNOWN HIM MR
 CASAUBONS FACEHAD A QUICK ANGRY FLUSH UPON IT
MY LOVE HE SAID WITH IRRITATION REINED IN BY PROPRIETY YOU MAYRELY UPON ME FOR KNOWING THE TIMES AND THE SEASONS ADAPTED TO THEDIFFERENT STAGES OF A WORK WHICH IS NOT TO BE MEASURED BY THE FACILECONJECTURES OF IGNORANT ONLOOKERS
 IT HAD BEEN EASY FOR ME TO GAIN ATEMPORARY EFFECT BY A MIRAGE OF BASELESS OPINION BUT IT IS EVER THETRIAL OF THE SCRUPULOUS EXPLORER TO BE SALUTED WITH THE IMPATIENT SCORNOF CHATTERERS WHO ATTEMPT ONLY THE SMALLEST ACHIEVEMENTS BEING INDEEDEQUIPPED FOR NO OTHER
 AND IT WERE WELL IF ALL SUCH COULD BE ADMONISHEDTO DISCRIMINATE JUDGMENTS OF WHICH THE TRUE SUBJECTMATTER LIESENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR REACH FROM THOSE OF WHICH THE ELEMENTS MAY BECOMPASSED BY A NARROW AND SUPERFICIAL SURVEY
THIS SPEECH WAS DELIVERED WITH AN ENERGY AND READINESS QUITE UNUSUALWITH MR
 CASAUBON
 IT WAS NOT INDEED ENTIRELY AN IMPROVISATION BUT HADTAKEN SHAPE IN INWARD COLLOQUY AND RUSHED OUT LIKE THE ROUND GRAINSFROM A FRUIT WHEN SUDDEN HEAT CRACKS IT
 DOROTHEA WAS NOT ONLY HISWIFE SHE WAS A PERSONIFICATION OF THAT SHALLOW WORLD WHICH SURROUNDSTHE APPRECIATED OR DESPONDING AUTHOR
DOROTHEA WAS INDIGNANT IN HER TURN
 HAD SHE NOT BEEN REPRESSINGEVERYTHING IN HERSELF EXCEPT THE DESIRE TO ENTER INTO SOME FELLOWSHIPWITH HER HUSBANDS CHIEF INTERESTS
MY JUDGMENT WAS A VERY SUPERFICIAL ONESUCH AS I AM CAPABLE OFFORMING SHE ANSWERED WITH A PROMPT RESENTMENT THAT NEEDED NOREHEARSAL
 YOU SHOWED ME THE ROWS OF NOTEBOOKSYOU HAVE OFTEN SPOKENOF THEMYOU HAVE OFTEN SAID THAT THEY WANTED DIGESTING
 BUT I NEVERHEARD YOU SPEAK OF THE WRITING THAT IS TO BE PUBLISHED
 THOSE WERE VERYSIMPLE FACTS AND MY JUDGMENT WENT NO FARTHER
 I ONLY BEGGED YOU TO LETME BE OF SOME GOOD TO YOU
DOROTHEA ROSE TO LEAVE THE TABLE AND MR
 CASAUBON MADE NO REPLY TAKINGUP A LETTER WHICH LAY BESIDE HIM AS IF TO REPERUSE IT
 BOTH WERESHOCKED AT THEIR MUTUAL SITUATIONTHAT EACH SHOULD HAVE BETRAYED ANGERTOWARDS THE OTHER
 IF THEY HAD BEEN AT HOME SETTLED AT LOWICK INORDINARY LIFE AMONG THEIR NEIGHBORS THE CLASH WOULD HAVE BEEN LESSEMBARRASSING BUT ON A WEDDING JOURNEY THE EXPRESS OBJECT OF WHICH ISTO ISOLATE TWO PEOPLE ON THE GROUND THAT THEY ARE ALL THE WORLD TO EACHOTHER THE SENSE OF DISAGREEMENT IS TO SAY THE LEAST CONFOUNDING ANDSTULTIFYING
 TO HAVE CHANGED YOUR LONGITUDE EXTENSIVELY AND PLACEDYOURSELVES IN A MORAL SOLITUDE IN ORDER TO HAVE SMALL EXPLOSIONS TOFIND CONVERSATION DIFFICULT AND TO HAND A GLASS OF WATER WITHOUTLOOKING CAN HARDLY BE REGARDED AS SATISFACTORY FULFILMENT EVEN TO THETOUGHEST MINDS
 TO DOROTHEAS INEXPERIENCED SENSITIVENESS IT SEEMEDLIKE A CATASTROPHE CHANGING ALL PROSPECTS AND TO MR
 CASAUBON IT WASA NEW PAIN HE NEVER HAVING BEEN ON A WEDDING JOURNEY BEFORE OR FOUNDHIMSELF IN THAT CLOSE UNION WHICH WAS MORE OF A SUBJECTION THAN HE HADBEEN ABLE TO IMAGINE SINCE THIS CHARMING YOUNG BRIDE NOT ONLY OBLIGEDHIM TO MUCH CONSIDERATION ON HER BEHALF WHICH HE HAD SEDULOUSLYGIVEN BUT TURNED OUT TO BE CAPABLE OF AGITATING HIM CRUELLY JUSTWHERE HE MOST NEEDED SOOTHING
 INSTEAD OF GETTING A SOFT FENCE AGAINSTTHE COLD SHADOWY UNAPPLAUSIVE AUDIENCE OF HIS LIFE HAD HE ONLY GIVENIT A MORE SUBSTANTIAL PRESENCE
NEITHER OF THEM FELT IT POSSIBLE TO SPEAK AGAIN AT PRESENT
 TO HAVEREVERSED A PREVIOUS ARRANGEMENT AND DECLINED TO GO OUT WOULD HAVE BEENA SHOW OF PERSISTENT ANGER WHICH DOROTHEAS CONSCIENCE SHRANK FROMSEEING THAT SHE ALREADY BEGAN TO FEEL HERSELF GUILTY
 HOWEVER JUST HERINDIGNATION MIGHT BE HER IDEAL WAS NOT TO CLAIM JUSTICE BUT TO GIVETENDERNESS
 SO WHEN THE CARRIAGE CAME TO THE DOOR SHE DROVE WITH MR
CASAUBON TO THE VATICAN WALKED WITH HIM THROUGH THE STONY AVENUE OFINSCRIPTIONS AND WHEN SHE PARTED WITH HIM AT THE ENTRANCE TO THELIBRARY WENT ON THROUGH THE MUSEUM OUT OF MERE LISTLESSNESS AS TO WHATWAS AROUND HER
 SHE HAD NOT SPIRIT TO TURN ROUND AND SAY THAT SHE WOULDDRIVE ANYWHERE
 IT WAS WHEN MR
 CASAUBON WAS QUITTING HER THAT NAUMANNHAD FIRST SEEN HER AND HE HAD ENTERED THE LONG GALLERY OF SCULPTURE ATTHE SAME TIME WITH HER BUT HERE NAUMANN HAD TO AWAIT LADISLAW WITHWHOM HE WAS TO SETTLE A BET OF CHAMPAGNE ABOUT AN ENIGMATICALMEDIAEVALLOOKING FIGURE THERE
 AFTER THEY HAD EXAMINED THE FIGURE ANDHAD WALKED ON FINISHING THEIR DISPUTE THEY HAD PARTED LADISLAWLINGERING BEHIND WHILE NAUMANN HAD GONE INTO THE HALL OF STATUES WHEREHE AGAIN SAW DOROTHEA AND SAW HER IN THAT BROODING ABSTRACTION WHICHMADE HER POSE REMARKABLE
 SHE DID NOT REALLY SEE THE STREAK OF SUNLIGHTON THE FLOOR MORE THAN SHE SAW THE STATUES SHE WAS INWARDLY SEEING THELIGHT OF YEARS TO COME IN HER OWN HOME AND OVER THE ENGLISH FIELDS ANDELMS AND HEDGEBORDERED HIGHROADS AND FEELING THAT THE WAY IN WHICHTHEY MIGHT BE FILLED WITH JOYFUL DEVOTEDNESS WAS NOT SO CLEAR TO HER ASIT HAD BEEN
 BUT IN DOROTHEAS MIND THERE WAS A CURRENT INTO WHICH ALLTHOUGHT AND FEELING WERE APT SOONER OR LATER TO FLOWTHE REACHINGFORWARD OF THE WHOLE CONSCIOUSNESS TOWARDS THE FULLEST TRUTH THE LEASTPARTIAL GOOD
 THERE WAS CLEARLY SOMETHING BETTER THAN ANGER ANDDESPONDENCY
CHAPTER XXI
HIRE FACOUNDE EKE FULL WOMANLY AND PLAINNO CONTREFETED TERMES HAD SHETO SEMEN WISE
CHAUCER
IT WAS IN THAT WAY DOROTHEA CAME TO BE SOBBING AS SOON AS SHE WASSECURELY ALONE
 BUT SHE WAS PRESENTLY ROUSED BY A KNOCK AT THE DOORWHICH MADE HER HASTILY DRY HER EYES BEFORE SAYING COME IN
 TANTRIPPHAD BROUGHT A CARD AND SAID THAT THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN WAITING IN THELOBBY
 THE COURIER HAD TOLD HIM THAT ONLY MRS
 CASAUBON WAS AT HOMEBUT HE SAID HE WAS A RELATION OF MR
 CASAUBONS WOULD SHE SEE HIM
YES SAID DOROTHEA WITHOUT PAUSE SHOW HIM INTO THE SALON
 HERCHIEF IMPRESSIONS ABOUT YOUNG LADISLAW WERE THAT WHEN SHE HAD SEEN HIMAT LOWICK SHE HAD BEEN MADE AWARE OF MR
 CASAUBONS GENEROSITY TOWARDSHIM AND ALSO THAT SHE HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS OWN HESITATION ABOUTHIS CAREER
 SHE WAS ALIVE TO ANYTHING THAT GAVE HER AN OPPORTUNITY FORACTIVE SYMPATHY AND AT THIS MOMENT IT SEEMED AS IF THE VISIT HAD COMETO SHAKE HER OUT OF HER SELFABSORBED DISCONTENTTO REMIND HER OF HERHUSBANDS GOODNESS AND MAKE HER FEEL THAT SHE HAD NOW THE RIGHT TO BEHIS HELPMATE IN ALL KIND DEEDS
 SHE WAITED A MINUTE OR TWO BUT WHENSHE PASSED INTO THE NEXT ROOM THERE WERE JUST SIGNS ENOUGH THAT SHE HADBEEN CRYING TO MAKE HER OPEN FACE LOOK MORE YOUTHFUL AND APPEALING THANUSUAL
 SHE MET LADISLAW WITH THAT EXQUISITE SMILE OF GOODWILL WHICH ISUNMIXED WITH VANITY AND HELD OUT HER HAND TO HIM
 HE WAS THE ELDER BYSEVERAL YEARS BUT AT THAT MOMENT HE LOOKED MUCH THE YOUNGER FOR HISTRANSPARENT COMPLEXION FLUSHED SUDDENLY AND HE SPOKE WITH A SHYNESSEXTREMELY UNLIKE THE READY INDIFFERENCE OF HIS MANNER WITH HIS MALECOMPANION WHILE DOROTHEA BECAME ALL THE CALMER WITH A WONDERING DESIRETO PUT HIM AT EASE
I WAS NOT AWARE THAT YOU AND MR
 CASAUBON WERE IN ROME UNTIL THISMORNING WHEN I SAW YOU IN THE VATICAN MUSEUM HE SAID
 I KNEW YOU ATONCEBUTI MEAN THAT I CONCLUDED MR
 CASAUBONS ADDRESS WOULD BE FOUNDAT THE POSTE RESTANTE AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO PAY MY RESPECTS TO HIM ANDYOU AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE
PRAY SIT DOWN
 HE IS NOT HERE NOW BUT HE WILL BE GLAD TO HEAR OF YOUI AM SURE SAID DOROTHEA SEATING HERSELF UNTHINKINGLY BETWEEN THEFIRE AND THE LIGHT OF THE TALL WINDOW AND POINTING TO A CHAIROPPOSITE WITH THE QUIETUDE OF A BENIGNANT MATRON
 THE SIGNS OF GIRLISHSORROW IN HER FACE WERE ONLY THE MORE STRIKING
 MR
 CASAUBON IS MUCHENGAGED BUT YOU WILL LEAVE YOUR ADDRESSWILL YOU NOT
AND HE WILLWRITE TO YOU
YOU ARE VERY GOOD SAID LADISLAW BEGINNING TO LOSE HIS DIFFIDENCE INTHE INTEREST WITH WHICH HE WAS OBSERVING THE SIGNS OF WEEPING WHICH HADALTERED HER FACE
 MY ADDRESS IS ON MY CARD
 BUT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME IWILL CALL AGAIN TOMORROW AT AN HOUR WHEN MR
 CASAUBON IS LIKELY TO BEAT HOME
HE GOES TO READ IN THE LIBRARY OF THE VATICAN EVERY DAY AND YOU CANHARDLY SEE HIM EXCEPT BY AN APPOINTMENT
 ESPECIALLY NOW
 WE ARE ABOUTTO LEAVE ROME AND HE IS VERY BUSY
 HE IS USUALLY AWAY ALMOST FROMBREAKFAST TILL DINNER
 BUT I AM SURE HE WILL WISH YOU TO DINE WITH US
WILL LADISLAW WAS STRUCK MUTE FOR A FEW MOMENTS
 HE HAD NEVER BEEN FONDOF MR
 CASAUBON AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE SENSE OF OBLIGATIONWOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT HIM AS A BAT OF ERUDITION
 BUT THE IDEA OF THISDRIEDUP PEDANT THIS ELABORATOR OF SMALL EXPLANATIONS ABOUT ASIMPORTANT AS THE SURPLUS STOCK OF FALSE ANTIQUITIES KEPT IN A VENDORSBACK CHAMBER HAVING FIRST GOT THIS ADORABLE YOUNG CREATURE TO MARRYHIM AND THEN PASSING HIS HONEYMOON AWAY FROM HER GROPING AFTER HISMOULDY FUTILITIES WILL WAS GIVEN TO HYPERBOLETHIS SUDDEN PICTURESTIRRED HIM WITH A SORT OF COMIC DISGUST HE WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN THEIMPULSE TO LAUGH ALOUD AND THE EQUALLY UNSEASONABLE IMPULSE TO BURSTINTO SCORNFUL INVECTIVE
FOR AN INSTANT HE FELT THAT THE STRUGGLE WAS CAUSING A QUEER CONTORTIONOF HIS MOBILE FEATURES BUT WITH A GOOD EFFORT HE RESOLVED IT INTONOTHING MORE OFFENSIVE THAN A MERRY SMILE
DOROTHEA WONDERED BUT THE SMILE WAS IRRESISTIBLE AND SHONE BACK FROMHER FACE TOO
 WILL LADISLAWS SMILE WAS DELIGHTFUL UNLESS YOU WEREANGRY WITH HIM BEFOREHAND IT WAS A GUSH OF INWARD LIGHT ILLUMINATINGTHE TRANSPARENT SKIN AS WELL AS THE EYES AND PLAYING ABOUT EVERY CURVEAND LINE AS IF SOME ARIEL WERE TOUCHING THEM WITH A NEW CHARM ANDBANISHING FOREVER THE TRACES OF MOODINESS
 THE REFLECTION OF THAT SMILECOULD NOT BUT HAVE A LITTLE MERRIMENT IN IT TOO EVEN UNDER DARKEYELASHES STILL MOIST AS DOROTHEA SAID INQUIRINGLY SOMETHING AMUSESYOU
YES SAID WILL QUICK IN FINDING RESOURCES
 I AM THINKING OF THESORT OF FIGURE I CUT THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU WHEN YOU ANNIHILATED MYPOOR SKETCH WITH YOUR CRITICISM
MY CRITICISM
 SAID DOROTHEA WONDERING STILL MORE
 SURELY NOT
 IALWAYS FEEL PARTICULARLY IGNORANT ABOUT PAINTING
I SUSPECTED YOU OF KNOWING SO MUCH THAT YOU KNEW HOW TO SAY JUST WHATWAS MOST CUTTING
 YOU SAIDI DARE SAY YOU DONT REMEMBER IT AS IDOTHAT THE RELATION OF MY SKETCH TO NATURE WAS QUITE HIDDEN FROM YOU
AT LEAST YOU IMPLIED THAT
 WILL COULD LAUGH NOW AS WELL AS SMILE
THAT WAS REALLY MY IGNORANCE SAID DOROTHEA ADMIRING WILLSGOODHUMOR
 I MUST HAVE SAID SO ONLY BECAUSE I NEVER COULD SEE ANYBEAUTY IN THE PICTURES WHICH MY UNCLE TOLD ME ALL JUDGES THOUGHT VERYFINE
 AND I HAVE GONE ABOUT WITH JUST THE SAME IGNORANCE IN ROME
 THEREARE COMPARATIVELY FEW PAINTINGS THAT I CAN REALLY ENJOY
 AT FIRST WHENI ENTER A ROOM WHERE THE WALLS ARE COVERED WITH FRESCOS OR WITH RAREPICTURES I FEEL A KIND OF AWELIKE A CHILD PRESENT AT GREAT CEREMONIESWHERE THERE ARE GRAND ROBES AND PROCESSIONS I FEEL MYSELF IN THEPRESENCE OF SOME HIGHER LIFE THAN MY OWN
 BUT WHEN I BEGIN TO EXAMINETHE PICTURES ONE BY ONE THE LIFE GOES OUT OF THEM OR ELSE IS SOMETHINGVIOLENT AND STRANGE TO ME
 IT MUST BE MY OWN DULNESS
 I AM SEEING SOMUCH ALL AT ONCE AND NOT UNDERSTANDING HALF OF IT
 THAT ALWAYS MAKESONE FEEL STUPID
 IT IS PAINFUL TO BE TOLD THAT ANYTHING IS VERY FINEAND NOT BE ABLE TO FEEL THAT IT IS FINESOMETHING LIKE BEING BLINDWHILE PEOPLE TALK OF THE SKY
OH THERE IS A GREAT DEAL IN THE FEELING FOR ART WHICH MUST BEACQUIRED SAID WILL
 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOW TO DOUBT THE DIRECTNESS OFDOROTHEAS CONFESSION
 ART IS AN OLD LANGUAGE WITH A GREAT MANYARTIFICIAL AFFECTED STYLES AND SOMETIMES THE CHIEF PLEASURE ONE GETSOUT OF KNOWING THEM IS THE MERE SENSE OF KNOWING
 I ENJOY THE ART OFALL SORTS HERE IMMENSELY BUT I SUPPOSE IF I COULD PICK MY ENJOYMENT TOPIECES I SHOULD FIND IT MADE UP OF MANY DIFFERENT THREADS
 THERE ISSOMETHING IN DAUBING A LITTLE ONES SELF AND HAVING AN IDEA OF THEPROCESS
YOU MEAN PERHAPS TO BE A PAINTER
 SAID DOROTHEA WITH A NEW DIRECTIONOF INTEREST
 YOU MEAN TO MAKE PAINTING YOUR PROFESSION
 MR
 CASAUBONWILL LIKE TO HEAR THAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN A PROFESSION
NO OH NO SAID WILL WITH SOME COLDNESS
 I HAVE QUITE MADE UP MYMIND AGAINST IT
 IT IS TOO ONESIDED A LIFE
 I HAVE BEEN SEEING A GREATDEAL OF THE GERMAN ARTISTS HERE I TRAVELLED FROM FRANKFORT WITH ONE OFTHEM
 SOME ARE FINE EVEN BRILLIANT FELLOWSBUT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TOGET INTO THEIR WAY OF LOOKING AT THE WORLD ENTIRELY FROM THE STUDIOPOINT OF VIEW
THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND SAID DOROTHEA CORDIALLY
 AND IN ROME ITSEEMS AS IF THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS WHICH ARE MORE WANTED IN THEWORLD THAN PICTURES
 BUT IF YOU HAVE A GENIUS FOR PAINTING WOULD ITNOT BE RIGHT TO TAKE THAT AS A GUIDE
 PERHAPS YOU MIGHT DO BETTERTHINGS THAN THESEOR DIFFERENT SO THAT THERE MIGHT NOT BE SO MANYPICTURES ALMOST ALL ALIKE IN THE SAME PLACE
THERE WAS NO MISTAKING THIS SIMPLICITY AND WILL WAS WON BY IT INTOFRANKNESS
 A MAN MUST HAVE A VERY RARE GENIUS TO MAKE CHANGES OF THATSORT
 I AM AFRAID MINE WOULD NOT CARRY ME EVEN TO THE PITCH OF DOINGWELL WHAT HAS BEEN DONE ALREADY AT LEAST NOT SO WELL AS TO MAKE ITWORTH WHILE
 AND I SHOULD NEVER SUCCEED IN ANYTHING BY DINT OFDRUDGERY
 IF THINGS DONT COME EASILY TO ME I NEVER GET THEM
I HAVE HEARD MR
 CASAUBON SAY THAT HE REGRETS YOUR WANT OF PATIENCESAID DOROTHEA GENTLY
 SHE WAS RATHER SHOCKED AT THIS MODE OF TAKINGALL LIFE AS A HOLIDAY
YES I KNOW MR
 CASAUBONS OPINION
 HE AND I DIFFER
THE SLIGHT STREAK OF CONTEMPT IN THIS HASTY REPLY OFFENDED DOROTHEA
SHE WAS ALL THE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE ABOUT MR
 CASAUBON BECAUSE OF HERMORNINGS TROUBLE
CERTAINLY YOU DIFFER SHE SAID RATHER PROUDLY
 I DID NOT THINK OFCOMPARING YOU SUCH POWER OF PERSEVERING DEVOTED LABOR AS MR
CASAUBONS IS NOT COMMON
WILL SAW THAT SHE WAS OFFENDED BUT THIS ONLY GAVE AN ADDITIONALIMPULSE TO THE NEW IRRITATION OF HIS LATENT DISLIKE TOWARDS MR
CASAUBON
 IT WAS TOO INTOLERABLE THAT DOROTHEA SHOULD BE WORSHIPPINGTHIS HUSBAND SUCH WEAKNESS IN A WOMAN IS PLEASANT TO NO MAN BUT THEHUSBAND IN QUESTION
 MORTALS ARE EASILY TEMPTED TO PINCH THE LIFE OUTOF THEIR NEIGHBORS BUZZING GLORY AND THINK THAT SUCH KILLING IS NOMURDER
NO INDEED HE ANSWERED PROMPTLY
 AND THEREFORE IT IS A PITY THATIT SHOULD BE THROWN AWAY AS SO MUCH ENGLISH SCHOLARSHIP IS FOR WANTOF KNOWING WHAT IS BEING DONE BY THE REST OF THE WORLD
 IF MR
 CASAUBONREAD GERMAN HE WOULD SAVE HIMSELF A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU SAID DOROTHEA STARTLED AND ANXIOUS
I MERELY MEAN SAID WILL IN AN OFFHAND WAY THAT THE GERMANS HAVETAKEN THE LEAD IN HISTORICAL INQUIRIES AND THEY LAUGH AT RESULTS WHICHARE GOT BY GROPING ABOUT IN WOODS WITH A POCKETCOMPASS WHILE THEY HAVEMADE GOOD ROADS
 WHEN I WAS WITH MR
 CASAUBON I SAW THAT HE DEAFENEDHIMSELF IN THAT DIRECTION IT WAS ALMOST AGAINST HIS WILL THAT HE READA LATIN TREATISE WRITTEN BY A GERMAN
 I WAS VERY SORRY
WILL ONLY THOUGHT OF GIVING A GOOD PINCH THAT WOULD ANNIHILATE THATVAUNTED LABORIOUSNESS AND WAS UNABLE TO IMAGINE THE MODE IN WHICHDOROTHEA WOULD BE WOUNDED
 YOUNG MR
 LADISLAW WAS NOT AT ALL DEEPHIMSELF IN GERMAN WRITERS BUT VERY LITTLE ACHIEVEMENT IS REQUIRED INORDER TO PITY ANOTHER MANS SHORTCOMINGS
POOR DOROTHEA FELT A PANG AT THE THOUGHT THAT THE LABOR OF HERHUSBANDS LIFE MIGHT BE VOID WHICH LEFT HER NO ENERGY TO SPARE FOR THEQUESTION WHETHER THIS YOUNG RELATIVE WHO WAS SO MUCH OBLIGED TO HIMOUGHT NOT TO HAVE REPRESSED HIS OBSERVATION
 SHE DID NOT EVEN SPEAKBUT SAT LOOKING AT HER HANDS ABSORBED IN THE PITEOUSNESS OF THATTHOUGHT
WILL HOWEVER HAVING GIVEN THAT ANNIHILATING PINCH WAS RATHERASHAMED IMAGINING FROM DOROTHEAS SILENCE THAT HE HAD OFFENDED HERSTILL MORE AND HAVING ALSO A CONSCIENCE ABOUT PLUCKING THETAILFEATHERS FROM A BENEFACTOR
I REGRETTED IT ESPECIALLY HE RESUMED TAKING THE USUAL COURSE FROMDETRACTION TO INSINCERE EULOGY BECAUSE OF MY GRATITUDE AND RESPECTTOWARDS MY COUSIN
 IT WOULD NOT SIGNIFY SO MUCH IN A MAN WHOSE TALENTSAND CHARACTER WERE LESS DISTINGUISHED
DOROTHEA RAISED HER EYES BRIGHTER THAN USUAL WITH EXCITED FEELING ANDSAID IN HER SADDEST RECITATIVE HOW I WISH I HAD LEARNED GERMAN WHEN IWAS AT LAUSANNE
 THERE WERE PLENTY OF GERMAN TEACHERS
 BUT NOW I CAN BEOF NO USE
THERE WAS A NEW LIGHT BUT STILL A MYSTERIOUS LIGHT FOR WILL INDOROTHEAS LAST WORDS
 THE QUESTION HOW SHE HAD COME TO ACCEPT MR
CASAUBONWHICH HE HAD DISMISSED WHEN HE FIRST SAW HER BY SAYING THATSHE MUST BE DISAGREEABLE IN SPITE OF APPEARANCESWAS NOT NOW TO BEANSWERED ON ANY SUCH SHORT AND EASY METHOD
 WHATEVER ELSE SHE MIGHT BESHE WAS NOT DISAGREEABLE
 SHE WAS NOT COLDLY CLEVER AND INDIRECTLYSATIRICAL BUT ADORABLY SIMPLE AND FULL OF FEELING
 SHE WAS AN ANGELBEGUILED
 IT WOULD BE A UNIQUE DELIGHT TO WAIT AND WATCH FOR THEMELODIOUS FRAGMENTS IN WHICH HER HEART AND SOUL CAME FORTH SO DIRECTLYAND INGENUOUSLY
 THE AEOLIAN HARP AGAIN CAME INTO HIS MIND
SHE MUST HAVE MADE SOME ORIGINAL ROMANCE FOR HERSELF IN THIS MARRIAGE
AND IF MR
 CASAUBON HAD BEEN A DRAGON WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF TO HISLAIR WITH HIS TALONS SIMPLY AND WITHOUT LEGAL FORMS IT WOULD HAVE BEENAN UNAVOIDABLE FEAT OF HEROISM TO RELEASE HER AND FALL AT HER FEET
 BUTHE WAS SOMETHING MORE UNMANAGEABLE THAN A DRAGON HE WAS A BENEFACTORWITH COLLECTIVE SOCIETY AT HIS BACK AND HE WAS AT THAT MOMENT ENTERINGTHE ROOM IN ALL THE UNIMPEACHABLE CORRECTNESS OF HIS DEMEANOR WHILEDOROTHEA WAS LOOKING ANIMATED WITH A NEWLY ROUSED ALARM AND REGRET ANDWILL WAS LOOKING ANIMATED WITH HIS ADMIRING SPECULATION ABOUT HERFEELINGS
MR
 CASAUBON FELT A SURPRISE WHICH WAS QUITE UNMIXED WITH PLEASURE BUTHE DID NOT SWERVE FROM HIS USUAL POLITENESS OF GREETING WHEN WILL ROSEAND EXPLAINED HIS PRESENCE
 MR
 CASAUBON WAS LESS HAPPY THAN USUAL ANDTHIS PERHAPS MADE HIM LOOK ALL THE DIMMER AND MORE FADED ELSE THEEFFECT MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY THE CONTRAST OF HIS YOUNGCOUSINS APPEARANCE
 THE FIRST IMPRESSION ON SEEING WILL WAS ONE OFSUNNY BRIGHTNESS WHICH ADDED TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF HIS CHANGINGEXPRESSION
 SURELY HIS VERY FEATURES CHANGED THEIR FORM HIS JAWLOOKED SOMETIMES LARGE AND SOMETIMES SMALL AND THE LITTLE RIPPLE INHIS NOSE WAS A PREPARATION FOR METAMORPHOSIS
 WHEN HE TURNED HIS HEADQUICKLY HIS HAIR SEEMED TO SHAKE OUT LIGHT AND SOME PERSONS THOUGHTTHEY SAW DECIDED GENIUS IN THIS CORUSCATION
 MR
 CASAUBON ON THECONTRARY STOOD RAYLESS
AS DOROTHEAS EYES WERE TURNED ANXIOUSLY ON HER HUSBAND SHE WAS PERHAPSNOT INSENSIBLE TO THE CONTRAST BUT IT WAS ONLY MINGLED WITH OTHERCAUSES IN MAKING HER MORE CONSCIOUS OF THAT NEW ALARM ON HIS BEHALFWHICH WAS THE FIRST STIRRING OF A PITYING TENDERNESS FED BY THEREALITIES OF HIS LOT AND NOT BY HER OWN DREAMS
 YET IT WAS A SOURCE OFGREATER FREEDOM TO HER THAT WILL WAS THERE HIS YOUNG EQUALITY WASAGREEABLE AND ALSO PERHAPS HIS OPENNESS TO CONVICTION
 SHE FELT ANIMMENSE NEED OF SOME ONE TO SPEAK TO AND SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN ANYONE WHO SEEMED SO QUICK AND PLIABLE SO LIKELY TO UNDERSTANDEVERYTHING
MR
 CASAUBON GRAVELY HOPED THAT WILL WAS PASSING HIS TIME PROFITABLY ASWELL AS PLEASANTLY IN ROMEHAD THOUGHT HIS INTENTION WAS TO REMAIN INSOUTH GERMANYBUT BEGGED HIM TO COME AND DINE TOMORROW WHEN HE COULDCONVERSE MORE AT LARGE AT PRESENT HE WAS SOMEWHAT WEARY
 LADISLAWUNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTING THE INVITATION IMMEDIATELY TOOK HIS LEAVE
DOROTHEAS EYES FOLLOWED HER HUSBAND ANXIOUSLY WHILE HE SANK DOWNWEARILY AT THE END OF A SOFA AND RESTING HIS ELBOW SUPPORTED HIS HEADAND LOOKED ON THE FLOOR
 A LITTLE FLUSHED AND WITH BRIGHT EYES SHESEATED HERSELF BESIDE HIM AND SAIDFORGIVE ME FOR SPEAKING SO HASTILY TO YOU THIS MORNING
 I WAS WRONG
 IFEAR I HURT YOU AND MADE THE DAY MORE BURDENSOME
I AM GLAD THAT YOU FEEL THAT MY DEAR SAID MR
 CASAUBON
 HE SPOKEQUIETLY AND BOWED HIS HEAD A LITTLE BUT THERE WAS STILL AN UNEASYFEELING IN HIS EYES AS HE LOOKED AT HER
BUT YOU DO FORGIVE ME
 SAID DOROTHEA WITH A QUICK SOB
 IN HER NEEDFOR SOME MANIFESTATION OF FEELING SHE WAS READY TO EXAGGERATE HER OWNFAULT
 WOULD NOT LOVE SEE RETURNING PENITENCE AFAR OFF AND FALL ON ITSNECK AND KISS IT
MY DEAR DOROTHEAWHO WITH REPENTANCE IS NOT SATISFIED IS NOT OFHEAVEN NOR EARTHYOU DO NOT THINK ME WORTHY TO BE BANISHED BY THATSEVERE SENTENCE SAID MR
 CASAUBON EXERTING HIMSELF TO MAKE A STRONGSTATEMENT AND ALSO TO SMILE FAINTLY
DOROTHEA WAS SILENT BUT A TEAR WHICH HAD COME UP WITH THE SOB WOULDINSIST ON FALLING
YOU ARE EXCITED MY DEAR
 AND I ALSO AM FEELING SOME UNPLEASANTCONSEQUENCES OF TOO MUCH MENTAL DISTURBANCE SAID MR
 CASAUBON
 INFACT HE HAD IT IN HIS THOUGHT TO TELL HER THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO HAVERECEIVED YOUNG LADISLAW IN HIS ABSENCE BUT HE ABSTAINED PARTLY FROMTHE SENSE THAT IT WOULD BE UNGRACIOUS TO BRING A NEW COMPLAINT IN THEMOMENT OF HER PENITENT ACKNOWLEDGMENT PARTLY BECAUSE HE WANTED TOAVOID FURTHER AGITATION OF HIMSELF BY SPEECH AND PARTLY BECAUSE HE WASTOO PROUD TO BETRAY THAT JEALOUSY OF DISPOSITION WHICH WAS NOT SOEXHAUSTED ON HIS SCHOLARLY COMPEERS THAT THERE WAS NONE TO SPARE INOTHER DIRECTIONS
 THERE IS A SORT OF JEALOUSY WHICH NEEDS VERY LITTLEFIRE IT IS HARDLY A PASSION BUT A BLIGHT BRED IN THE CLOUDY DAMPDESPONDENCY OF UNEASY EGOISM
I THINK IT IS TIME FOR US TO DRESS HE ADDED LOOKING AT HIS WATCH
THEY BOTH ROSE AND THERE WAS NEVER ANY FURTHER ALLUSION BETWEEN THEMTO WHAT HAD PASSED ON THIS DAY
BUT DOROTHEA REMEMBERED IT TO THE LAST WITH THE VIVIDNESS WITH WHICH WEALL REMEMBER EPOCHS IN OUR EXPERIENCE WHEN SOME DEAR EXPECTATION DIESOR SOME NEW MOTIVE IS BORN
 TODAY SHE HAD BEGUN TO SEE THAT SHE HADBEEN UNDER A WILD ILLUSION IN EXPECTING A RESPONSE TO HER FEELING FROMMR
 CASAUBON AND SHE HAD FELT THE WAKING OF A PRESENTIMENT THAT THEREMIGHT BE A SAD CONSCIOUSNESS IN HIS LIFE WHICH MADE AS GREAT A NEED ONHIS SIDE AS ON HER OWN
WE ARE ALL OF US BORN IN MORAL STUPIDITY TAKING THE WORLD AS AN UDDERTO FEED OUR SUPREME SELVES DOROTHEA HAD EARLY BEGUN TO EMERGE FROMTHAT STUPIDITY BUT YET IT HAD BEEN EASIER TO HER TO IMAGINE HOW SHEWOULD DEVOTE HERSELF TO MR
 CASAUBON AND BECOME WISE AND STRONG IN HISSTRENGTH AND WISDOM THAN TO CONCEIVE WITH THAT DISTINCTNESS WHICH ISNO LONGER REFLECTION BUT FEELINGAN IDEA WROUGHT BACK TO THE DIRECTNESSOF SENSE LIKE THE SOLIDITY OF OBJECTSTHAT HE HAD AN EQUIVALENT CENTREOF SELF WHENCE THE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS MUST ALWAYS FALL WITH A CERTAINDIFFERENCE

ALFRED DE MUSSET
WILL LADISLAW WAS DELIGHTFULLY AGREEABLE AT DINNER THE NEXT DAY ANDGAVE NO OPPORTUNITY FOR MR
 CASAUBON TO SHOW DISAPPROBATION
 ON THECONTRARY IT SEEMED TO DOROTHEA THAT WILL HAD A HAPPIER WAY OF DRAWINGHER HUSBAND INTO CONVERSATION AND OF DEFERENTIALLY LISTENING TO HIMTHAN SHE HAD EVER OBSERVED IN ANY ONE BEFORE
 TO BE SURE THE LISTENERSABOUT TIPTON WERE NOT HIGHLY GIFTED
 WILL TALKED A GOOD DEAL HIMSELFBUT WHAT HE SAID WAS THROWN IN WITH SUCH RAPIDITY AND WITH SUCH ANUNIMPORTANT AIR OF SAYING SOMETHING BY THE WAY THAT IT SEEMED A GAYLITTLE CHIME AFTER THE GREAT BELL
 IF WILL WAS NOT ALWAYS PERFECT THISWAS CERTAINLY ONE OF HIS GOOD DAYS
 HE DESCRIBED TOUCHES OF INCIDENTAMONG THE POOR PEOPLE IN ROME ONLY TO BE SEEN BY ONE WHO COULD MOVEABOUT FREELY HE FOUND HIMSELF IN AGREEMENT WITH MR
 CASAUBON AS TO THEUNSOUND OPINIONS OF MIDDLETON CONCERNING THE RELATIONS OF JUDAISM ANDCATHOLICISM AND PASSED EASILY TO A HALFENTHUSIASTIC HALFPLAYFULPICTURE OF THE ENJOYMENT HE GOT OUT OF THE VERY MISCELLANEOUSNESS OFROME WHICH MADE THE MIND FLEXIBLE WITH CONSTANT COMPARISON AND SAVEDYOU FROM SEEING THE WORLDS AGES AS A SET OF BOXLIKE PARTITIONSWITHOUT VITAL CONNECTION
 MR
 CASAUBONS STUDIES WILL OBSERVED HADALWAYS BEEN OF TOO BROAD A KIND FOR THAT AND HE HAD PERHAPS NEVER FELTANY SUCH SUDDEN EFFECT BUT FOR HIMSELF HE CONFESSED THAT ROME HADGIVEN HIM QUITE A NEW SENSE OF HISTORY AS A WHOLE THE FRAGMENTSSTIMULATED HIS IMAGINATION AND MADE HIM CONSTRUCTIVE
 THENOCCASIONALLY BUT NOT TOO OFTEN HE APPEALED TO DOROTHEA AND DISCUSSEDWHAT SHE SAID AS IF HER SENTIMENT WERE AN ITEM TO BE CONSIDERED IN THEFINAL JUDGMENT EVEN OF THE MADONNA DI FOLIGNO OR THE LAOCOON
 A SENSEOF CONTRIBUTING TO FORM THE WORLDS OPINION MAKES CONVERSATIONPARTICULARLY CHEERFUL AND MR
 CASAUBON TOO WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS PRIDEIN HIS YOUNG WIFE WHO SPOKE BETTER THAN MOST WOMEN AS INDEED HE HADPERCEIVED IN CHOOSING HER
SINCE THINGS WERE GOING ON SO PLEASANTLY MR
 CASAUBONS STATEMENT THATHIS LABORS IN THE LIBRARY WOULD BE SUSPENDED FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS ANDTHAT AFTER A BRIEF RENEWAL HE SHOULD HAVE NO FURTHER REASON FOR STAYINGIN ROME ENCOURAGED WILL TO URGE THAT MRS
 CASAUBON SHOULD NOT GO AWAYWITHOUT SEEING A STUDIO OR TWO
 WOULD NOT MR
 CASAUBON TAKE HER
 THATSORT OF THING OUGHT NOT TO BE MISSED IT WAS QUITE SPECIAL IT WAS AFORM OF LIFE THAT GREW LIKE A SMALL FRESH VEGETATION WITH ITSPOPULATION OF INSECTS ON HUGE FOSSILS
 WILL WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONDUCTTHEMNOT TO ANYTHING WEARISOME ONLY TO A FEW EXAMPLES
MR
 CASAUBON SEEING DOROTHEA LOOK EARNESTLY TOWARDS HIM COULD NOT BUTASK HER IF SHE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SUCH VISITS HE WAS NOW AT HERSERVICE DURING THE WHOLE DAY AND IT WAS AGREED THAT WILL SHOULD COMEON THE MORROW AND DRIVE WITH THEM
WILL COULD NOT OMIT THORWALDSEN A LIVING CELEBRITY ABOUT WHOM EVEN MR
CASAUBON INQUIRED BUT BEFORE THE DAY WAS FAR ADVANCED HE LED THE WAYTO THE STUDIO OF HIS FRIEND ADOLF NAUMANN WHOM HE MENTIONED AS ONE OFTHE CHIEF RENOVATORS OF CHRISTIAN ART ONE OF THOSE WHO HAD NOT ONLYREVIVED BUT EXPANDED THAT GRAND CONCEPTION OF SUPREME EVENTS ASMYSTERIES AT WHICH THE SUCCESSIVE AGES WERE SPECTATORS AND IN RELATIONTO WHICH THE GREAT SOULS OF ALL PERIODS BECAME AS IT WERECONTEMPORARIES
 WILL ADDED THAT HE HAD MADE HIMSELF NAUMANNS PUPIL FORTHE NONCE
I HAVE BEEN MAKING SOME OILSKETCHES UNDER HIM SAID WILL
 I HATECOPYING
 I MUST PUT SOMETHING OF MY OWN IN
 NAUMANN HAS BEEN PAINTINGTHE SAINTS DRAWING THE CAR OF THE CHURCH AND I HAVE BEEN MAKING ASKETCH OF MARLOWES TAMBURLAINE DRIVING THE CONQUERED KINGS IN HISCHARIOT
 I AM NOT SO ECCLESIASTICAL AS NAUMANN AND I SOMETIMES TWITHIM WITH HIS EXCESS OF MEANING
 BUT THIS TIME I MEAN TO OUTDO HIM INBREADTH OF INTENTION
 I TAKE TAMBURLAINE IN HIS CHARIOT FOR THETREMENDOUS COURSE OF THE WORLDS PHYSICAL HISTORY LASHING ON THEHARNESSED DYNASTIES
 IN MY OPINION THAT IS A GOOD MYTHICALINTERPRETATION
 WILL HERE LOOKED AT MR
 CASAUBON WHO RECEIVED THISOFFHAND TREATMENT OF SYMBOLISM VERY UNEASILY AND BOWED WITH A NEUTRALAIR
THE SKETCH MUST BE VERY GRAND IF IT CONVEYS SO MUCH SAID DOROTHEA
I SHOULD NEED SOME EXPLANATION EVEN OF THE MEANING YOU GIVE
 DO YOUINTEND TAMBURLAINE TO REPRESENT EARTHQUAKES AND VOLCANOES
OH YES SAID WILL LAUGHING AND MIGRATIONS OF RACES AND CLEARINGSOF FORESTSAND AMERICA AND THE STEAMENGINE
 EVERYTHING YOU CANIMAGINE
WHAT A DIFFICULT KIND OF SHORTHAND
 SAID DOROTHEA SMILING TOWARDSHER HUSBAND
 IT WOULD REQUIRE ALL YOUR KNOWLEDGE TO BE ABLE TO READIT
MR
 CASAUBON BLINKED FURTIVELY AT WILL
 HE HAD A SUSPICION THAT HE WASBEING LAUGHED AT
 BUT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO INCLUDE DOROTHEA IN THESUSPICION
THEY FOUND NAUMANN PAINTING INDUSTRIOUSLY BUT NO MODEL WAS PRESENTHIS PICTURES WERE ADVANTAGEOUSLY ARRANGED AND HIS OWN PLAIN VIVACIOUSPERSON SET OFF BY A DOVECOLORED BLOUSE AND A MAROON VELVET CAP SOTHAT EVERYTHING WAS AS FORTUNATE AS IF HE HAD EXPECTED THE BEAUTIFULYOUNG ENGLISH LADY EXACTLY AT THAT TIME
THE PAINTER IN HIS CONFIDENT ENGLISH GAVE LITTLE DISSERTATIONS ON HISFINISHED AND UNFINISHED SUBJECTS SEEMING TO OBSERVE MR
 CASAUBON ASMUCH AS HE DID DOROTHEA
 WILL BURST IN HERE AND THERE WITH ARDENT WORDSOF PRAISE MARKING OUT PARTICULAR MERITS IN HIS FRIENDS WORK ANDDOROTHEA FELT THAT SHE WAS GETTING QUITE NEW NOTIONS AS TO THESIGNIFICANCE OF MADONNAS SEATED UNDER INEXPLICABLE CANOPIED THRONESWITH THE SIMPLE COUNTRY AS A BACKGROUND AND OF SAINTS WITHARCHITECTURAL MODELS IN THEIR HANDS OR KNIVES ACCIDENTALLY WEDGED INTHEIR SKULLS
 SOME THINGS WHICH HAD SEEMED MONSTROUS TO HER WEREGATHERING INTELLIGIBILITY AND EVEN A NATURAL MEANING BUT ALL THIS WASAPPARENTLY A BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE IN WHICH MR
 CASAUBON HAD NOTINTERESTED HIMSELF
I THINK I WOULD RATHER FEEL THAT PAINTING IS BEAUTIFUL THAN HAVE TOREAD IT AS AN ENIGMA BUT I SHOULD LEARN TO UNDERSTAND THESE PICTURESSOONER THAN YOURS WITH THE VERY WIDE MEANING SAID DOROTHEA SPEAKINGTO WILL
DONT SPEAK OF MY PAINTING BEFORE NAUMANN SAID WILL
 HE WILL TELLYOU IT IS ALL PFUSCHEREI WHICH IS HIS MOST OPPROBRIOUS WORD
IS THAT TRUE
 SAID DOROTHEA TURNING HER SINCERE EYES ON NAUMANN WHOMADE A SLIGHT GRIMACE AND SAIDOH HE DOES NOT MEAN IT SERIOUSLY WITH PAINTING
 HIS WALK MUST BEBELLESLETTRES
 THAT IS WIIDE
NAUMANNS PRONUNCIATION OF THE VOWEL SEEMED TO STRETCH THE WORDSATIRICALLY
 WILL DID NOT HALF LIKE IT BUT MANAGED TO LAUGH AND MR
CASAUBON WHILE HE FELT SOME DISGUST AT THE ARTISTS GERMAN ACCENTBEGAN TO ENTERTAIN A LITTLE RESPECT FOR HIS JUDICIOUS SEVERITY
THE RESPECT WAS NOT DIMINISHED WHEN NAUMANN AFTER DRAWING WILL ASIDEFOR A MOMENT AND LOOKING FIRST AT A LARGE CANVAS THEN AT MR
CASAUBON CAME FORWARD AGAIN AND SAIDMY FRIEND LADISLAW THINKS YOU WILL PARDON ME SIR IF I SAY THAT ASKETCH OF YOUR HEAD WOULD BE INVALUABLE TO ME FOR THE ST
 THOMASAQUINAS IN MY PICTURE THERE
 IT IS TOO MUCH TO ASK BUT I SO SELDOM SEEJUST WHAT I WANTTHE IDEALISTIC IN THE REAL
YOU ASTONISH ME GREATLY SIR SAID MR
 CASAUBON HIS LOOKS IMPROVEDWITH A GLOW OF DELIGHT BUT IF MY POOR PHYSIOGNOMY WHICH I HAVE BEENACCUSTOMED TO REGARD AS OF THE COMMONEST ORDER CAN BE OF ANY USE TOYOU IN FURNISHING SOME TRAITS FOR THE ANGELICAL DOCTOR I SHALL FEELHONORED
 THAT IS TO SAY IF THE OPERATION WILL NOT BE A LENGTHY ONEAND IF MRS
 CASAUBON WILL NOT OBJECT TO THE DELAY
AS FOR DOROTHEA NOTHING COULD HAVE PLEASED HER MORE UNLESS IT HADBEEN A MIRACULOUS VOICE PRONOUNCING MR
 CASAUBON THE WISEST ANDWORTHIEST AMONG THE SONS OF MEN
 IN THAT CASE HER TOTTERING FAITH WOULDHAVE BECOME FIRM AGAIN
NAUMANNS APPARATUS WAS AT HAND IN WONDERFUL COMPLETENESS AND THESKETCH WENT ON AT ONCE AS WELL AS THE CONVERSATION
 DOROTHEA SAT DOWNAND SUBSIDED INTO CALM SILENCE FEELING HAPPIER THAN SHE HAD DONE FOR ALONG WHILE BEFORE
 EVERY ONE ABOUT HER SEEMED GOOD AND SHE SAID TOHERSELF THAT ROME IF SHE HAD ONLY BEEN LESS IGNORANT WOULD HAVE BEENFULL OF BEAUTY ITS SADNESS WOULD HAVE BEEN WINGED WITH HOPE
 NO NATURECOULD BE LESS SUSPICIOUS THAN HERS WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD SHE BELIEVEDIN THE GRATITUDE OF WASPS AND THE HONORABLE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SPARROWSAND WAS PROPORTIONATELY INDIGNANT WHEN THEIR BASENESS WAS MADEMANIFEST
THE ADROIT ARTIST WAS ASKING MR
 CASAUBON QUESTIONS ABOUT ENGLISHPOLITIES WHICH BROUGHT LONG ANSWERS AND WILL MEANWHILE HAD PERCHEDHIMSELF ON SOME STEPS IN THE BACKGROUND OVERLOOKING ALL
PRESENTLY NAUMANN SAIDNOW IF I COULD LAY THIS BY FOR HALF AN HOUR ANDTAKE IT UP AGAINCOME AND LOOK LADISLAWI THINK IT IS PERFECT SO FAR
WILL VENTED THOSE ADJURING INTERJECTIONS WHICH IMPLY THAT ADMIRATION ISTOO STRONG FOR SYNTAX AND NAUMANN SAID IN A TONE OF PITEOUS REGRETAHNOWIF I COULD BUT HAVE HAD MOREBUT YOU HAVE OTHER ENGAGEMENTSICOULD NOT ASK ITOR EVEN TO COME AGAIN TOMORROW
OH LET US STAY
 SAID DOROTHEA
 WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO TODAY EXCEPTGO ABOUT HAVE WE
 SHE ADDED LOOKING ENTREATINGLY AT MR
 CASAUBON
IT WOULD BE A PITY NOT TO MAKE THE HEAD AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE
I AM AT YOUR SERVICE SIR IN THE MATTER SAID MR
 CASAUBON WITHPOLITE CONDESCENSION
 HAVING GIVEN UP THE INTERIOR OF MY HEAD TOIDLENESS IT IS AS WELL THAT THE EXTERIOR SHOULD WORK IN THIS WAY
YOU ARE UNSPEAKABLY GOODNOW I AM HAPPY
 SAID NAUMANN AND THEN WENTON IN GERMAN TO WILL POINTING HERE AND THERE TO THE SKETCH AS IF HEWERE CONSIDERING THAT
 PUTTING IT ASIDE FOR A MOMENT HE LOOKED ROUNDVAGUELY AS IF SEEKING SOME OCCUPATION FOR HIS VISITORS AND AFTERWARDSTURNING TO MR
 CASAUBON SAIDPERHAPS THE BEAUTIFUL BRIDE THE GRACIOUS LADY WOULD NOT BE UNWILLINGTO LET ME FILL UP THE TIME BY TRYING TO MAKE A SLIGHT SKETCH OFHERNOT OF COURSE AS YOU SEE FOR THAT PICTUREONLY AS A SINGLESTUDY
MR
 CASAUBON BOWING DOUBTED NOT THAT MRS
 CASAUBON WOULD OBLIGE HIMAND DOROTHEA SAID AT ONCE WHERE SHALL I PUT MYSELF
NAUMANN WAS ALL APOLOGIES IN ASKING HER TO STAND AND ALLOW HIM TOADJUST HER ATTITUDE TO WHICH SHE SUBMITTED WITHOUT ANY OF THE AFFECTEDAIRS AND LAUGHS FREQUENTLY THOUGHT NECESSARY ON SUCH OCCASIONS WHENTHE PAINTER SAID IT IS AS SANTA CLARA THAT I WANT YOU TOSTANDLEANING SO WITH YOUR CHEEK AGAINST YOUR HANDSOLOOKING AT THATSTOOL PLEASE SO
WILL WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN THE INCLINATION TO FALL AT THE SAINTS FEETAND KISS HER ROBE AND THE TEMPTATION TO KNOCK NAUMANN DOWN WHILE HEWAS ADJUSTING HER ARM
 ALL THIS WAS IMPUDENCE AND DESECRATION AND HEREPENTED THAT HE HAD BROUGHT HER
THE ARTIST WAS DILIGENT AND WILL RECOVERING HIMSELF MOVED ABOUT ANDOCCUPIED MR
 CASAUBON AS INGENIOUSLY AS HE COULD BUT HE DID NOT IN THEEND PREVENT THE TIME FROM SEEMING LONG TO THAT GENTLEMAN AS WAS CLEARFROM HIS EXPRESSING A FEAR THAT MRS
 CASAUBON WOULD BE TIRED
 NAUMANNTOOK THE HINT AND SAIDNOW SIR IF YOU CAN OBLIGE ME AGAIN I WILL RELEASE THE LADYWIFE
SO MR
 CASAUBONS PATIENCE HELD OUT FURTHER AND WHEN AFTER ALL ITTURNED OUT THAT THE HEAD OF SAINT THOMAS AQUINAS WOULD BE MORE PERFECTIF ANOTHER SITTING COULD BE HAD IT WAS GRANTED FOR THE MORROW
 ON THEMORROW SANTA CLARA TOO WAS RETOUCHED MORE THAN ONCE
 THE RESULT OF ALLWAS SO FAR FROM DISPLEASING TO MR
 CASAUBON THAT HE ARRANGED FOR THEPURCHASE OF THE PICTURE IN WHICH SAINT THOMAS AQUINAS SAT AMONG THEDOCTORS OF THE CHURCH IN A DISPUTATION TOO ABSTRACT TO BE REPRESENTEDBUT LISTENED TO WITH MORE OR LESS ATTENTION BY AN AUDIENCE ABOVE
 THESANTA CLARA WHICH WAS SPOKEN OF IN THE SECOND PLACE NAUMANN DECLAREDHIMSELF TO BE DISSATISFIED WITHHE COULD NOT IN CONSCIENCE ENGAGE TOMAKE A WORTHY PICTURE OF IT SO ABOUT THE SANTA CLARA THE ARRANGEMENTWAS CONDITIONAL
I WILL NOT DWELL ON NAUMANNS JOKES AT THE EXPENSE OF MR
 CASAUBON THATEVENING OR ON HIS DITHYRAMBS ABOUT DOROTHEAS CHARM IN ALL WHICH WILLJOINED BUT WITH A DIFFERENCE
 NO SOONER DID NAUMANN MENTION ANY DETAILOF DOROTHEAS BEAUTY THAN WILL GOT EXASPERATED AT HIS PRESUMPTIONTHERE WAS GROSSNESS IN HIS CHOICE OF THE MOST ORDINARY WORDS AND WHATBUSINESS HAD HE TO TALK OF HER LIPS
 SHE WAS NOT A WOMAN TO BE SPOKENOF AS OTHER WOMEN WERE
 WILL COULD NOT SAY JUST WHAT HE THOUGHT BUT HEBECAME IRRITABLE
 AND YET WHEN AFTER SOME RESISTANCE HE HAD CONSENTEDTO TAKE THE CASAUBONS TO HIS FRIENDS STUDIO HE HAD BEEN ALLURED BYTHE GRATIFICATION OF HIS PRIDE IN BEING THE PERSON WHO COULD GRANTNAUMANN SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY OF STUDYING HER LOVELINESSOR RATHER HERDIVINENESS FOR THE ORDINARY PHRASES WHICH MIGHT APPLY TO MERE BODILYPRETTINESS WERE NOT APPLICABLE TO HER
 CERTAINLY ALL TIPTON AND ITSNEIGHBORHOOD AS WELL AS DOROTHEA HERSELF WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED ATHER BEAUTY BEING MADE SO MUCH OF
 IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD MISS BROOKEHAD BEEN ONLY A FINE YOUNG WOMAN
OBLIGE ME BY LETTING THE SUBJECT DROP NAUMANN
 MRS
 CASAUBON IS NOTTO BE TALKED OF AS IF SHE WERE A MODEL SAID WILL
 NAUMANN STARED ATHIM
SCHÖN
 I WILL TALK OF MY AQUINAS
 THE HEAD IS NOT A BAD TYPE AFTERALL
 I DARE SAY THE GREAT SCHOLASTIC HIMSELF WOULD HAVE BEEN FLATTEREDTO HAVE HIS PORTRAIT ASKED FOR
 NOTHING LIKE THESE STARCHY DOCTORS FORVANITY
 IT WAS AS I THOUGHT HE CARED MUCH LESS FOR HER PORTRAIT THANHIS OWN
HES A CURSED WHITEBLOODED PEDANTIC COXCOMB SAID WILL WITHGNASHING IMPETUOSITY
 HIS OBLIGATIONS TO MR
 CASAUBON WERE NOT KNOWN TOHIS HEARER BUT WILL HIMSELF WAS THINKING OF THEM AND WISHING THAT HECOULD DISCHARGE THEM ALL BY A CHECK
NAUMANN GAVE A SHRUG AND SAID IT IS GOOD THEY GO AWAY SOON MY DEAR
THEY ARE SPOILING YOUR FINE TEMPER
ALL WILLS HOPE AND CONTRIVANCE WERE NOW CONCENTRATED ON SEEINGDOROTHEA WHEN SHE WAS ALONE
 HE ONLY WANTED HER TO TAKE MORE EMPHATICNOTICE OF HIM HE ONLY WANTED TO BE SOMETHING MORE SPECIAL IN HERREMEMBRANCE THAN HE COULD YET BELIEVE HIMSELF LIKELY TO BE
 HE WASRATHER IMPATIENT UNDER THAT OPEN ARDENT GOODWILL WHICH HE SAW WAS HERUSUAL STATE OF FEELING
 THE REMOTE WORSHIP OF A WOMAN THRONED OUT OFTHEIR REACH PLAYS A GREAT PART IN MENS LIVES BUT IN MOST CASES THEWORSHIPPER LONGS FOR SOME QUEENLY RECOGNITION SOME APPROVING SIGN BYWHICH HIS SOULS SOVEREIGN MAY CHEER HIM WITHOUT DESCENDING FROM HERHIGH PLACE
 THAT WAS PRECISELY WHAT WILL WANTED
 BUT THERE WERE PLENTYOF CONTRADICTIONS IN HIS IMAGINATIVE DEMANDS
 IT WAS BEAUTIFUL TO SEEHOW DOROTHEAS EYES TURNED WITH WIFELY ANXIETY AND BESEECHING TO MR
CASAUBON SHE WOULD HAVE LOST SOME OF HER HALO IF SHE HAD BEEN WITHOUTTHAT DUTEOUS PREOCCUPATION AND YET AT THE NEXT MOMENT THE HUSBANDSSANDY ABSORPTION OF SUCH NECTAR WAS TOO INTOLERABLE AND WILLS LONGINGTO SAY DAMAGING THINGS ABOUT HIM WAS PERHAPS NOT THE LESS TORMENTINGBECAUSE HE FELT THE STRONGEST REASONS FOR RESTRAINING IT
WILL HAD NOT BEEN INVITED TO DINE THE NEXT DAY
 HENCE HE PERSUADEDHIMSELF THAT HE WAS BOUND TO CALL AND THAT THE ONLY ELIGIBLE TIME WASTHE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHEN MR
 CASAUBON WOULD NOT BE AT HOME
DOROTHEA WHO HAD NOT BEEN MADE AWARE THAT HER FORMER RECEPTION OF WILLHAD DISPLEASED HER HUSBAND HAD NO HESITATION ABOUT SEEING HIMESPECIALLY AS HE MIGHT BE COME TO PAY A FAREWELL VISIT
 WHEN HE ENTEREDSHE WAS LOOKING AT SOME CAMEOS WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BUYING FOR CELIA
 SHEGREETED WILL AS IF HIS VISIT WERE QUITE A MATTER OF COURSE AND SAID ATONCE HAVING A CAMEO BRACELET IN HER HANDI AM SO GLAD YOU ARE COME
 PERHAPS YOU UNDERSTAND ALL ABOUT CAMEOSAND CAN TELL ME IF THESE ARE REALLY GOOD
 I WISHED TO HAVE YOU WITH USIN CHOOSING THEM BUT MR
 CASAUBON OBJECTED HE THOUGHT THERE WAS NOTTIME
 HE WILL FINISH HIS WORK TOMORROW AND WE SHALL GO AWAY IN THREEDAYS
 I HAVE BEEN UNEASY ABOUT THESE CAMEOS
 PRAY SIT DOWN AND LOOK ATTHEM
I AM NOT PARTICULARLY KNOWING BUT THERE CAN BE NO GREAT MISTAKE ABOUTTHESE LITTLE HOMERIC BITS THEY ARE EXQUISITELY NEAT
 AND THE COLOR ISFINE IT WILL JUST SUIT YOU
OH THEY ARE FOR MY SISTER WHO HAS QUITE A DIFFERENT COMPLEXION
 YOUSAW HER WITH ME AT LOWICK SHE IS LIGHTHAIRED AND VERY PRETTYAT LEASTI THINK SO
 WE WERE NEVER SO LONG AWAY FROM EACH OTHER IN OUR LIVESBEFORE
 SHE IS A GREAT PET AND NEVER WAS NAUGHTY IN HER LIFE
 I FOUNDOUT BEFORE I CAME AWAY THAT SHE WANTED ME TO BUY HER SOME CAMEOS AND ISHOULD BE SORRY FOR THEM NOT TO BE GOODAFTER THEIR KIND
 DOROTHEAADDED THE LAST WORDS WITH A SMILE
YOU SEEM NOT TO CARE ABOUT CAMEOS SAID WILL SEATING HIMSELF AT SOMEDISTANCE FROM HER AND OBSERVING HER WHILE SHE CLOSED THE CASES
NO FRANKLY I DONT THINK THEM A GREAT OBJECT IN LIFE SAIDDOROTHEA
I FEAR YOU ARE A HERETIC ABOUT ART GENERALLY
 HOW IS THAT
 I SHOULDHAVE EXPECTED YOU TO BE VERY SENSITIVE TO THE BEAUTIFUL EVERYWHERE
I SUPPOSE I AM DULL ABOUT MANY THINGS SAID DOROTHEA SIMPLY
 ISHOULD LIKE TO MAKE LIFE BEAUTIFULI MEAN EVERYBODYS LIFE
 AND THENALL THIS IMMENSE EXPENSE OF ART THAT SEEMS SOMEHOW TO LIE OUTSIDE LIFEAND MAKE IT NO BETTER FOR THE WORLD PAINS ONE
 IT SPOILS MY ENJOYMENTOF ANYTHING WHEN I AM MADE TO THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE SHUT OUT FROMIT
I CALL THAT THE FANATICISM OF SYMPATHY SAID WILL IMPETUOUSLY
 YOUMIGHT SAY THE SAME OF LANDSCAPE OF POETRY OF ALL REFINEMENT
 IF YOUCARRIED IT OUT YOU OUGHT TO BE MISERABLE IN YOUR OWN GOODNESS AND TURNEVIL THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE NO ADVANTAGE OVER OTHERS
 THE BEST PIETY IS TOENJOYWHEN YOU CAN
 YOU ARE DOING THE MOST THEN TO SAVE THE EARTHSCHARACTER AS AN AGREEABLE PLANET
 AND ENJOYMENT RADIATES
 IT IS OF NOUSE TO TRY AND TAKE CARE OF ALL THE WORLD THAT IS BEING TAKEN CARE OFWHEN YOU FEEL DELIGHTIN ART OR IN ANYTHING ELSE
 WOULD YOU TURN ALLTHE YOUTH OF THE WORLD INTO A TRAGIC CHORUS WAILING AND MORALIZINGOVER MISERY
 I SUSPECT THAT YOU HAVE SOME FALSE BELIEF IN THE VIRTUESOF MISERY AND WANT TO MAKE YOUR LIFE A MARTYRDOM
 WILL HAD GONEFURTHER THAN HE INTENDED AND CHECKED HIMSELF
 BUT DOROTHEAS THOUGHTWAS NOT TAKING JUST THE SAME DIRECTION AS HIS OWN AND SHE ANSWEREDWITHOUT ANY SPECIAL EMOTIONINDEED YOU MISTAKE ME
 I AM NOT A SAD MELANCHOLY CREATURE
 I AM NEVERUNHAPPY LONG TOGETHER
 I AM ANGRY AND NAUGHTYNOT LIKE CELIA I HAVE AGREAT OUTBURST AND THEN ALL SEEMS GLORIOUS AGAIN
 I CANNOT HELPBELIEVING IN GLORIOUS THINGS IN A BLIND SORT OF WAY
 I SHOULD BE QUITEWILLING TO ENJOY THE ART HERE BUT THERE IS SO MUCH THAT I DONT KNOWTHE REASON OFSO MUCH THAT SEEMS TO ME A CONSECRATION OF UGLINESSRATHER THAN BEAUTY
 THE PAINTING AND SCULPTURE MAY BE WONDERFUL BUTTHE FEELING IS OFTEN LOW AND BRUTAL AND SOMETIMES EVEN RIDICULOUS
HERE AND THERE I SEE WHAT TAKES ME AT ONCE AS NOBLESOMETHING THAT IMIGHT COMPARE WITH THE ALBAN MOUNTAINS OR THE SUNSET FROM THE PINCIANHILL BUT THAT MAKES IT THE GREATER PITY THAT THERE IS SO LITTLE OF THEBEST KIND AMONG ALL THAT MASS OF THINGS OVER WHICH MEN HAVE TOILED SO
OF COURSE THERE IS ALWAYS A GREAT DEAL OF POOR WORK THE RARER THINGSWANT THAT SOIL TO GROW IN
OH DEAR SAID DOROTHEA TAKING UP THAT THOUGHT INTO THE CHIEF CURRENTOF HER ANXIETY I SEE IT MUST BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DO ANYTHING GOOD
 IHAVE OFTEN FELT SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN ROME THAT MOST OF OUR LIVES WOULDLOOK MUCH UGLIER AND MORE BUNGLING THAN THE PICTURES IF THEY COULD BEPUT ON THE WALL
DOROTHEA PARTED HER LIPS AGAIN AS IF SHE WERE GOING TO SAY MORE BUTCHANGED HER MIND AND PAUSED
YOU ARE TOO YOUNGIT IS AN ANACHRONISM FOR YOU TO HAVE SUCH THOUGHTSSAID WILL ENERGETICALLY WITH A QUICK SHAKE OF THE HEAD HABITUAL TOHIM
 YOU TALK AS IF YOU HAD NEVER KNOWN ANY YOUTH
 IT IS MONSTROUSASIF YOU HAD HAD A VISION OF HADES IN YOUR CHILDHOOD LIKE THE BOY IN THELEGEND
 YOU HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN SOME OF THOSE HORRIBLE NOTIONS THATCHOOSE THE SWEETEST WOMEN TO DEVOURLIKE MINOTAURS
 AND NOW YOU WILL GOAND BE SHUT UP IN THAT STONE PRISON AT LOWICK YOU WILL BE BURIEDALIVE
 IT MAKES ME SAVAGE TO THINK OF IT
 I WOULD RATHER NEVER HAVESEEN YOU THAN THINK OF YOU WITH SUCH A PROSPECT
WILL AGAIN FEARED THAT HE HAD GONE TOO FAR BUT THE MEANING WE ATTACHTO WORDS DEPENDS ON OUR FEELING AND HIS TONE OF ANGRY REGRET HAD SOMUCH KINDNESS IN IT FOR DOROTHEAS HEART WHICH HAD ALWAYS BEEN GIVINGOUT ARDOR AND HAD NEVER BEEN FED WITH MUCH FROM THE LIVING BEINGSAROUND HER THAT SHE FELT A NEW SENSE OF GRATITUDE AND ANSWERED WITH AGENTLE SMILEIT IS VERY GOOD OF YOU TO BE ANXIOUS ABOUT ME
 IT IS BECAUSE YOU DIDNOT LIKE LOWICK YOURSELF YOU HAD SET YOUR HEART ON ANOTHER KIND OFLIFE
 BUT LOWICK IS MY CHOSEN HOME
THE LAST SENTENCE WAS SPOKEN WITH AN ALMOST SOLEMN CADENCE AND WILLDID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY SINCE IT WOULD NOT BE USEFUL FOR HIM TOEMBRACE HER SLIPPERS AND TELL HER THAT HE WOULD DIE FOR HER IT WASCLEAR THAT SHE REQUIRED NOTHING OF THE SORT AND THEY WERE BOTH SILENTFOR A MOMENT OR TWO WHEN DOROTHEA BEGAN AGAIN WITH AN AIR OF SAYING ATLAST WHAT HAD BEEN IN HER MIND BEFOREHAND
I WANTED TO ASK YOU AGAIN ABOUT SOMETHING YOU SAID THE OTHER DAY
PERHAPS IT WAS HALF OF IT YOUR LIVELY WAY OF SPEAKING I NOTICE THATYOU LIKE TO PUT THINGS STRONGLY I MYSELF OFTEN EXAGGERATE WHEN I SPEAKHASTILY
WHAT WAS IT
 SAID WILL OBSERVING THAT SHE SPOKE WITH A TIMIDITYQUITE NEW IN HER
 I HAVE A HYPERBOLICAL TONGUE IT CATCHES FIRE AS ITGOES
 I DARE SAY I SHALL HAVE TO RETRACT
I MEAN WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE NECESSITY OF KNOWING GERMANI MEAN FORTHE SUBJECTS THAT MR
 CASAUBON IS ENGAGED IN
 I HAVE BEEN THINKINGABOUT IT AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WITH MR
 CASAUBONS LEARNING HE MUSTHAVE BEFORE HIM THE SAME MATERIALS AS GERMAN SCHOLARSHAS HE NOT
DOROTHEAS TIMIDITY WAS DUE TO AN INDISTINCT CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE WASIN THE STRANGE SITUATION OF CONSULTING A THIRD PERSON ABOUT THEADEQUACY OF MR
 CASAUBONS LEARNING
NOT EXACTLY THE SAME MATERIALS SAID WILL THINKING THAT HE WOULD BEDULY RESERVED
 HE IS NOT AN ORIENTALIST YOU KNOW
 HE DOES NOT PROFESSTO HAVE MORE THAN SECONDHAND KNOWLEDGE THERE
BUT THERE ARE VERY VALUABLE BOOKS ABOUT ANTIQUITIES WHICH WERE WRITTENA LONG WHILE AGO BY SCHOLARS WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THESE MODERNTHINGS AND THEY ARE STILL USED
 WHY SHOULD MR
 CASAUBONS NOT BEVALUABLE LIKE THEIRS
 SAID DOROTHEA WITH MORE REMONSTRANT ENERGY
SHE WAS IMPELLED TO HAVE THE ARGUMENT ALOUD WHICH SHE HAD BEEN HAVINGIN HER OWN MIND
THAT DEPENDS ON THE LINE OF STUDY TAKEN SAID WILL ALSO GETTING ATONE OF REJOINDER
 THE SUBJECT MR
 CASAUBON HAS CHOSEN IS AS CHANGINGAS CHEMISTRY NEW DISCOVERIES ARE CONSTANTLY MAKING NEW POINTS OF VIEW
WHO WANTS A SYSTEM ON THE BASIS OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS OR A BOOK TOREFUTE PARACELSUS
 DO YOU NOT SEE THAT IT IS NO USE NOW TO BE CRAWLINGA LITTLE WAY AFTER MEN OF THE LAST CENTURYMEN LIKE BRYANTANDCORRECTING THEIR MISTAKES
LIVING IN A LUMBERROOM AND FURBISHING UPBROKENLEGGED THEORIES ABOUT CHUS AND MIZRAIM
HOW CAN YOU BEAR TO SPEAK SO LIGHTLY
 SAID DOROTHEA WITH A LOOKBETWEEN SORROW AND ANGER
 IF IT WERE AS YOU SAY WHAT COULD BE SADDERTHAN SO MUCH ARDENT LABOR ALL IN VAIN
 I WONDER IT DOES NOT AFFECT YOUMORE PAINFULLY IF YOU REALLY THINK THAT A MAN LIKE MR
 CASAUBON OF SOMUCH GOODNESS POWER AND LEARNING SHOULD IN ANY WAY FAIL IN WHAT HASBEEN THE LABOR OF HIS BEST YEARS
 SHE WAS BEGINNING TO BE SHOCKED THATSHE HAD GOT TO SUCH A POINT OF SUPPOSITION AND INDIGNANT WITH WILL FORHAVING LED HER TO IT
YOU QUESTIONED ME ABOUT THE MATTER OF FACT NOT OF FEELING SAIDWILL
 BUT IF YOU WISH TO PUNISH ME FOR THE FACT I SUBMIT
 I AM NOT INA POSITION TO EXPRESS MY FEELING TOWARD MR
 CASAUBON IT WOULD BE ATBEST A PENSIONERS EULOGY
PRAY EXCUSE ME SAID DOROTHEA COLORING DEEPLY
 I AM AWARE AS YOUSAY THAT I AM IN FAULT IN HAVING INTRODUCED THE SUBJECT
 INDEED I AMWRONG ALTOGETHER
 FAILURE AFTER LONG PERSEVERANCE IS MUCH GRANDER THANNEVER TO HAVE A STRIVING GOOD ENOUGH TO BE CALLED A FAILURE
I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU SAID WILL DETERMINED TO CHANGE THESITUATIONSO MUCH SO THAT I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND NOT TO RUN THAT RISKOF NEVER ATTAINING A FAILURE
 MR
 CASAUBONS GENEROSITY HAS PERHAPSBEEN DANGEROUS TO ME AND I MEAN TO RENOUNCE THE LIBERTY IT HAS GIVENME
 I MEAN TO GO BACK TO ENGLAND SHORTLY AND WORK MY OWN WAYDEPEND ONNOBODY ELSE THAN MYSELF
THAT IS FINEI RESPECT THAT FEELING SAID DOROTHEA WITH RETURNINGKINDNESS
 BUT MR
 CASAUBON I AM SURE HAS NEVER THOUGHT OF ANYTHINGIN THE MATTER EXCEPT WHAT WAS MOST FOR YOUR WELFARE
SHE HAS OBSTINACY AND PRIDE ENOUGH TO SERVE INSTEAD OF LOVE NOW SHEHAS MARRIED HIM SAID WILL TO HIMSELF
 ALOUD HE SAID RISINGI SHALL NOT SEE YOU AGAIN
OH STAY TILL MR
 CASAUBON COMES SAID DOROTHEA EARNESTLY
 I AM SOGLAD WE MET IN ROME
 I WANTED TO KNOW YOU
AND I HAVE MADE YOU ANGRY SAID WILL
 I HAVE MADE YOU THINK ILL OFME
OH NO
 MY SISTER TELLS ME I AM ALWAYS ANGRY WITH PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SAYJUST WHAT I LIKE
 BUT I HOPE I AM NOT GIVEN TO THINK ILL OF THEM
 INTHE END I AM USUALLY OBLIGED TO THINK ILL OF MYSELF FOR BEING SOIMPATIENT
STILL YOU DONT LIKE ME I HAVE MADE MYSELF AN UNPLEASANT THOUGHT TOYOU
NOT AT ALL SAID DOROTHEA WITH THE MOST OPEN KINDNESS
 I LIKE YOUVERY MUCH
WILL WAS NOT QUITE CONTENTED THINKING THAT HE WOULD APPARENTLY HAVEBEEN OF MORE IMPORTANCE IF HE HAD BEEN DISLIKED
 HE SAID NOTHING BUTLOOKED DULL NOT TO SAY SULKY
AND I AM QUITE INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT YOU WILL DO DOROTHEA WENT ONCHEERFULLY
 I BELIEVE DEVOUTLY IN A NATURAL DIFFERENCE OF VOCATION
 IFIT WERE NOT FOR THAT BELIEF I SUPPOSE I SHOULD BE VERY NARROWTHEREARE SO MANY THINGS BESIDES PAINTING THAT I AM QUITE IGNORANT OF
 YOUWOULD HARDLY BELIEVE HOW LITTLE I HAVE TAKEN IN OF MUSIC ANDLITERATURE WHICH YOU KNOW SO MUCH OF
 I WONDER WHAT YOUR VOCATION WILLTURN OUT TO BE PERHAPS YOU WILL BE A POET
THAT DEPENDS
 TO BE A POET IS TO HAVE A SOUL SO QUICK TO DISCERN THATNO SHADE OF QUALITY ESCAPES IT AND SO QUICK TO FEEL THAT DISCERNMENTIS BUT A HAND PLAYING WITH FINELY ORDERED VARIETY ON THE CHORDS OFEMOTIONA SOUL IN WHICH KNOWLEDGE PASSES INSTANTANEOUSLY INTO FEELINGAND FEELING FLASHES BACK AS A NEW ORGAN OF KNOWLEDGE
 ONE MAY HAVE THATCONDITION BY FITS ONLY
BUT YOU LEAVE OUT THE POEMS SAID DOROTHEA
 I THINK THEY ARE WANTEDTO COMPLETE THE POET
 I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN ABOUT KNOWLEDGEPASSING INTO FEELING FOR THAT SEEMS TO BE JUST WHAT I EXPERIENCE
 BUTI AM SURE I COULD NEVER PRODUCE A POEM
YOU ARE A POEMAND THAT IS TO BE THE BEST PART OF A POETWHAT MAKESUP THE POETS CONSCIOUSNESS IN HIS BEST MOODS SAID WILL SHOWING SUCHORIGINALITY AS WE ALL SHARE WITH THE MORNING AND THE SPRINGTIME ANDOTHER ENDLESS RENEWALS
I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID DOROTHEA LAUGHING OUT HER WORDS IN ABIRDLIKE MODULATION AND LOOKING AT WILL WITH PLAYFUL GRATITUDE IN HEREYES

 CASAUBON
 THERE WASA CERTAIN LIQUID BRIGHTNESS IN HER EYES AND WILL WAS CONSCIOUS THATHIS OWN WERE OBEYING A LAW OF NATURE AND FILLING TOO
 THE ALLUSION TOMR
 CASAUBON WOULD HAVE SPOILED ALL IF ANYTHING AT THAT MOMENT COULDHAVE SPOILED THE SUBDUING POWER THE SWEET DIGNITY OF HER NOBLEUNSUSPICIOUS INEXPERIENCE
AND THERE IS ONE THING EVEN NOW THAT YOU CAN DO SAID DOROTHEARISING AND WALKING A LITTLE WAY UNDER THE STRENGTH OF A RECURRINGIMPULSE
 PROMISE ME THAT YOU WILL NOT AGAIN TO ANY ONE SPEAK OF THATSUBJECTI MEAN ABOUT MR
 CASAUBONS WRITINGSI MEAN IN THAT KIND OFWAY

 BUT PROMISE ME
SHE HAD RETURNED FROM HER BRIEF PACING AND STOOD OPPOSITE WILL LOOKINGGRAVELY AT HIM
CERTAINLY I WILL PROMISE YOU SAID WILL REDDENING HOWEVER
 IF HENEVER SAID A CUTTING WORD ABOUT MR
 CASAUBON AGAIN AND LEFT OFFRECEIVING FAVORS FROM HIM IT WOULD CLEARLY BE PERMISSIBLE TO HATE HIMTHE MORE
 THE POET MUST KNOW HOW TO HATE SAYS GOETHE AND WILL WAS ATLEAST READY WITH THAT ACCOMPLISHMENT
 HE SAID THAT HE MUST GO NOWWITHOUT WAITING FOR MR
 CASAUBON WHOM HE WOULD COME TO TAKE LEAVE OFAT THE LAST MOMENT
 DOROTHEA GAVE HIM HER HAND AND THEY EXCHANGED ASIMPLE GOODBY
BUT GOING OUT OF THE PORTE COCHERE HE MET MR
 CASAUBON AND THATGENTLEMAN EXPRESSING THE BEST WISHES FOR HIS COUSIN POLITELY WAIVEDTHE PLEASURE OF ANY FURTHER LEAVETAKING ON THE MORROW WHICH WOULD BESUFFICIENTLY CROWDED WITH THE PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE

 LADISLAW WHICH ITHINK WILL HEIGHTEN YOUR OPINION OF HIM SAID DOROTHEA TO HER HUSBANDIN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING
 SHE HAD MENTIONED IMMEDIATELY ON HISENTERING THAT WILL HAD JUST GONE AWAY AND WOULD COME AGAIN BUT MR
CASAUBON HAD SAID I MET HIM OUTSIDE AND WE MADE OUR FINAL ADIEUX IBELIEVE SAYING THIS WITH THE AIR AND TONE BY WHICH WE IMPLY THAT ANYSUBJECT WHETHER PRIVATE OR PUBLIC DOES NOT INTEREST US ENOUGH TO WISHFOR A FURTHER REMARK UPON IT

WAITING FOR DEATH
CHAPTER XXIII
YOUR HORSES OF THE SUN HE SAID    AND FIRSTRATE WHIP APOLLO
WHATEER THEY BE ILL EAT MY HEAD    BUT I WILL BEAT THEM HOLLOW
FRED VINCY WE HAVE SEEN HAD A DEBT ON HIS MIND AND THOUGH NO SUCHIMMATERIAL BURTHEN COULD DEPRESS THAT BUOYANTHEARTED YOUNG GENTLEMANFOR MANY HOURS TOGETHER THERE WERE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THISDEBT WHICH MADE THE THOUGHT OF IT UNUSUALLY IMPORTUNATE
 THE CREDITORWAS MR
 BAMBRIDGE A HORSEDEALER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHOSE COMPANYWAS MUCH SOUGHT IN MIDDLEMARCH BY YOUNG MEN UNDERSTOOD TO BE ADDICTEDTO PLEASURE
 DURING THE VACATIONS FRED HAD NATURALLY REQUIRED MOREAMUSEMENTS THAN HE HAD READY MONEY FOR AND MR
 BAMBRIDGE HAD BEENACCOMMODATING ENOUGH NOT ONLY TO TRUST HIM FOR THE HIRE OF HORSES ANDTHE ACCIDENTAL EXPENSE OF RUINING A FINE HUNTER BUT ALSO TO MAKE ASMALL ADVANCE BY WHICH HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MEET SOME LOSSES ATBILLIARDS
 THE TOTAL DEBT WAS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY POUNDS
 BAMBRIDGE WASIN NO ALARM ABOUT HIS MONEY BEING SURE THAT YOUNG VINCY HAD BACKERSBUT HE HAD REQUIRED SOMETHING TO SHOW FOR IT AND FRED HAD AT FIRSTGIVEN A BILL WITH HIS OWN SIGNATURE
 THREE MONTHS LATER HE HAD RENEWEDTHIS BILL WITH THE SIGNATURE OF CALEB GARTH
 ON BOTH OCCASIONS FRED HADFELT CONFIDENT THAT HE SHOULD MEET THE BILL HIMSELF HAVING AMPLE FUNDSAT DISPOSAL IN HIS OWN HOPEFULNESS
 YOU WILL HARDLY DEMAND THAT HISCONFIDENCE SHOULD HAVE A BASIS IN EXTERNAL FACTS SUCH CONFIDENCE WEKNOW IS SOMETHING LESS COARSE AND MATERIALISTIC IT IS A COMFORTABLEDISPOSITION LEADING US TO EXPECT THAT THE WISDOM OF PROVIDENCE OR THEFOLLY OF OUR FRIENDS THE MYSTERIES OF LUCK OR THE STILL GREATERMYSTERY OF OUR HIGH INDIVIDUAL VALUE IN THE UNIVERSE WILL BRING ABOUTAGREEABLE ISSUES SUCH AS ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR GOOD TASTE INCOSTUME AND OUR GENERAL PREFERENCE FOR THE BEST STYLE OF THING
 FREDFELT SURE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE A PRESENT FROM HIS UNCLE THAT HE SHOULDHAVE A RUN OF LUCK THAT BY DINT OF SWAPPING HE SHOULD GRADUALLYMETAMORPHOSE A HORSE WORTH FORTY POUNDS INTO A HORSE THAT WOULD FETCH AHUNDRED AT ANY MOMENTJUDGMENT BEING ALWAYS EQUIVALENT TO ANUNSPECIFIED SUM IN HARD CASH
 AND IN ANY CASE EVEN SUPPOSING NEGATIONSWHICH ONLY A MORBID DISTRUST COULD IMAGINE FRED HAD ALWAYS AT THATTIME HIS FATHERS POCKET AS A LAST RESOURCE SO THAT HIS ASSETS OFHOPEFULNESS HAD A SORT OF GORGEOUS SUPERFLUITY ABOUT THEM
 OF WHATMIGHT BE THE CAPACITY OF HIS FATHERS POCKET FRED HAD ONLY A VAGUENOTION WAS NOT TRADE ELASTIC
 AND WOULD NOT THE DEFICIENCIES OF ONEYEAR BE MADE UP FOR BY THE SURPLUS OF ANOTHER
 THE VINCYS LIVED IN ANEASY PROFUSE WAY NOT WITH ANY NEW OSTENTATION BUT ACCORDING TO THEFAMILY HABITS AND TRADITIONS SO THAT THE CHILDREN HAD NO STANDARD OFECONOMY AND THE ELDER ONES RETAINED SOME OF THEIR INFANTINE NOTIONTHAT THEIR FATHER MIGHT PAY FOR ANYTHING IF HE WOULD
 MR
 VINCY HIMSELFHAD EXPENSIVE MIDDLEMARCH HABITSSPENT MONEY ON COURSING ON HISCELLAR AND ON DINNERGIVING WHILE MAMMA HAD THOSE RUNNING ACCOUNTSWITH TRADESPEOPLE WHICH GIVE A CHEERFUL SENSE OF GETTING EVERYTHINGONE WANTS WITHOUT ANY QUESTION OF PAYMENT
 BUT IT WAS IN THE NATURE OFFATHERS FRED KNEW TO BULLY ONE ABOUT EXPENSES THERE WAS ALWAYS ALITTLE STORM OVER HIS EXTRAVAGANCE IF HE HAD TO DISCLOSE A DEBT ANDFRED DISLIKED BAD WEATHER WITHIN DOORS
 HE WAS TOO FILIAL TO BEDISRESPECTFUL TO HIS FATHER AND HE BORE THE THUNDER WITH THE CERTAINTYTHAT IT WAS TRANSIENT BUT IN THE MEAN TIME IT WAS DISAGREEABLE TO SEEHIS MOTHER CRY AND ALSO TO BE OBLIGED TO LOOK SULKY INSTEAD OF HAVINGFUN FOR FRED WAS SO GOODTEMPERED THAT IF HE LOOKED GLUM UNDERSCOLDING IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR PROPRIETYS SAKE
 THE EASIER COURSEPLAINLY WAS TO RENEW THE BILL WITH A FRIENDS SIGNATURE
 WHY NOT
 WITHTHE SUPERFLUOUS SECURITIES OF HOPE AT HIS COMMAND THERE WAS NO REASONWHY HE SHOULD NOT HAVE INCREASED OTHER PEOPLES LIABILITIES TO ANYEXTENT BUT FOR THE FACT THAT MEN WHOSE NAMES WERE GOOD FOR ANYTHINGWERE USUALLY PESSIMISTS INDISPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT THE UNIVERSAL ORDEROF THINGS WOULD NECESSARILY BE AGREEABLE TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNGGENTLEMAN
WITH A FAVOR TO ASK WE REVIEW OUR LIST OF FRIENDS DO JUSTICE TO THEIRMORE AMIABLE QUALITIES FORGIVE THEIR LITTLE OFFENSES AND CONCERNINGEACH IN TURN TRY TO ARRIVE AT THE CONCLUSION THAT HE WILL BE EAGER TOOBLIGE US OUR OWN EAGERNESS TO BE OBLIGED BEING AS COMMUNICABLE ASOTHER WARMTH
 STILL THERE IS ALWAYS A CERTAIN NUMBER WHO ARE DISMISSEDAS BUT MODERATELY EAGER UNTIL THE OTHERS HAVE REFUSED AND IT HAPPENEDTHAT FRED CHECKED OFF ALL HIS FRIENDS BUT ONE ON THE GROUND THATAPPLYING TO THEM WOULD BE DISAGREEABLE BEING IMPLICITLY CONVINCED THATHE AT LEAST WHATEVER MIGHT BE MAINTAINED ABOUT MANKIND GENERALLY HADA RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM ANYTHING DISAGREEABLE
 THAT HE SHOULD EVER FALLINTO A THOROUGHLY UNPLEASANT POSITIONWEAR TROUSERS SHRUNK WITHWASHING EAT COLD MUTTON HAVE TO WALK FOR WANT OF A HORSE OR TO DUCKUNDER IN ANY SORT OF WAYWAS AN ABSURDITY IRRECONCILABLE WITH THOSECHEERFUL INTUITIONS IMPLANTED IN HIM BY NATURE
 AND FRED WINCED UNDERTHE IDEA OF BEING LOOKED DOWN UPON AS WANTING FUNDS FOR SMALL DEBTS
THUS IT CAME TO PASS THAT THE FRIEND WHOM HE CHOSE TO APPLY TO WAS ATONCE THE POOREST AND THE KINDESTNAMELY CALEB GARTH
THE GARTHS WERE VERY FOND OF FRED AS HE WAS OF THEM FOR WHEN HE ANDROSAMOND WERE LITTLE ONES AND THE GARTHS WERE BETTER OFF THE SLIGHTCONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO FAMILIES THROUGH MR
 FEATHERSTONES DOUBLEMARRIAGE THE FIRST TO MR
 GARTHS SISTER AND THE SECOND TO MRS
VINCYS HAD LED TO AN ACQUAINTANCE WHICH WAS CARRIED ON BETWEEN THECHILDREN RATHER THAN THE PARENTS THE CHILDREN DRANK TEA TOGETHER OUTOF THEIR TOY TEACUPS AND SPENT WHOLE DAYS TOGETHER IN PLAY
 MARY WAS ALITTLE HOYDEN AND FRED AT SIX YEARS OLD THOUGHT HER THE NICEST GIRL INTHE WORLD MAKING HER HIS WIFE WITH A BRASS RING WHICH HE HAD CUT FROMAN UMBRELLA
 THROUGH ALL THE STAGES OF HIS EDUCATION HE HAD KEPT HISAFFECTION FOR THE GARTHS AND HIS HABIT OF GOING TO THEIR HOUSE AS ASECOND HOME THOUGH ANY INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THEM AND THE ELDERS OF HISFAMILY HAD LONG CEASED
 EVEN WHEN CALEB GARTH WAS PROSPEROUS THEVINCYS WERE ON CONDESCENDING TERMS WITH HIM AND HIS WIFE FOR THEREWERE NICE DISTINCTIONS OF RANK IN MIDDLEMARCH AND THOUGH OLDMANUFACTURERS COULD NOT ANY MORE THAN DUKES BE CONNECTED WITH NONE BUTEQUALS THEY WERE CONSCIOUS OF AN INHERENT SOCIAL SUPERIORITY WHICH WASDEFINED WITH GREAT NICETY IN PRACTICE THOUGH HARDLY EXPRESSIBLETHEORETICALLY
 SINCE THEN MR
 GARTH HAD FAILED IN THE BUILDINGBUSINESS WHICH HE HAD UNFORTUNATELY ADDED TO HIS OTHER AVOCATIONS OFSURVEYOR VALUER AND AGENT HAD CONDUCTED THAT BUSINESS FOR A TIMEENTIRELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS ASSIGNEES AND HAD BEEN LIVINGNARROWLY EXERTING HIMSELF TO THE UTMOST THAT HE MIGHT AFTER ALL PAYTWENTY SHILLINGS IN THE POUND
 HE HAD NOW ACHIEVED THIS AND FROM ALLWHO DID NOT THINK IT A BAD PRECEDENT HIS HONORABLE EXERTIONS HAD WONHIM DUE ESTEEM BUT IN NO PART OF THE WORLD IS GENTEEL VISITING FOUNDEDON ESTEEM IN THE ABSENCE OF SUITABLE FURNITURE AND COMPLETEDINNERSERVICE
 MRS
 VINCY HAD NEVER BEEN AT HER EASE WITH MRS
 GARTHAND FREQUENTLY SPOKE OF HER AS A WOMAN WHO HAD HAD TO WORK FOR HERBREADMEANING THAT MRS
 GARTH HAD BEEN A TEACHER BEFORE HER MARRIAGEIN WHICH CASE AN INTIMACY WITH LINDLEY MURRAY AND MANGNALLS QUESTIONSWAS SOMETHING LIKE A DRAPERS DISCRIMINATION OF CALICO TRADEMARKS OR ACOURIERS ACQUAINTANCE WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES NO WOMAN WHO WAS BETTEROFF NEEDED THAT SORT OF THING
 AND SINCE MARY HAD BEEN KEEPING MR
FEATHERSTONES HOUSE MRS
 VINCYS WANT OF LIKING FOR THE GARTHS HADBEEN CONVERTED INTO SOMETHING MORE POSITIVE BY ALARM LEST FRED SHOULDENGAGE HIMSELF TO THIS PLAIN GIRL WHOSE PARENTS LIVED IN SUCH A SMALLWAY
 FRED BEING AWARE OF THIS NEVER SPOKE AT HOME OF HIS VISITS TOMRS
 GARTH WHICH HAD OF LATE BECOME MORE FREQUENT THE INCREASINGARDOR OF HIS AFFECTION FOR MARY INCLINING HIM THE MORE TOWARDS THOSEWHO BELONGED TO HER
MR
 GARTH HAD A SMALL OFFICE IN THE TOWN AND TO THIS FRED WENT WITHHIS REQUEST
 HE OBTAINED IT WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY FOR A LARGE AMOUNTOF PAINFUL EXPERIENCE HAD NOT SUFFICED TO MAKE CALEB GARTH CAUTIOUSABOUT HIS OWN AFFAIRS OR DISTRUSTFUL OF HIS FELLOWMEN WHEN THEY HADNOT PROVED THEMSELVES UNTRUSTWORTHY AND HE HAD THE HIGHEST OPINION OFFRED WAS SURE THE LAD WOULD TURN OUT WELLAN OPEN AFFECTIONATEFELLOW WITH A GOOD BOTTOM TO HIS CHARACTERYOU MIGHT TRUST HIM FORANYTHING
 SUCH WAS CALEBS PSYCHOLOGICAL ARGUMENT
 HE WAS ONE OF THOSERARE MEN WHO ARE RIGID TO THEMSELVES AND INDULGENT TO OTHERS
 HE HAD ACERTAIN SHAME ABOUT HIS NEIGHBORS ERRORS AND NEVER SPOKE OF THEMWILLINGLY HENCE HE WAS NOT LIKELY TO DIVERT HIS MIND FROM THE BESTMODE OF HARDENING TIMBER AND OTHER INGENIOUS DEVICES IN ORDER TOPRECONCEIVE THOSE ERRORS
 IF HE HAD TO BLAME ANY ONE IT WAS NECESSARYFOR HIM TO MOVE ALL THE PAPERS WITHIN HIS REACH OR DESCRIBE VARIOUSDIAGRAMS WITH HIS STICK OR MAKE CALCULATIONS WITH THE ODD MONEY IN HISPOCKET BEFORE HE COULD BEGIN AND HE WOULD RATHER DO OTHER MENS WORKTHAN FIND FAULT WITH THEIR DOING
 I FEAR HE WAS A BAD DISCIPLINARIAN
WHEN FRED STATED THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS DEBT HIS WISH TO MEET ITWITHOUT TROUBLING HIS FATHER AND THE CERTAINTY THAT THE MONEY WOULD BEFORTHCOMING SO AS TO CAUSE NO ONE ANY INCONVENIENCE CALEB PUSHED HISSPECTACLES UPWARD LISTENED LOOKED INTO HIS FAVORITES CLEAR YOUNGEYES AND BELIEVED HIM NOT DISTINGUISHING CONFIDENCE ABOUT THE FUTUREFROM VERACITY ABOUT THE PAST BUT HE FELT THAT IT WAS AN OCCASION FOR AFRIENDLY HINT AS TO CONDUCT AND THAT BEFORE GIVING HIS SIGNATURE HEMUST GIVE A RATHER STRONG ADMONITION
 ACCORDINGLY HE TOOK THE PAPERAND LOWERED HIS SPECTACLES MEASURED THE SPACE AT HIS COMMAND REACHEDHIS PEN AND EXAMINED IT DIPPED IT IN THE INK AND EXAMINED IT AGAINTHEN PUSHED THE PAPER A LITTLE WAY FROM HIM LIFTED UP HIS SPECTACLESAGAIN SHOWED A DEEPENED DEPRESSION IN THE OUTER ANGLE OF HIS BUSHYEYEBROWS WHICH GAVE HIS FACE A PECULIAR MILDNESS PARDON THESE DETAILSFOR ONCEYOU WOULD HAVE LEARNED TO LOVE THEM IF YOU HAD KNOWN CALEBGARTH AND SAID IN A COMFORTABLE TONEIT WAS A MISFORTUNE EH THAT BREAKING THE HORSES KNEES
 AND THENTHESE EXCHANGES THEY DONT ANSWER WHEN YOU HAVE CUTE JOCKEYS TO DEALWITH
 YOULL BE WISER ANOTHER TIME MY BOY
WHEREUPON CALEB DREW DOWN HIS SPECTACLES AND PROCEEDED TO WRITE HISSIGNATURE WITH THE CARE WHICH HE ALWAYS GAVE TO THAT PERFORMANCE FORWHATEVER HE DID IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS HE DID WELL
 HE CONTEMPLATED THELARGE WELLPROPORTIONED LETTERS AND FINAL FLOURISH WITH HIS HEAD ATRIFLE ON ONE SIDE FOR AN INSTANT THEN HANDED IT TO FRED SAIDGOODBY AND RETURNED FORTHWITH TO HIS ABSORPTION IN A PLAN FOR SIRJAMES CHETTAMS NEW FARMBUILDINGS
EITHER BECAUSE HIS INTEREST IN THIS WORK THRUST THE INCIDENT OF THESIGNATURE FROM HIS MEMORY OR FOR SOME REASON OF WHICH CALEB WAS MORECONSCIOUS MRS
 GARTH REMAINED IGNORANT OF THE AFFAIR
SINCE IT OCCURRED A CHANGE HAD COME OVER FREDS SKY WHICH ALTERED HISVIEW OF THE DISTANCE AND WAS THE REASON WHY HIS UNCLE FEATHERSTONESPRESENT OF MONEY WAS OF IMPORTANCE ENOUGH TO MAKE HIS COLOR COME ANDGO FIRST WITH A TOO DEFINITE EXPECTATION AND AFTERWARDS WITH APROPORTIONATE DISAPPOINTMENT
 HIS FAILURE IN PASSING HIS EXAMINATIONHAD MADE HIS ACCUMULATION OF COLLEGE DEBTS THE MORE UNPARDONABLE BY HISFATHER AND THERE HAD BEEN AN UNPRECEDENTED STORM AT HOME
 MR
 VINCYHAD SWORN THAT IF HE HAD ANYTHING MORE OF THAT SORT TO PUT UP WITHFRED SHOULD TURN OUT AND GET HIS LIVING HOW HE COULD AND HE HAD NEVERYET QUITE RECOVERED HIS GOODHUMORED TONE TO HIS SON WHO HADESPECIALLY ENRAGED HIM BY SAYING AT THIS STAGE OF THINGS THAT HE DIDNOT WANT TO BE A CLERGYMAN AND WOULD RATHER NOT GO ON WITH THAT
FRED WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN YET MORE SEVERELY DEALT WITHIF HIS FAMILY AS WELL AS HIMSELF HAD NOT SECRETLY REGARDED HIM AS MR
FEATHERSTONES HEIR THAT OLD GENTLEMANS PRIDE IN HIM AND APPARENTFONDNESS FOR HIM SERVING IN THE STEAD OF MORE EXEMPLARY CONDUCTJUSTAS WHEN A YOUTHFUL NOBLEMAN STEALS JEWELLERY WE CALL THE ACTKLEPTOMANIA SPEAK OF IT WITH A PHILOSOPHICAL SMILE AND NEVER THINK OFHIS BEING SENT TO THE HOUSE OF CORRECTION AS IF HE WERE A RAGGED BOYWHO HAD STOLEN TURNIPS
 IN FACT TACIT EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT WOULD BEDONE FOR HIM BY UNCLE FEATHERSTONE DETERMINED THE ANGLE AT WHICH MOSTPEOPLE VIEWED FRED VINCY IN MIDDLEMARCH AND IN HIS OWN CONSCIOUSNESSWHAT UNCLE FEATHERSTONE WOULD DO FOR HIM IN AN EMERGENCY OR WHAT HEWOULD DO SIMPLY AS AN INCORPORATED LUCK FORMED ALWAYS AN IMMEASURABLEDEPTH OF AERIAL PERSPECTIVE
 BUT THAT PRESENT OF BANKNOTES ONCE MADEWAS MEASURABLE AND BEING APPLIED TO THE AMOUNT OF THE DEBT SHOWED ADEFICIT WHICH HAD STILL TO BE FILLED UP EITHER BY FREDS JUDGMENT ORBY LUCK IN SOME OTHER SHAPE
 FOR THAT LITTLE EPISODE OF THE ALLEGEDBORROWING IN WHICH HE HAD MADE HIS FATHER THE AGENT IN GETTING THEBULSTRODE CERTIFICATE WAS A NEW REASON AGAINST GOING TO HIS FATHER FORMONEY TOWARDS MEETING HIS ACTUAL DEBT
 FRED WAS KEEN ENOUGH TO FORESEETHAT ANGER WOULD CONFUSE DISTINCTIONS AND THAT HIS DENIAL OF HAVINGBORROWED EXPRESSLY ON THE STRENGTH OF HIS UNCLES WILL WOULD BE TAKENAS A FALSEHOOD
 HE HAD GONE TO HIS FATHER AND TOLD HIM ONE VEXATIOUSAFFAIR AND HE HAD LEFT ANOTHER UNTOLD IN SUCH CASES THE COMPLETEREVELATION ALWAYS PRODUCES THE IMPRESSION OF A PREVIOUS DUPLICITY
 NOWFRED PIQUED HIMSELF ON KEEPING CLEAR OF LIES AND EVEN FIBS HE OFTENSHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GRIMACE AT WHAT HE CALLEDROSAMONDS FIBS IT IS ONLY BROTHERS WHO CAN ASSOCIATE SUCH IDEAS WITHA LOVELY GIRL AND RATHER THAN INCUR THE ACCUSATION OF FALSEHOOD HEWOULD EVEN INCUR SOME TROUBLE AND SELFRESTRAINT
 IT WAS UNDER STRONGINWARD PRESSURE OF THIS KIND THAT FRED HAD TAKEN THE WISE STEP OFDEPOSITING THE EIGHTY POUNDS WITH HIS MOTHER
 IT WAS A PITY THAT HE HADNOT AT ONCE GIVEN THEM TO MR
 GARTH BUT HE MEANT TO MAKE THE SUMCOMPLETE WITH ANOTHER SIXTY AND WITH A VIEW TO THIS HE HAD KEPTTWENTY POUNDS IN HIS OWN POCKET AS A SORT OF SEEDCORN WHICH PLANTEDBY JUDGMENT AND WATERED BY LUCK MIGHT YIELD MORE THAN THREEFOLDAVERY POOR RATE OF MULTIPLICATION WHEN THE FIELD IS A YOUNG GENTLEMANSINFINITE SOUL WITH ALL THE NUMERALS AT COMMAND
FRED WAS NOT A GAMBLER HE HAD NOT THAT SPECIFIC DISEASE IN WHICH THESUSPENSION OF THE WHOLE NERVOUS ENERGY ON A CHANCE OR RISK BECOMES ASNECESSARY AS THE DRAM TO THE DRUNKARD HE HAD ONLY THE TENDENCY TO THATDIFFUSIVE FORM OF GAMBLING WHICH HAS NO ALCOHOLIC INTENSITY BUT ISCARRIED ON WITH THE HEALTHIEST CHYLEFED BLOOD KEEPING UP A JOYOUSIMAGINATIVE ACTIVITY WHICH FASHIONS EVENTS ACCORDING TO DESIRE ANDHAVING NO FEARS ABOUT ITS OWN WEATHER ONLY SEES THE ADVANTAGE THEREMUST BE TO OTHERS IN GOING ABOARD WITH IT
 HOPEFULNESS HAS A PLEASUREIN MAKING A THROW OF ANY KIND BECAUSE THE PROSPECT OF SUCCESS ISCERTAIN AND ONLY A MORE GENEROUS PLEASURE IN OFFERING AS MANY ASPOSSIBLE A SHARE IN THE STAKE
 FRED LIKED PLAY ESPECIALLY BILLIARDSAS HE LIKED HUNTING OR RIDING A STEEPLECHASE AND HE ONLY LIKED IT THEBETTER BECAUSE HE WANTED MONEY AND HOPED TO WIN
 BUT THE TWENTY POUNDSWORTH OF SEEDCORN HAD BEEN PLANTED IN VAIN IN THE SEDUCTIVE GREENPLOTALL OF IT AT LEAST WHICH HAD NOT BEEN DISPERSED BY THEROADSIDEAND FRED FOUND HIMSELF CLOSE UPON THE TERM OF PAYMENT WITH NOMONEY AT COMMAND BEYOND THE EIGHTY POUNDS WHICH HE HAD DEPOSITED WITHHIS MOTHER
 THE BROKENWINDED HORSE WHICH HE RODE REPRESENTED A PRESENTWHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO HIM A LONG WHILE AGO BY HIS UNCLE FEATHERSTONEHIS FATHER ALWAYS ALLOWED HIM TO KEEP A HORSE MR
 VINCYS OWN HABITSMAKING HIM REGARD THIS AS A REASONABLE DEMAND EVEN FOR A SON WHO WASRATHER EXASPERATING
 THIS HORSE THEN WAS FREDS PROPERTY AND IN HISANXIETY TO MEET THE IMMINENT BILL HE DETERMINED TO SACRIFICE APOSSESSION WITHOUT WHICH LIFE WOULD CERTAINLY BE WORTH LITTLE
 HE MADETHE RESOLUTION WITH A SENSE OF HEROISMHEROISM FORCED ON HIM BY THEDREAD OF BREAKING HIS WORD TO MR
 GARTH BY HIS LOVE FOR MARY AND AWEOF HER OPINION
 HE WOULD START FOR HOUNDSLEY HORSEFAIR WHICH WAS TO BEHELD THE NEXT MORNING ANDSIMPLY SELL HIS HORSE BRINGING BACK THEMONEY BY COACH
WELL THE HORSE WOULD HARDLY FETCH MORE THAN THIRTYPOUNDS AND THERE WAS NO KNOWING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IT WOULD BE FOLLYTO BALK HIMSELF OF LUCK BEFOREHAND
 IT WAS A HUNDRED TO ONE THAT SOMEGOOD CHANCE WOULD FALL IN HIS WAY THE LONGER HE THOUGHT OF IT THELESS POSSIBLE IT SEEMED THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE A GOOD CHANCE AND THELESS REASONABLE THAT HE SHOULD NOT EQUIP HIMSELF WITH THE POWDER ANDSHOT FOR BRINGING IT DOWN
 HE WOULD RIDE TO HOUNDSLEY WITH BAMBRIDGEAND WITH HORROCK THE VET AND WITHOUT ASKING THEM ANYTHING EXPRESSLYHE SHOULD VIRTUALLY GET THE BENEFIT OF THEIR OPINION
 BEFORE HE SETOUT FRED GOT THE EIGHTY POUNDS FROM HIS MOTHER
MOST OF THOSE WHO SAW FRED RIDING OUT OF MIDDLEMARCH IN COMPANY WITHBAMBRIDGE AND HORROCK ON HIS WAY OF COURSE TO HOUNDSLEY HORSEFAIRTHOUGHT THAT YOUNG VINCY WAS PLEASURESEEKING AS USUAL AND BUT FOR ANUNWONTED CONSCIOUSNESS OF GRAVE MATTERS ON HAND HE HIMSELF WOULD HAVEHAD A SENSE OF DISSIPATION AND OF DOING WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED OF AGAY YOUNG FELLOW
 CONSIDERING THAT FRED WAS NOT AT ALL COARSE THAT HERATHER LOOKED DOWN ON THE MANNERS AND SPEECH OF YOUNG MEN WHO HAD NOTBEEN TO THE UNIVERSITY AND THAT HE HAD WRITTEN STANZAS AS PASTORAL ANDUNVOLUPTUOUS AS HIS FLUTEPLAYING HIS ATTRACTION TOWARDS BAMBRIDGE ANDHORROCK WAS AN INTERESTING FACT WHICH EVEN THE LOVE OF HORSEFLESHWOULD NOT WHOLLY ACCOUNT FOR WITHOUT THAT MYSTERIOUS INFLUENCE OFNAMING WHICH DETERMINATES SO MUCH OF MORTAL CHOICE
 UNDER ANY OTHERNAME THAN PLEASURE THE SOCIETY OF MESSIEURS BAMBRIDGE AND HORROCKMUST CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS MONOTONOUS AND TO ARRIVE WITHTHEM AT HOUNDSLEY ON A DRIZZLING AFTERNOON TO GET DOWN AT THE RED LIONIN A STREET SHADED WITH COALDUST AND DINE IN A ROOM FURNISHED WITH ADIRTENAMELLED MAP OF THE COUNTY A BAD PORTRAIT OF AN ANONYMOUS HORSEIN A STABLE HIS MAJESTY GEORGE THE FOURTH WITH LEGS AND CRAVAT ANDVARIOUS LEADEN SPITTOONS MIGHT HAVE SEEMED A HARD BUSINESS BUT FORTHE SUSTAINING POWER OF NOMENCLATURE WHICH DETERMINED THAT THE PURSUITOF THESE THINGS WAS GAY
IN MR
 HORROCK THERE WAS CERTAINLY AN APPARENT UNFATHOMABLENESS WHICHOFFERED PLAY TO THE IMAGINATION
 COSTUME AT A GLANCE GAVE HIM ATHRILLING ASSOCIATION WITH HORSES ENOUGH TO SPECIFY THE HATBRIM WHICHTOOK THE SLIGHTEST UPWARD ANGLE JUST TO ESCAPE THE SUSPICION OF BENDINGDOWNWARDS AND NATURE HAD GIVEN HIM A FACE WHICH BY DINT OF MONGOLIANEYES AND A NOSE MOUTH AND CHIN SEEMING TO FOLLOW HIS HATBRIM IN AMODERATE INCLINATION UPWARDS GAVE THE EFFECT OF A SUBDUED UNCHANGEABLESCEPTICAL SMILE OF ALL EXPRESSIONS THE MOST TYRANNOUS OVER ASUSCEPTIBLE MIND AND WHEN ACCOMPANIED BY ADEQUATE SILENCE LIKELY TOCREATE THE REPUTATION OF AN INVINCIBLE UNDERSTANDING AN INFINITE FUNDOF HUMORTOO DRY TO FLOW AND PROBABLY IN A STATE OF IMMOVABLECRUSTAND A CRITICAL JUDGMENT WHICH IF YOU COULD EVER BE FORTUNATEENOUGH TO KNOW IT WOULD BE THE THING AND NO OTHER
 IT IS APHYSIOGNOMY SEEN IN ALL VOCATIONS BUT PERHAPS IT HAS NEVER BEEN MOREPOWERFUL OVER THE YOUTH OF ENGLAND THAN IN A JUDGE OF HORSES
MR
 HORROCK AT A QUESTION FROM FRED ABOUT HIS HORSES FETLOCK TURNEDSIDEWAYS IN HIS SADDLE AND WATCHED THE HORSES ACTION FOR THE SPACE OFTHREE MINUTES THEN TURNED FORWARD TWITCHED HIS OWN BRIDLE ANDREMAINED SILENT WITH A PROFILE NEITHER MORE NOR LESS SCEPTICAL THAN ITHAD BEEN
THE PART THUS PLAYED IN DIALOGUE BY MR
 HORROCK WAS TERRIBLY EFFECTIVE
A MIXTURE OF PASSIONS WAS EXCITED IN FREDA MAD DESIRE TO THRASHHORROCKS OPINION INTO UTTERANCE RESTRAINED BY ANXIETY TO RETAIN THEADVANTAGE OF HIS FRIENDSHIP
 THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT HORROCKMIGHT SAY SOMETHING QUITE INVALUABLE AT THE RIGHT MOMENT
MR
 BAMBRIDGE HAD MORE OPEN MANNERS AND APPEARED TO GIVE FORTH HISIDEAS WITHOUT ECONOMY
 HE WAS LOUD ROBUST AND WAS SOMETIMES SPOKEN OFAS BEING GIVEN TO INDULGENCECHIEFLY IN SWEARING DRINKING ANDBEATING HIS WIFE
 SOME PEOPLE WHO HAD LOST BY HIM CALLED HIM A VICIOUSMAN BUT HE REGARDED HORSEDEALING AS THE FINEST OF THE ARTS AND MIGHTHAVE ARGUED PLAUSIBLY THAT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MORALITY
 HE WASUNDENIABLY A PROSPEROUS MAN BORE HIS DRINKING BETTER THAN OTHERS BORETHEIR MODERATION AND ON THE WHOLE FLOURISHED LIKE THE GREENBAYTREE
 BUT HIS RANGE OF CONVERSATION WAS LIMITED AND LIKE THE FINEOLD TUNE DROPS OF BRANDY GAVE YOU AFTER A WHILE A SENSE OFRETURNING UPON ITSELF IN A WAY THAT MIGHT MAKE WEAK HEADS DIZZY
 BUT ASLIGHT INFUSION OF MR
 BAMBRIDGE WAS FELT TO GIVE TONE AND CHARACTER TOSEVERAL CIRCLES IN MIDDLEMARCH AND HE WAS A DISTINGUISHED FIGURE INTHE BAR AND BILLIARDROOM AT THE GREEN DRAGON
 HE KNEW SOME ANECDOTESABOUT THE HEROES OF THE TURF AND VARIOUS CLEVER TRICKS OF MARQUESSESAND VISCOUNTS WHICH SEEMED TO PROVE THAT BLOOD ASSERTED ITSPREEMINENCE EVEN AMONG BLACKLEGS BUT THE MINUTE RETENTIVENESS OF HISMEMORY WAS CHIEFLY SHOWN ABOUT THE HORSES HE HAD HIMSELF BOUGHT ANDSOLD THE NUMBER OF MILES THEY WOULD TROT YOU IN NO TIME WITHOUTTURNING A HAIR BEING AFTER THE LAPSE OF YEARS STILL A SUBJECT OFPASSIONATE ASSEVERATION IN WHICH HE WOULD ASSIST THE IMAGINATION OFHIS HEARERS BY SOLEMNLY SWEARING THAT THEY NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT
IN SHORT MR
 BAMBRIDGE WAS A MAN OF PLEASURE AND A GAY COMPANION
FRED WAS SUBTLE AND DID NOT TELL HIS FRIENDS THAT HE WAS GOING TOHOUNDSLEY BENT ON SELLING HIS HORSE HE WISHED TO GET INDIRECTLY ATTHEIR GENUINE OPINION OF ITS VALUE NOT BEING AWARE THAT A GENUINEOPINION WAS THE LAST THING LIKELY TO BE EXTRACTED FROM SUCH EMINENTCRITICS
 IT WAS NOT MR
 BAMBRIDGES WEAKNESS TO BE A GRATUITOUSFLATTERER
 HE HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN SO MUCH STRUCK WITH THE FACT THATTHIS UNFORTUNATE BAY WAS A ROARER TO A DEGREE WHICH REQUIRED THEROUNDEST WORD FOR PERDITION TO GIVE YOU ANY IDEA OF IT
YOU MADE A BAD HAND AT SWAPPING WHEN YOU WENT TO ANYBODY BUT MEVINCY
 WHY YOU NEVER THREW YOUR LEG ACROSS A FINER HORSE THAN THATCHESTNUT AND YOU GAVE HIM FOR THIS BRUTE
 IF YOU SET HIM CANTERING HEGOES ON LIKE TWENTY SAWYERS
 I NEVER HEARD BUT ONE WORSE ROARER IN MYLIFE AND THAT WAS A ROAN IT BELONGED TO PEGWELL THE CORNFACTOR HEUSED TO DRIVE HIM IN HIS GIG SEVEN YEARS AGO AND HE WANTED ME TO TAKEHIM BUT I SAID THANK YOU PEG I DONT DEAL IN WINDINSTRUMENTS
THAT WAS WHAT I SAID
 IT WENT THE ROUND OF THE COUNTRY THAT JOKE DID
BUT WHAT THE HELL
 THE HORSE WAS A PENNY TRUMPET TO THAT ROARER OFYOURS
WHY YOU SAID JUST NOW HIS WAS WORSE THAN MINE SAID FRED MOREIRRITABLE THAN USUAL
I SAID A LIE THEN SAID MR
 BAMBRIDGE EMPHATICALLY
 THERE WASNT APENNY TO CHOOSE BETWEEN EM
FRED SPURRED HIS HORSE AND THEY TROTTED ON A LITTLE WAY
 WHEN THEYSLACKENED AGAIN MR
 BAMBRIDGE SAIDNOT BUT WHAT THE ROAN WAS A BETTER TROTTER THAN YOURS
IM QUITE SATISFIED WITH HIS PACES I KNOW SAID FRED WHO REQUIREDALL THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING IN GAY COMPANY TO SUPPORT HIM I SAYHIS TROT IS AN UNCOMMONLY CLEAN ONE EH HORROCK
MR
 HORROCK LOOKED BEFORE HIM WITH AS COMPLETE A NEUTRALITY AS IF HEHAD BEEN A PORTRAIT BY A GREAT MASTER
FRED GAVE UP THE FALLACIOUS HOPE OF GETTING A GENUINE OPINION BUT ONREFLECTION HE SAW THAT BAMBRIDGES DEPRECIATION AND HORROCKS SILENCEWERE BOTH VIRTUALLY ENCOURAGING AND INDICATED THAT THEY THOUGHT BETTEROF THE HORSE THAN THEY CHOSE TO SAY
THAT VERY EVENING INDEED BEFORE THE FAIR HAD SET IN FRED THOUGHT HESAW A FAVORABLE OPENING FOR DISPOSING ADVANTAGEOUSLY OF HIS HORSE BUTAN OPENING WHICH MADE HIM CONGRATULATE HIMSELF ON HIS FORESIGHT INBRINGING WITH HIM HIS EIGHTY POUNDS
 A YOUNG FARMER ACQUAINTED WITHMR
 BAMBRIDGE CAME INTO THE RED LION AND ENTERED INTO CONVERSATIONABOUT PARTING WITH A HUNTER WHICH HE INTRODUCED AT ONCE AS DIAMONDIMPLYING THAT IT WAS A PUBLIC CHARACTER
 FOR HIMSELF HE ONLY WANTED AUSEFUL HACK WHICH WOULD DRAW UPON OCCASION BEING ABOUT TO MARRY ANDTO GIVE UP HUNTING
 THE HUNTER WAS IN A FRIENDS STABLE AT SOME LITTLEDISTANCE THERE WAS STILL TIME FOR GENTLEMEN TO SEE IT BEFORE DARK
 THEFRIENDS STABLE HAD TO BE REACHED THROUGH A BACK STREET WHERE YOU MIGHTAS EASILY HAVE BEEN POISONED WITHOUT EXPENSE OF DRUGS AS IN ANY GRIMSTREET OF THAT UNSANITARY PERIOD
 FRED WAS NOT FORTIFIED AGAINSTDISGUST BY BRANDY AS HIS COMPANIONS WERE BUT THE HOPE OF HAVING ATLAST SEEN THE HORSE THAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO MAKE MONEY WASEXHILARATING ENOUGH TO LEAD HIM OVER THE SAME GROUND AGAIN THE FIRSTTHING IN THE MORNING
 HE FELT SURE THAT IF HE DID NOT COME TO A BARGAINWITH THE FARMER BAMBRIDGE WOULD FOR THE STRESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES FREDFELT WAS SHARPENING HIS ACUTENESS AND ENDOWING HIM WITH ALL THECONSTRUCTIVE POWER OF SUSPICION
 BAMBRIDGE HAD RUN DOWN DIAMOND IN AWAY THAT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE THE HORSE BEING A FRIENDS IF HEHAD NOT THOUGHT OF BUYING IT EVERY ONE WHO LOOKED AT THE ANIMALEVENHORROCKWAS EVIDENTLY IMPRESSED WITH ITS MERIT
 TO GET ALL THEADVANTAGE OF BEING WITH MEN OF THIS SORT YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO DRAWYOUR INFERENCES AND NOT BE A SPOON WHO TAKES THINGS LITERALLY
 THECOLOR OF THE HORSE WAS A DAPPLED GRAY AND FRED HAPPENED TO KNOW THATLORD MEDLICOTES MAN WAS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR JUST SUCH A HORSE
 AFTERALL HIS RUNNING DOWN BAMBRIDGE LET IT OUT IN THE COURSE OF THEEVENING WHEN THE FARMER WAS ABSENT THAT HE HAD SEEN WORSE HORSES GOFOR EIGHTY POUNDS
 OF COURSE HE CONTRADICTED HIMSELF TWENTY TIMES OVERBUT WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT IS LIKELY TO BE TRUE YOU CAN TEST A MANSADMISSIONS
 AND FRED COULD NOT BUT RECKON HIS OWN JUDGMENT OF A HORSEAS WORTH SOMETHING
 THE FARMER HAD PAUSED OVER FREDS RESPECTABLETHOUGH BROKENWINDED STEED LONG ENOUGH TO SHOW THAT HE THOUGHT IT WORTHCONSIDERATION AND IT SEEMED PROBABLE THAT HE WOULD TAKE IT WITHFIVEANDTWENTY POUNDS IN ADDITION AS THE EQUIVALENT OF DIAMOND
 INTHAT CASE FRED WHEN HE HAD PARTED WITH HIS NEW HORSE FOR AT LEASTEIGHTY POUNDS WOULD BE FIFTYFIVE POUNDS IN POCKET BY THE TRANSACTIONAND WOULD HAVE A HUNDRED AND THIRTYFIVE POUNDS TOWARDS MEETING THEBILL SO THAT THE DEFICIT TEMPORARILY THROWN ON MR
 GARTH WOULD AT THEUTMOST BE TWENTYFIVE POUNDS
 BY THE TIME HE WAS HURRYING ON HISCLOTHES IN THE MORNING HE SAW SO CLEARLY THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT LOSINGTHIS RARE CHANCE THAT IF BAMBRIDGE AND HORROCK HAD BOTH DISSUADED HIMHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DELUDED INTO A DIRECT INTERPRETATION OF THEIRPURPOSE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE THAT THOSE DEEP HANDS HELD SOMETHINGELSE THAN A YOUNG FELLOWS INTEREST
 WITH REGARD TO HORSES DISTRUSTWAS YOUR ONLY CLEW
 BUT SCEPTICISM AS WE KNOW CAN NEVER BE THOROUGHLYAPPLIED ELSE LIFE WOULD COME TO A STANDSTILL SOMETHING WE MUSTBELIEVE IN AND DO AND WHATEVER THAT SOMETHING MAY BE CALLED IT ISVIRTUALLY OUR OWN JUDGMENT EVEN WHEN IT SEEMS LIKE THE MOST SLAVISHRELIANCE ON ANOTHER
 FRED BELIEVED IN THE EXCELLENCE OF HIS BARGAINAND EVEN BEFORE THE FAIR HAD WELL SET IN HAD GOT POSSESSION OF THEDAPPLED GRAY AT THE PRICE OF HIS OLD HORSE AND THIRTY POUNDS INADDITIONONLY FIVE POUNDS MORE THAN HE HAD EXPECTED TO GIVE
BUT HE FELT A LITTLE WORRIED AND WEARIED PERHAPS WITH MENTAL DEBATEAND WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE FURTHER GAYETIES OF THE HORSEFAIR HE SETOUT ALONE ON HIS FOURTEEN MILES JOURNEY MEANING TO TAKE IT VERYQUIETLY AND KEEP HIS HORSE FRESH
CHAPTER XXIV
THE OFFENDERS SORROW BRINGS BUT SMALL RELIEFTO HIM WHO WEARS THE STRONG OFFENCES CROSS
SHAKESPEARE SONNETS
I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT ONLY THE THIRD DAY AFTER THE PROPITIOUS EVENTSAT HOUNDSLEY FRED VINCY HAD FALLEN INTO WORSE SPIRITS THAN HE HAD KNOWNIN HIS LIFE BEFORE
 NOT THAT HE HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED AS TO THEPOSSIBLE MARKET FOR HIS HORSE BUT THAT BEFORE THE BARGAIN COULD BECONCLUDED WITH LORD MEDLICOTES MAN THIS DIAMOND IN WHICH HOPE TO THEAMOUNT OF EIGHTY POUNDS HAD BEEN INVESTED HAD WITHOUT THE SLIGHTESTWARNING EXHIBITED IN THE STABLE A MOST VICIOUS ENERGY IN KICKING HADJUST MISSED KILLING THE GROOM AND HAD ENDED IN LAMING HIMSELF SEVERELYBY CATCHING HIS LEG IN A ROPE THAT OVERHUNG THE STABLEBOARD
 THERE WASNO MORE REDRESS FOR THIS THAN FOR THE DISCOVERY OF BAD TEMPER AFTERMARRIAGEWHICH OF COURSE OLD COMPANIONS WERE AWARE OF BEFORE THECEREMONY
 FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER FRED HAD NONE OF HIS USUALELASTICITY UNDER THIS STROKE OF ILLFORTUNE HE WAS SIMPLY AWARE THATHE HAD ONLY FIFTY POUNDS THAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIS GETTING ANYMORE AT PRESENT AND THAT THE BILL FOR A HUNDRED AND SIXTY WOULD BEPRESENTED IN FIVE DAYS
 EVEN IF HE HAD APPLIED TO HIS FATHER ON THEPLEA THAT MR
 GARTH SHOULD BE SAVED FROM LOSS FRED FELT SMARTINGLYTHAT HIS FATHER WOULD ANGRILY REFUSE TO RESCUE MR
 GARTH FROM THECONSEQUENCE OF WHAT HE WOULD CALL ENCOURAGING EXTRAVAGANCE AND DECEIT
HE WAS SO UTTERLY DOWNCAST THAT HE COULD FRAME NO OTHER PROJECT THAN TOGO STRAIGHT TO MR
 GARTH AND TELL HIM THE SAD TRUTH CARRYING WITH HIMTHE FIFTY POUNDS AND GETTING THAT SUM AT LEAST SAFELY OUT OF HIS OWNHANDS
 HIS FATHER BEING AT THE WAREHOUSE DID NOT YET KNOW OF THEACCIDENT WHEN HE DID HE WOULD STORM ABOUT THE VICIOUS BRUTE BEINGBROUGHT INTO HIS STABLE AND BEFORE MEETING THAT LESSER ANNOYANCE FREDWANTED TO GET AWAY WITH ALL HIS COURAGE TO FACE THE GREATER
 HE TOOKHIS FATHERS NAG FOR HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT WHEN HE HAD TOLD MR
GARTH HE WOULD RIDE TO STONE COURT AND CONFESS ALL TO MARY
 IN FACTIT IS PROBABLE THAT BUT FOR MARYS EXISTENCE AND FREDS LOVE FOR HERHIS CONSCIENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH LESS ACTIVE BOTH IN PREVIOUSLYURGING THE DEBT ON HIS THOUGHT AND IMPELLING HIM NOT TO SPARE HIMSELFAFTER HIS USUAL FASHION BY DEFERRING AN UNPLEASANT TASK BUT TO ACT ASDIRECTLY AND SIMPLY AS HE COULD
 EVEN MUCH STRONGER MORTALS THAN FREDVINCY HOLD HALF THEIR RECTITUDE IN THE MIND OF THE BEING THEY LOVEBEST
 THE THEATRE OF ALL MY ACTIONS IS FALLEN SAID AN ANTIQUEPERSONAGE WHEN HIS CHIEF FRIEND WAS DEAD AND THEY ARE FORTUNATE WHOGET A THEATRE WHERE THE AUDIENCE DEMANDS THEIR BEST
 CERTAINLY IT WOULDHAVE MADE A CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE TO FRED AT THAT TIME IF MARY GARTHHAD HAD NO DECIDED NOTIONS AS TO WHAT WAS ADMIRABLE IN CHARACTER
MR
 GARTH WAS NOT AT THE OFFICE AND FRED RODE ON TO HIS HOUSE WHICHWAS A LITTLE WAY OUTSIDE THE TOWNA HOMELY PLACE WITH AN ORCHARD INFRONT OF IT A RAMBLING OLDFASHIONED HALFTIMBERED BUILDING WHICHBEFORE THE TOWN HAD SPREAD HAD BEEN A FARMHOUSE BUT WAS NOWSURROUNDED WITH THE PRIVATE GARDENS OF THE TOWNSMEN
 WE GET THE FONDEROF OUR HOUSES IF THEY HAVE A PHYSIOGNOMY OF THEIR OWN AS OUR FRIENDSHAVE
 THE GARTH FAMILY WHICH WAS RATHER A LARGE ONE FOR MARY HAD FOURBROTHERS AND ONE SISTER WERE VERY FOND OF THEIR OLD HOUSE FROM WHICHALL THE BEST FURNITURE HAD LONG BEEN SOLD
 FRED LIKED IT TOO KNOWINGIT BY HEART EVEN TO THE ATTIC WHICH SMELT DELICIOUSLY OF APPLES ANDQUINCES AND UNTIL TODAY HE HAD NEVER COME TO IT WITHOUT PLEASANTEXPECTATIONS BUT HIS HEART BEAT UNEASILY NOW WITH THE SENSE THAT HESHOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO MAKE HIS CONFESSION BEFORE MRS
 GARTH OF WHOMHE WAS RATHER MORE IN AWE THAN OF HER HUSBAND
 NOT THAT SHE WASINCLINED TO SARCASM AND TO IMPULSIVE SALLIES AS MARY WAS
 IN HERPRESENT MATRONLY AGE AT LEAST MRS
 GARTH NEVER COMMITTED HERSELF BYOVERHASTY SPEECH HAVING AS SHE SAID BORNE THE YOKE IN HER YOUTHAND LEARNED SELFCONTROL
 SHE HAD THAT RARE SENSE WHICH DISCERNS WHATIS UNALTERABLE AND SUBMITS TO IT WITHOUT MURMURING
 ADORING HERHUSBANDS VIRTUES SHE HAD VERY EARLY MADE UP HER MIND TO HISINCAPACITY OF MINDING HIS OWN INTERESTS AND HAD MET THE CONSEQUENCESCHEERFULLY
 SHE HAD BEEN MAGNANIMOUS ENOUGH TO RENOUNCE ALL PRIDE INTEAPOTS OR CHILDRENS FRILLING AND HAD NEVER POURED ANY PATHETICCONFIDENCES INTO THE EARS OF HER FEMININE NEIGHBORS CONCERNING MR
GARTHS WANT OF PRUDENCE AND THE SUMS HE MIGHT HAVE HAD IF HE HAD BEENLIKE OTHER MEN
 HENCE THESE FAIR NEIGHBORS THOUGHT HER EITHER PROUD ORECCENTRIC AND SOMETIMES SPOKE OF HER TO THEIR HUSBANDS AS YOUR FINEMRS
 GARTH
 SHE WAS NOT WITHOUT HER CRITICISM OF THEM IN RETURN BEINGMORE ACCURATELY INSTRUCTED THAN MOST MATRONS IN MIDDLEMARCH ANDWHEREIS THE BLAMELESS WOMAN
APT TO BE A LITTLE SEVERE TOWARDS HER OWN SEXWHICH IN HER OPINION WAS FRAMED TO BE ENTIRELY SUBORDINATE
 ON THEOTHER HAND SHE WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY INDULGENT TOWARDS THE FAILINGSOF MEN AND WAS OFTEN HEARD TO SAY THAT THESE WERE NATURAL
 ALSO ITMUST BE ADMITTED THAT MRS
 GARTH WAS A TRIFLE TOO EMPHATIC IN HERRESISTANCE TO WHAT SHE HELD TO BE FOLLIES THE PASSAGE FROM GOVERNESSINTO HOUSEWIFE HAD WROUGHT ITSELF A LITTLE TOO STRONGLY INTO HERCONSCIOUSNESS AND SHE RARELY FORGOT THAT WHILE HER GRAMMAR AND ACCENTWERE ABOVE THE TOWN STANDARD SHE WORE A PLAIN CAP COOKED THE FAMILYDINNER AND DARNED ALL THE STOCKINGS
 SHE HAD SOMETIMES TAKEN PUPILS INA PERIPATETIC FASHION MAKING THEM FOLLOW HER ABOUT IN THE KITCHEN WITHTHEIR BOOK OR SLATE
 SHE THOUGHT IT GOOD FOR THEM TO SEE THAT SHE COULDMAKE AN EXCELLENT LATHER WHILE SHE CORRECTED THEIR BLUNDERS WITHOUTLOOKINGTHAT A WOMAN WITH HER SLEEVES TUCKED UP ABOVE HER ELBOWSMIGHT KNOW ALL ABOUT THE SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD OR THE TORRID ZONETHAT INSHORT SHE MIGHT POSSESS EDUCATION AND OTHER GOOD THINGS ENDING INTION AND WORTHY TO BE PRONOUNCED EMPHATICALLY WITHOUT BEING AUSELESS DOLL
 WHEN SHE MADE REMARKS TO THIS EDIFYING EFFECT SHE HAD AFIRM LITTLE FROWN ON HER BROW WHICH YET DID NOT HINDER HER FACE FROMLOOKING BENEVOLENT AND HER WORDS WHICH CAME FORTH LIKE A PROCESSIONWERE UTTERED IN A FERVID AGREEABLE CONTRALTO
 CERTAINLY THE EXEMPLARYMRS
 GARTH HAD HER DROLL ASPECTS BUT HER CHARACTER SUSTAINED HERODDITIES AS A VERY FINE WINE SUSTAINS A FLAVOR OF SKIN
TOWARDS FRED VINCY SHE HAD A MOTHERLY FEELING AND HAD ALWAYS BEENDISPOSED TO EXCUSE HIS ERRORS THOUGH SHE WOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVEEXCUSED MARY FOR ENGAGING HERSELF TO HIM HER DAUGHTER BEING INCLUDEDIN THAT MORE RIGOROUS JUDGMENT WHICH SHE APPLIED TO HER OWN SEX
 BUTTHIS VERY FACT OF HER EXCEPTIONAL INDULGENCE TOWARDS HIM MADE IT THEHARDER TO FRED THAT HE MUST NOW INEVITABLY SINK IN HER OPINION
 AND THECIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS VISIT TURNED OUT TO BE STILL MORE UNPLEASANT THANHE HAD EXPECTED FOR CALEB GARTH HAD GONE OUT EARLY TO LOOK AT SOMEREPAIRS NOT FAR OFF
 MRS
 GARTH AT CERTAIN HOURS WAS ALWAYS IN THEKITCHEN AND THIS MORNING SHE WAS CARRYING ON SEVERAL OCCUPATIONS ATONCE THEREMAKING HER PIES AT THE WELLSCOURED DEAL TABLE ON ONE SIDEOF THAT AIRY ROOM OBSERVING SALLYS MOVEMENTS AT THE OVEN ANDDOUGHTUB THROUGH AN OPEN DOOR AND GIVING LESSONS TO HER YOUNGEST BOYAND GIRL WHO WERE STANDING OPPOSITE TO HER AT THE TABLE WITH THEIRBOOKS AND SLATES BEFORE THEM
 A TUB AND A CLOTHESHORSE AT THE OTHEREND OF THE KITCHEN INDICATED AN INTERMITTENT WASH OF SMALL THINGS ALSOGOING ON
MRS
 GARTH WITH HER SLEEVES TURNED ABOVE HER ELBOWS DEFTLY HANDLINGHER PASTRYAPPLYING HER ROLLINGPIN AND GIVING ORNAMENTAL PINCHESWHILE SHE EXPOUNDED WITH GRAMMATICAL FERVOR WHAT WERE THE RIGHT VIEWSABOUT THE CONCORD OF VERBS AND PRONOUNS WITH NOUNS OF MULTITUDE ORSIGNIFYING MANY WAS A SIGHT AGREEABLY AMUSING
 SHE WAS OF THE SAMECURLYHAIRED SQUAREFACED TYPE AS MARY BUT HANDSOMER WITH MOREDELICACY OF FEATURE A PALE SKIN A SOLID MATRONLY FIGURE AND AREMARKABLE FIRMNESS OF GLANCE
 IN HER SNOWYFRILLED CAP SHE REMINDEDONE OF THAT DELIGHTFUL FRENCHWOMAN WHOM WE HAVE ALL SEEN MARKETINGBASKET ON ARM
 LOOKING AT THE MOTHER YOU MIGHT HOPE THAT THE DAUGHTERWOULD BECOME LIKE HER WHICH IS A PROSPECTIVE ADVANTAGE EQUAL TO ADOWRYTHE MOTHER TOO OFTEN STANDING BEHIND THE DAUGHTER LIKE AMALIGNANT PROPHECYSUCH AS I AM SHE WILL SHORTLY BE
NOW LET US GO THROUGH THAT ONCE MORE SAID MRS
 GARTH PINCHING ANAPPLEPUFF WHICH SEEMED TO DISTRACT BEN AN ENERGETIC YOUNG MALE WITH AHEAVY BROW FROM DUE ATTENTION TO THE LESSON
 NOT WITHOUT REGARD TOTHE IMPORT OF THE WORD AS CONVEYING UNITY OR PLURALITY OF IDEATELL MEAGAIN WHAT THAT MEANS BEN
MRS
 GARTH LIKE MORE CELEBRATED EDUCATORS HAD HER FAVORITE ANCIENTPATHS AND IN A GENERAL WRECK OF SOCIETY WOULD HAVE TRIED TO HOLD HERLINDLEY MURRAY ABOVE THE WAVES
OHIT MEANSYOU MUST THINK WHAT YOU MEAN SAID BEN RATHER PEEVISHLY
I HATE GRAMMAR
 WHATS THE USE OF IT
TO TEACH YOU TO SPEAK AND WRITE CORRECTLY SO THAT YOU CAN BEUNDERSTOOD SAID MRS
 GARTH WITH SEVERE PRECISION
 SHOULD YOU LIKETO SPEAK AS OLD JOB DOES
YES SAID BEN STOUTLY ITS FUNNIER
 HE SAYS YO GOOTHATS JUSTAS GOOD AS YOU GO
BUT HE SAYS A SHIPS IN THE GARDEN INSTEAD OF A SHEEP SAIDLETTY WITH AN AIR OF SUPERIORITY
 YOU MIGHT THINK HE MEANT A SHIP OFFTHE SEA
NO YOU MIGHTNT IF YOU WERENT SILLY SAID BEN
 HOW COULD A SHIPOFF THE SEA COME THERE
THESE THINGS BELONG ONLY TO PRONUNCIATION WHICH IS THE LEAST PART OFGRAMMAR SAID MRS
 GARTH
 THAT APPLEPEEL IS TO BE EATEN BY THE PIGSBEN IF YOU EAT IT I MUST GIVE THEM YOUR PIECE OF PASTY
 JOB HAS ONLYTO SPEAK ABOUT VERY PLAIN THINGS
 HOW DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD WRITE ORSPEAK ABOUT ANYTHING MORE DIFFICULT IF YOU KNEW NO MORE OF GRAMMARTHAN HE DOES
 YOU WOULD USE WRONG WORDS AND PUT WORDS IN THE WRONGPLACES AND INSTEAD OF MAKING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND YOU THEY WOULD TURNAWAY FROM YOU AS A TIRESOME PERSON
 WHAT WOULD YOU DO THEN
I SHOULDNT CARE I SHOULD LEAVE OFF SAID BEN WITH A SENSE THATTHIS WAS AN AGREEABLE ISSUE WHERE GRAMMAR WAS CONCERNED
I SEE YOU ARE GETTING TIRED AND STUPID BEN SAID MRS
 GARTHACCUSTOMED TO THESE OBSTRUCTIVE ARGUMENTS FROM HER MALE OFFSPRING
HAVING FINISHED HER PIES SHE MOVED TOWARDS THE CLOTHESHORSE ANDSAID COME HERE AND TELL ME THE STORY I TOLD YOU ON WEDNESDAY ABOUTCINCINNATUS

 WHEN YOUR BROTHER BEGAN YOU OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TO SEEIF HE COULD NOT TELL THE STORY
 HOW RUDE YOU LOOK PUSHING ANDFROWNING AS IF YOU WANTED TO CONQUER WITH YOUR ELBOWS
 CINCINNATUS IAM SURE WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER BEHAVE SO
 MRS
GARTH DELIVERED THIS AWFUL SENTENCE WITH MUCH MAJESTY OF ENUNCIATIONAND LETTY FELT THAT BETWEEN REPRESSED VOLUBILITY AND GENERAL DISESTEEMTHAT OF THE ROMANS INCLUSIVE LIFE WAS ALREADY A PAINFUL AFFAIR
 NOWBEN
WELLOHWELLWHY THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF FIGHTING AND THEY WEREALL BLOCKHEADS ANDI CANT TELL IT JUST HOW YOU TOLD ITBUT THEYWANTED A MAN TO BE CAPTAIN AND KING AND EVERYTHINGDICTATOR NOW SAID LETTY WITH INJURED LOOKS AND NOT WITHOUT A WISHTO MAKE HER MOTHER REPENT
VERY WELL DICTATOR
 SAID BEN CONTEMPTUOUSLY
 BUT THAT ISNT A GOODWORD HE DIDNT TELL THEM TO WRITE ON SLATES
COME COME BEN YOU ARE NOT SO IGNORANT AS THAT SAID MRS
 GARTHCAREFULLY SERIOUS
 HARK THERE IS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
 RUN LETTY ANDOPEN IT
THE KNOCK WAS FREDS AND WHEN LETTY SAID THAT HER FATHER WAS NOT INYET BUT THAT HER MOTHER WAS IN THE KITCHEN FRED HAD NO ALTERNATIVE
HE COULD NOT DEPART FROM HIS USUAL PRACTICE OF GOING TO SEE MRS
 GARTHIN THE KITCHEN IF SHE HAPPENED TO BE AT WORK THERE
 HE PUT HIS ARMROUND LETTYS NECK SILENTLY AND LED HER INTO THE KITCHEN WITHOUT HISUSUAL JOKES AND CARESSES
MRS
 GARTH WAS SURPRISED TO SEE FRED AT THIS HOUR BUT SURPRISE WAS NOTA FEELING THAT SHE WAS GIVEN TO EXPRESS AND SHE ONLY SAID QUIETLYCONTINUING HER WORKYOU FRED SO EARLY IN THE DAY
 YOU LOOK QUITE PALE
 HAS ANYTHINGHAPPENED
I WANT TO SPEAK TO MR
 GARTH SAID FRED NOT YET READY TO SAYMOREAND TO YOU ALSO HE ADDED AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE FOR HE HAD NODOUBT THAT MRS
 GARTH KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT THE BILL AND HE MUST INTHE END SPEAK OF IT BEFORE HER IF NOT TO HER SOLELY
CALEB WILL BE IN AGAIN IN A FEW MINUTES SAID MRS
 GARTH WHOIMAGINED SOME TROUBLE BETWEEN FRED AND HIS FATHER
 HE IS SURE NOT TOBE LONG BECAUSE HE HAS SOME WORK AT HIS DESK THAT MUST BE DONE THISMORNING
 DO YOU MIND STAYING WITH ME WHILE I FINISH MY MATTERS HERE
BUT WE NEEDNT GO ON ABOUT CINCINNATUS NEED WE
 SAID BEN WHO HADTAKEN FREDS WHIP OUT OF HIS HAND AND WAS TRYING ITS EFFICIENCY ON THECAT
NO GO OUT NOW
 BUT PUT THAT WHIP DOWN
 HOW VERY MEAN OF YOU TO WHIPPOOR OLD TORTOISE
 PRAY TAKE THE WHIP FROM HIM FRED
COME OLD BOY GIVE IT ME SAID FRED PUTTING OUT HIS HAND

NOT TODAYANOTHER TIME
 I AM NOT RIDING MY OWN HORSE

YES I THINK SO SAID FRED WITH AN UNPLEASANT TWINGE
TELL HER TO COME HOME SOON AND PLAY AT FORFEITS AND MAKE FUN
ENOUGH ENOUGH BEN
 RUN AWAY SAID MRS
 GARTH SEEING THAT FRED WASTEASED

 GARTH
 SAID FRED WHENTHE CHILDREN WERE GONE AND IT WAS NEEDFUL TO SAY SOMETHING THAT WOULDPASS THE TIME
 HE WAS NOT YET SURE WHETHER HE SHOULD WAIT FOR MR
GARTH OR USE ANY GOOD OPPORTUNITY IN CONVERSATION TO CONFESS TO MRS
GARTH HERSELF GIVE HER THE MONEY AND RIDE AWAY
ONEONLY ONE
 FANNY HACKBUTT COMES AT HALF PAST ELEVEN
 I AM NOTGETTING A GREAT INCOME NOW SAID MRS
 GARTH SMILING
 I AM AT A LOWEBB WITH PUPILS
 BUT I HAVE SAVED MY LITTLE PURSE FOR ALFREDS PREMIUMI HAVE NINETYTWO POUNDS
 HE CAN GO TO MR
 HANMERS NOW HE IS JUST ATTHE RIGHT AGE
THIS DID NOT LEAD WELL TOWARDS THE NEWS THAT MR
 GARTH WAS ON THE BRINKOF LOSING NINETYTWO POUNDS AND MORE
 FRED WAS SILENT
 YOUNG GENTLEMENWHO GO TO COLLEGE ARE RATHER MORE COSTLY THAN THAT MRS
 GARTHINNOCENTLY CONTINUED PULLING OUT THE EDGING ON A CAPBORDER
 ANDCALEB THINKS THAT ALFRED WILL TURN OUT A DISTINGUISHED ENGINEER HEWANTS TO GIVE THE BOY A GOOD CHANCE
 THERE HE IS
 I HEAR HIM COMING IN
WE WILL GO TO HIM IN THE PARLOR SHALL WE
WHEN THEY ENTERED THE PARLOR CALEB HAD THROWN DOWN HIS HAT AND WASSEATED AT HIS DESK
WHAT
 FRED MY BOY
 HE SAID IN A TONE OF MILD SURPRISE HOLDING HISPEN STILL UNDIPPED YOU ARE HERE BETIMES
 BUT MISSING THE USUALEXPRESSION OF CHEERFUL GREETING IN FREDS FACE HE IMMEDIATELY ADDEDIS THERE ANYTHING UP AT HOME
ANYTHING THE MATTER
YES MR
 GARTH I AM COME TO TELL SOMETHING THAT I AM AFRAID WILL GIVEYOU A BAD OPINION OF ME
 I AM COME TO TELL YOU AND MRS
 GARTH THAT ICANT KEEP MY WORD
 I CANT FIND THE MONEY TO MEET THE BILL AFTER ALL
I HAVE BEEN UNFORTUNATE I HAVE ONLY GOT THESE FIFTY POUNDS TOWARDS THEHUNDRED AND SIXTY
WHILE FRED WAS SPEAKING HE HAD TAKEN OUT THE NOTES AND LAID THEM ONTHE DESK BEFORE MR
 GARTH
 HE HAD BURST FORTH AT ONCE WITH THE PLAINFACT FEELING BOYISHLY MISERABLE AND WITHOUT VERBAL RESOURCES
 MRS
GARTH WAS MUTELY ASTONISHED AND LOOKED AT HER HUSBAND FOR ANEXPLANATION
 CALEB BLUSHED AND AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE SAIDOH I DIDNT TELL YOU SUSAN I PUT MY NAME TO A BILL FOR FRED IT WASFOR A HUNDRED AND SIXTY POUNDS
 HE MADE SURE HE COULD MEET IT HIMSELF
THERE WAS AN EVIDENT CHANGE IN MRS
 GARTHS FACE BUT IT WAS LIKE ACHANGE BELOW THE SURFACE OF WATER WHICH REMAINS SMOOTH
 SHE FIXED HEREYES ON FRED SAYINGI SUPPOSE YOU HAVE ASKED YOUR FATHER FOR THE REST OF THE MONEY AND HEHAS REFUSED YOU
NO SAID FRED BITING HIS LIP AND SPEAKING WITH MORE DIFFICULTYBUT I KNOW IT WILL BE OF NO USE TO ASK HIM AND UNLESS IT WERE OF USEI SHOULD NOT LIKE TO MENTION MR
 GARTHS NAME IN THE MATTER
IT HAS COME AT AN UNFORTUNATE TIME SAID CALEB IN HIS HESITATINGWAY LOOKING DOWN AT THE NOTES AND NERVOUSLY FINGERING THE PAPERCHRISTMAS UPON USIM RATHER HARD UP JUST NOW
 YOU SEE I HAVE TO CUTOUT EVERYTHING LIKE A TAILOR WITH SHORT MEASURE
 WHAT CAN WE DO SUSAN
I SHALL WANT EVERY FARTHING WE HAVE IN THE BANK
 ITS A HUNDRED AND TENPOUNDS THE DEUCE TAKE IT
I MUST GIVE YOU THE NINETYTWO POUNDS THAT I HAVE PUT BY FOR ALFREDSPREMIUM SAID MRS
 GARTH GRAVELY AND DECISIVELY THOUGH A NICE EARMIGHT HAVE DISCERNED A SLIGHT TREMOR IN SOME OF THE WORDS
 AND I HAVENO DOUBT THAT MARY HAS TWENTY POUNDS SAVED FROM HER SALARY BY THISTIME
 SHE WILL ADVANCE IT
MRS
 GARTH HAD NOT AGAIN LOOKED AT FRED AND WAS NOT IN THE LEASTCALCULATING WHAT WORDS SHE SHOULD USE TO CUT HIM THE MOST EFFECTIVELY
LIKE THE ECCENTRIC WOMAN SHE WAS SHE WAS AT PRESENT ABSORBED INCONSIDERING WHAT WAS TO BE DONE AND DID NOT FANCY THAT THE END COULDBE BETTER ACHIEVED BY BITTER REMARKS OR EXPLOSIONS
 BUT SHE HAD MADEFRED FEEL FOR THE FIRST TIME SOMETHING LIKE THE TOOTH OF REMORSE
CURIOUSLY ENOUGH HIS PAIN IN THE AFFAIR BEFOREHAND HAD CONSISTEDALMOST ENTIRELY IN THE SENSE THAT HE MUST SEEM DISHONORABLE AND SINKIN THE OPINION OF THE GARTHS HE HAD NOT OCCUPIED HIMSELF WITH THEINCONVENIENCE AND POSSIBLE INJURY THAT HIS BREACH MIGHT OCCASION THEMFOR THIS EXERCISE OF THE IMAGINATION ON OTHER PEOPLES NEEDS IS NOTCOMMON WITH HOPEFUL YOUNG GENTLEMEN
 INDEED WE ARE MOST OF US BROUGHTUP IN THE NOTION THAT THE HIGHEST MOTIVE FOR NOT DOING A WRONG ISSOMETHING IRRESPECTIVE OF THE BEINGS WHO WOULD SUFFER THE WRONG
 BUT ATTHIS MOMENT HE SUDDENLY SAW HIMSELF AS A PITIFUL RASCAL WHO WAS ROBBINGTWO WOMEN OF THEIR SAVINGS
I SHALL CERTAINLY PAY IT ALL MRS
 GARTHULTIMATELY HE STAMMEREDOUT
YES ULTIMATELY SAID MRS
 GARTH WHO HAVING A SPECIAL DISLIKE TOFINE WORDS ON UGLY OCCASIONS COULD NOT NOW REPRESS AN EPIGRAM
 BUTBOYS CANNOT WELL BE APPRENTICED ULTIMATELY THEY SHOULD BE APPRENTICEDAT FIFTEEN
 SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SO LITTLE INCLINED TO MAKE EXCUSES FORFRED
I WAS THE MOST IN THE WRONG SUSAN SAID CALEB
 FRED MADE SURE OFFINDING THE MONEY
 BUT ID NO BUSINESS TO BE FINGERING BILLS
 I SUPPOSEYOU HAVE LOOKED ALL ROUND AND TRIED ALL HONEST MEANS
 HE ADDED FIXINGHIS MERCIFUL GRAY EYES ON FRED
 CALEB WAS TOO DELICATE TO SPECIFY MR
FEATHERSTONE
YES I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHINGI REALLY HAVE
 I SHOULD HAVE HAD AHUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS READY BUT FOR A MISFORTUNE WITH A HORSE WHICHI WAS ABOUT TO SELL
 MY UNCLE HAD GIVEN ME EIGHTY POUNDS AND I PAIDAWAY THIRTY WITH MY OLD HORSE IN ORDER TO GET ANOTHER WHICH I WAS GOINGTO SELL FOR EIGHTY OR MOREI MEANT TO GO WITHOUT A HORSEBUT NOW IT HASTURNED OUT VICIOUS AND LAMED ITSELF
 I WISH I AND THE HORSES TOO HADBEEN AT THE DEVIL BEFORE I HAD BROUGHT THIS ON YOU
 THERES NO ONEELSE I CARE SO MUCH FOR YOU AND MRS
 GARTH HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO KIND TOME
 HOWEVER ITS NO USE SAYING THAT
 YOU WILL ALWAYS THINK ME A RASCALNOW
FRED TURNED ROUND AND HURRIED OUT OF THE ROOM CONSCIOUS THAT HE WASGETTING RATHER WOMANISH AND FEELING CONFUSEDLY THAT HIS BEING SORRYWAS NOT OF MUCH USE TO THE GARTHS
 THEY COULD SEE HIM MOUNT ANDQUICKLY PASS THROUGH THE GATE
I AM DISAPPOINTED IN FRED VINCY SAID MRS
 GARTH
 I WOULD NOT HAVEBELIEVED BEFOREHAND THAT HE WOULD HAVE DRAWN YOU INTO HIS DEBTS
 I KNEWHE WAS EXTRAVAGANT BUT I DID NOT THINK THAT HE WOULD BE SO MEAN AS TOHANG HIS RISKS ON HIS OLDEST FRIEND WHO COULD THE LEAST AFFORD TOLOSE
I WAS A FOOL SUSAN
THAT YOU WERE SAID THE WIFE NODDING AND SMILING
 BUT I SHOULD NOTHAVE GONE TO PUBLISH IT IN THE MARKETPLACE
 WHY SHOULD YOU KEEP SUCHTHINGS FROM ME
 IT IS JUST SO WITH YOUR BUTTONS YOU LET THEM BURST OFFWITHOUT TELLING ME AND GO OUT WITH YOUR WRISTBAND HANGING
 IF I HADONLY KNOWN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN READY WITH SOME BETTER PLAN
YOU ARE SADLY CUT UP I KNOW SUSAN SAID CALEB LOOKING FEELINGLY ATHER
 I CANT ABIDE YOUR LOSING THE MONEY YOUVE SCRAPED TOGETHER FORALFRED
IT IS VERY WELL THAT I HAD SCRAPED IT TOGETHER AND IT IS YOU WHOWILL HAVE TO SUFFER FOR YOU MUST TEACH THE BOY YOURSELF
 YOU MUST GIVEUP YOUR BAD HABITS
 SOME MEN TAKE TO DRINKING AND YOU HAVE TAKEN TOWORKING WITHOUT PAY
 YOU MUST INDULGE YOURSELF A LITTLE LESS IN THAT
AND YOU MUST RIDE OVER TO MARY AND ASK THE CHILD WHAT MONEY SHE HAS
CALEB HAD PUSHED HIS CHAIR BACK AND WAS LEANING FORWARD SHAKING HISHEAD SLOWLY AND FITTING HIS FINGERTIPS TOGETHER WITH MUCH NICETY
POOR MARY
 HE SAID
 SUSAN HE WENT ON IN A LOWERED TONE IMAFRAID SHE MAY BE FOND OF FRED
OH NO
 SHE ALWAYS LAUGHS AT HIM AND HE IS NOT LIKELY TO THINK OF HERIN ANY OTHER THAN A BROTHERLY WAY
CALEB MADE NO REJOINDER BUT PRESENTLY LOWERED HIS SPECTACLES DREW UPHIS CHAIR TO THE DESK AND SAID DEUCE TAKE THE BILLI WISH IT WAS ATHANOVER
 THESE THINGS ARE A SAD INTERRUPTION TO BUSINESS
THE FIRST PART OF THIS SPEECH COMPRISED HIS WHOLE STORE OF MALEDICTORYEXPRESSION AND WAS UTTERED WITH A SLIGHT SNARL EASY TO IMAGINE
 BUT ITWOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CONVEY TO THOSE WHO NEVER HEARD HIM UTTER THEWORD BUSINESS THE PECULIAR TONE OF FERVID VENERATION OF RELIGIOUSREGARD IN WHICH HE WRAPPED IT AS A CONSECRATED SYMBOL IS WRAPPED INITS GOLDFRINGED LINEN
CALEB GARTH OFTEN SHOOK HIS HEAD IN MEDITATION ON THE VALUE THEINDISPENSABLE MIGHT OF THAT MYRIADHEADED MYRIADHANDED LABOR BY WHICHTHE SOCIAL BODY IS FED CLOTHED AND HOUSED
 IT HAD LAID HOLD OF HISIMAGINATION IN BOYHOOD
 THE ECHOES OF THE GREAT HAMMER WHERE ROOF ORKEEL WERE AMAKING THE SIGNALSHOUTS OF THE WORKMEN THE ROAR OF THEFURNACE THE THUNDER AND PLASH OF THE ENGINE WERE A SUBLIME MUSIC TOHIM THE FELLING AND LADING OF TIMBER AND THE HUGE TRUNK VIBRATINGSTARLIKE IN THE DISTANCE ALONG THE HIGHWAY THE CRANE AT WORK ON THEWHARF THE PILEDUP PRODUCE IN WAREHOUSES THE PRECISION AND VARIETY OFMUSCULAR EFFORT WHEREVER EXACT WORK HAD TO BE TURNED OUTALL THESESIGHTS OF HIS YOUTH HAD ACTED ON HIM AS POETRY WITHOUT THE AID OF THEPOETS HAD MADE A PHILOSOPHY FOR HIM WITHOUT THE AID OF PHILOSOPHERS ARELIGION WITHOUT THE AID OF THEOLOGY
 HIS EARLY AMBITION HAD BEEN TOHAVE AS EFFECTIVE A SHARE AS POSSIBLE IN THIS SUBLIME LABOR WHICH WASPECULIARLY DIGNIFIED BY HIM WITH THE NAME OF BUSINESS AND THOUGH HEHAD ONLY BEEN A SHORT TIME UNDER A SURVEYOR AND HAD BEEN CHIEFLY HISOWN TEACHER HE KNEW MORE OF LAND BUILDING AND MINING THAN MOST OFTHE SPECIAL MEN IN THE COUNTY
HIS CLASSIFICATION OF HUMAN EMPLOYMENTS WAS RATHER CRUDE AND LIKE THECATEGORIES OF MORE CELEBRATED MEN WOULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE IN THESEADVANCED TIMES
 HE DIVIDED THEM INTO BUSINESS POLITICS PREACHINGLEARNING AND AMUSEMENT
 HE HAD NOTHING TO SAY AGAINST THE LAST FOURBUT HE REGARDED THEM AS A REVERENTIAL PAGAN REGARDED OTHER GODS THANHIS OWN
 IN THE SAME WAY HE THOUGHT VERY WELL OF ALL RANKS BUT HEWOULD NOT HIMSELF HAVE LIKED TO BE OF ANY RANK IN WHICH HE HAD NOT SUCHCLOSE CONTACT WITH BUSINESS AS TO GET OFTEN HONORABLY DECORATED WITHMARKS OF DUST AND MORTAR THE DAMP OF THE ENGINE OR THE SWEET SOIL OFTHE WOODS AND FIELDS
 THOUGH HE HAD NEVER REGARDED HIMSELF AS OTHERTHAN AN ORTHODOX CHRISTIAN AND WOULD ARGUE ON PREVENIENT GRACE IF THESUBJECT WERE PROPOSED TO HIM I THINK HIS VIRTUAL DIVINITIES WERE GOODPRACTICAL SCHEMES ACCURATE WORK AND THE FAITHFUL COMPLETION OFUNDERTAKINGS HIS PRINCE OF DARKNESS WAS A SLACK WORKMAN
 BUT THERE WASNO SPIRIT OF DENIAL IN CALEB AND THE WORLD SEEMED SO WONDROUS TO HIMTHAT HE WAS READY TO ACCEPT ANY NUMBER OF SYSTEMS LIKE ANY NUMBER OFFIRMAMENTS IF THEY DID NOT OBVIOUSLY INTERFERE WITH THE BESTLANDDRAINAGE SOLID BUILDING CORRECT MEASURING AND JUDICIOUS BORINGFOR COAL
 IN FACT HE HAD A REVERENTIAL SOUL WITH A STRONG PRACTICALINTELLIGENCE
 BUT HE COULD NOT MANAGE FINANCE HE KNEW VALUES WELL BUTHE HAD NO KEENNESS OF IMAGINATION FOR MONETARY RESULTS IN THE SHAPE OFPROFIT AND LOSS AND HAVING ASCERTAINED THIS TO HIS COST HE DETERMINEDTO GIVE UP ALL FORMS OF HIS BELOVED BUSINESS WHICH REQUIRED THATTALENT
 HE GAVE HIMSELF UP ENTIRELY TO THE MANY KINDS OF WORK WHICH HECOULD DO WITHOUT HANDLING CAPITAL AND WAS ONE OF THOSE PRECIOUS MENWITHIN HIS OWN DISTRICT WHOM EVERYBODY WOULD CHOOSE TO WORK FOR THEMBECAUSE HE DID HIS WORK WELL CHARGED VERY LITTLE AND OFTEN DECLINEDTO CHARGE AT ALL
 IT IS NO WONDER THEN THAT THE GARTHS WERE POOR ANDLIVED IN A SMALL WAY
 HOWEVER THEY DID NOT MIND IT

 BLAKE SONGS OF EXPERIENCE
FRED VINCY WANTED TO ARRIVE AT STONE COURT WHEN MARY COULD NOT EXPECTHIM AND WHEN HIS UNCLE WAS NOT DOWNSTAIRS IN THAT CASE SHE MIGHT BESITTING ALONE IN THE WAINSCOTED PARLOR
 HE LEFT HIS HORSE IN THE YARDTO AVOID MAKING A NOISE ON THE GRAVEL IN FRONT AND ENTERED THE PARLORWITHOUT OTHER NOTICE THAN THE NOISE OF THE DOORHANDLE
 MARY WAS IN HERUSUAL CORNER LAUGHING OVER MRS
 PIOZZIS RECOLLECTIONS OF JOHNSON ANDLOOKED UP WITH THE FUN STILL IN HER FACE
 IT GRADUALLY FADED AS SHE SAWFRED APPROACH HER WITHOUT SPEAKING AND STAND BEFORE HER WITH HIS ELBOWON THE MANTELPIECE LOOKING ILL
 SHE TOO WAS SILENT ONLY RAISING HEREYES TO HIM INQUIRINGLY
MARY HE BEGAN I AM A GOODFORNOTHING BLACKGUARD
I SHOULD THINK ONE OF THOSE EPITHETS WOULD DO AT A TIME SAID MARYTRYING TO SMILE BUT FEELING ALARMED
I KNOW YOU WILL NEVER THINK WELL OF ME ANY MORE
 YOU WILL THINK ME ALIAR
 YOU WILL THINK ME DISHONEST
 YOU WILL THINK I DIDNT CARE FORYOU OR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER
 YOU ALWAYS DO MAKE THE WORST OF ME IKNOW
I CANNOT DENY THAT I SHALL THINK ALL THAT OF YOU FRED IF YOU GIVE MEGOOD REASONS
 BUT PLEASE TO TELL ME AT ONCE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE
 I WOULDRATHER KNOW THE PAINFUL TRUTH THAN IMAGINE IT
I OWED MONEYA HUNDRED AND SIXTY POUNDS
 I ASKED YOUR FATHER TO PUTHIS NAME TO A BILL
 I THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT SIGNIFY TO HIM
 I MADE SUREOF PAYING THE MONEY MYSELF AND I HAVE TRIED AS HARD AS I COULD
 ANDNOW I HAVE BEEN SO UNLUCKYA HORSE HAS TURNED OUT BADLYI CAN ONLY PAYFIFTY POUNDS
 AND I CANT ASK MY FATHER FOR THE MONEY HE WOULD NOTGIVE ME A FARTHING
 AND MY UNCLE GAVE ME A HUNDRED A LITTLE WHILE AGO
SO WHAT CAN I DO
 AND NOW YOUR FATHER HAS NO READY MONEY TO SPARE ANDYOUR MOTHER WILL HAVE TO PAY AWAY HER NINETYTWO POUNDS THAT SHE HASSAVED AND SHE SAYS YOUR SAVINGS MUST GO TOO
 YOU SEE WHAT AOH POOR MOTHER POOR FATHER
 SAID MARY HER EYES FILLING WITH TEARSAND A LITTLE SOB RISING WHICH SHE TRIED TO REPRESS
 SHE LOOKED STRAIGHTBEFORE HER AND TOOK NO NOTICE OF FRED ALL THE CONSEQUENCES AT HOMEBECOMING PRESENT TO HER
 HE TOO REMAINED SILENT FOR SOME MOMENTSFEELING MORE MISERABLE THAN EVER
 I WOULDNT HAVE HURT YOU FOR THEWORLD MARY HE SAID AT LAST
 YOU CAN NEVER FORGIVE ME
WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHETHER I FORGIVE YOU
 SAID MARY PASSIONATELY
WOULD THAT MAKE IT ANY BETTER FOR MY MOTHER TO LOSE THE MONEY SHE HASBEEN EARNING BY LESSONS FOR FOUR YEARS THAT SHE MIGHT SEND ALFRED TOMR
 HANMERS
 SHOULD YOU THINK ALL THAT PLEASANT ENOUGH IF I FORGAVEYOU
SAY WHAT YOU LIKE MARY
 I DESERVE IT ALL
I DONT WANT TO SAY ANYTHING SAID MARY MORE QUIETLY AND MY ANGERIS OF NO USE
 SHE DRIED HER EYES THREW ASIDE HER BOOK ROSE ANDFETCHED HER SEWING
FRED FOLLOWED HER WITH HIS EYES HOPING THAT THEY WOULD MEET HERS ANDIN THAT WAY FIND ACCESS FOR HIS IMPLORING PENITENCE
 BUT NO
 MARY COULDEASILY AVOID LOOKING UPWARD
I DO CARE ABOUT YOUR MOTHERS MONEY GOING HE SAID WHEN SHE WASSEATED AGAIN AND SEWING QUICKLY
 I WANTED TO ASK YOU MARYDONT YOUTHINK THAT MR
 FEATHERSTONEIF YOU WERE TO TELL HIMTELL HIM I MEANABOUT APPRENTICING ALFREDWOULD ADVANCE THE MONEY
MY FAMILY IS NOT FOND OF BEGGING FRED
 WE WOULD RATHER WORK FOR OURMONEY
 BESIDES YOU SAY THAT MR
 FEATHERSTONE HAS LATELY GIVEN YOU AHUNDRED POUNDS
 HE RARELY MAKES PRESENTS HE HAS NEVER MADE PRESENTS TOUS
 I AM SURE MY FATHER WILL NOT ASK HIM FOR ANYTHING AND EVEN IF ICHOSE TO BEG OF HIM IT WOULD BE OF NO USE
I AM SO MISERABLE MARYIF YOU KNEW HOW MISERABLE I AM YOU WOULD BESORRY FOR ME
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS TO BE MORE SORRY FOR THAN THAT
 BUT SELFISHPEOPLE ALWAYS THINK THEIR OWN DISCOMFORT OF MORE IMPORTANCE THANANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD
 I SEE ENOUGH OF THAT EVERY DAY
IT IS HARDLY FAIR TO CALL ME SELFISH
 IF YOU KNEW WHAT THINGS OTHERYOUNG MEN DO YOU WOULD THINK ME A GOOD WAY OFF THE WORST
I KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY ON THEMSELVESWITHOUT KNOWING HOW THEY SHALL PAY MUST BE SELFISH
 THEY ARE ALWAYSTHINKING OF WHAT THEY CAN GET FOR THEMSELVES AND NOT OF WHAT OTHERPEOPLE MAY LOSE
ANY MAN MAY BE UNFORTUNATE MARY AND FIND HIMSELF UNABLE TO PAY WHENHE MEANT IT
 THERE IS NOT A BETTER MAN IN THE WORLD THAN YOUR FATHERAND YET HE GOT INTO TROUBLE
HOW DARE YOU MAKE ANY COMPARISON BETWEEN MY FATHER AND YOU FRED
SAID MARY IN A DEEP TONE OF INDIGNATION
 HE NEVER GOT INTO TROUBLE BYTHINKING OF HIS OWN IDLE PLEASURES BUT BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS THINKINGOF THE WORK HE WAS DOING FOR OTHER PEOPLE
 AND HE HAS FARED HARD ANDWORKED HARD TO MAKE GOOD EVERYBODYS LOSS
AND YOU THINK THAT I SHALL NEVER TRY TO MAKE GOOD ANYTHING MARY
 ITIS NOT GENEROUS TO BELIEVE THE WORST OF A MAN
 WHEN YOU HAVE GOT ANYPOWER OVER HIM I THINK YOU MIGHT TRY AND USE IT TO MAKE HIM BETTERBUT THAT IS WHAT YOU NEVER DO
 HOWEVER IM GOING FRED ENDEDLANGUIDLY
 I SHALL NEVER SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT ANYTHING AGAIN
 IM VERYSORRY FOR ALL THE TROUBLE IVE CAUSEDTHATS ALL
MARY HAD DROPPED HER WORK OUT OF HER HAND AND LOOKED UP
 THERE IS OFTENSOMETHING MATERNAL EVEN IN A GIRLISH LOVE AND MARYS HARD EXPERIENCEHAD WROUGHT HER NATURE TO AN IMPRESSIBILITY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THATHARD SLIGHT THING WHICH WE CALL GIRLISHNESS
 AT FREDS LAST WORDS SHEFELT AN INSTANTANEOUS PANG SOMETHING LIKE WHAT A MOTHER FEELS AT THEIMAGINED SOBS OR CRIES OF HER NAUGHTY TRUANT CHILD WHICH MAY LOSEITSELF AND GET HARM
 AND WHEN LOOKING UP HER EYES MET HIS DULLDESPAIRING GLANCE HER PITY FOR HIM SURMOUNTED HER ANGER AND ALL HEROTHER ANXIETIES
OH FRED HOW ILL YOU LOOK
 SIT DOWN A MOMENT
 DONT GO YET
 LET METELL UNCLE THAT YOU ARE HERE
 HE HAS BEEN WONDERING THAT HE HAS NOTSEEN YOU FOR A WHOLE WEEK
 MARY SPOKE HURRIEDLY SAYING THE WORDS THATCAME FIRST WITHOUT KNOWING VERY WELL WHAT THEY WERE BUT SAYING THEM INA HALFSOOTHING HALFBESEECHING TONE AND RISING AS IF TO GO AWAY TOMR
 FEATHERSTONE
 OF COURSE FRED FELT AS IF THE CLOUDS HAD PARTED AND AGLEAM HAD COME HE MOVED AND STOOD IN HER WAY
SAY ONE WORD MARY AND I WILL DO ANYTHING
 SAY YOU WILL NOT THINK THEWORST OF MEWILL NOT GIVE ME UP ALTOGETHER
AS IF IT WERE ANY PLEASURE TO ME TO THINK ILL OF YOU SAID MARY IN AMOURNFUL TONE
 AS IF IT WERE NOT VERY PAINFUL TO ME TO SEE YOU AN IDLEFRIVOLOUS CREATURE
 HOW CAN YOU BEAR TO BE SO CONTEMPTIBLE WHEN OTHERSARE WORKING AND STRIVING AND THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO BE DONEHOWCAN YOU BEAR TO BE FIT FOR NOTHING IN THE WORLD THAT IS USEFUL
 ANDWITH SO MUCH GOOD IN YOUR DISPOSITION FREDYOU MIGHT BE WORTH A GREATDEAL
I WILL TRY TO BE ANYTHING YOU LIKE MARY IF YOU WILL SAY THAT YOULOVE ME
I SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO SAY THAT I LOVED A MAN WHO MUST ALWAYS BEHANGING ON OTHERS AND RECKONING ON WHAT THEY WOULD DO FOR HIM
 WHATWILL YOU BE WHEN YOU ARE FORTY
 LIKE MR
 BOWYER I SUPPOSEJUST ASIDLE LIVING IN MRS
 BECKS FRONT PARLORFAT AND SHABBY HOPINGSOMEBODY WILL INVITE YOU TO DINNERSPENDING YOUR MORNING IN LEARNING ACOMIC SONGOH NO
 LEARNING A TUNE ON THE FLUTE
MARYS LIPS HAD BEGUN TO CURL WITH A SMILE AS SOON AS SHE HAD ASKEDTHAT QUESTION ABOUT FREDS FUTURE YOUNG SOULS ARE MOBILE AND BEFORESHE ENDED HER FACE HAD ITS FULL ILLUMINATION OF FUN
 TO HIM IT WASLIKE THE CESSATION OF AN ACHE THAT MARY COULD LAUGH AT HIM AND WITH APASSIVE SORT OF SMILE HE TRIED TO REACH HER HAND BUT SHE SLIPPED AWAYQUICKLY TOWARDS THE DOOR AND SAID I SHALL TELL UNCLE
 YOU MUST SEEHIM FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
FRED SECRETLY FELT THAT HIS FUTURE WAS GUARANTEED AGAINST THEFULFILMENT OF MARYS SARCASTIC PROPHECIES APART FROM THAT ANYTHINGWHICH HE WAS READY TO DO IF SHE WOULD DEFINE IT
 HE NEVER DARED INMARYS PRESENCE TO APPROACH THE SUBJECT OF HIS EXPECTATIONS FROM MR
FEATHERSTONE AND SHE ALWAYS IGNORED THEM AS IF EVERYTHING DEPENDED ONHIMSELF
 BUT IF EVER HE ACTUALLY CAME INTO THE PROPERTY SHE MUSTRECOGNIZE THE CHANGE IN HIS POSITION
 ALL THIS PASSED THROUGH HIS MINDSOMEWHAT LANGUIDLY BEFORE HE WENT UP TO SEE HIS UNCLE
 HE STAYED BUT ALITTLE WHILE EXCUSING HIMSELF ON THE GROUND THAT HE HAD A COLD ANDMARY DID NOT REAPPEAR BEFORE HE LEFT THE HOUSE
 BUT AS HE RODE HOME HEBEGAN TO BE MORE CONSCIOUS OF BEING ILL THAN OF BEING MELANCHOLY
WHEN CALEB GARTH ARRIVED AT STONE COURT SOON AFTER DUSK MARY WAS NOTSURPRISED ALTHOUGH HE SELDOM HAD LEISURE FOR PAYING HER A VISIT ANDWAS NOT AT ALL FOND OF HAVING TO TALK WITH MR
 FEATHERSTONE
 THE OLDMAN ON THE OTHER HAND FELT HIMSELF ILL AT EASE WITH A BROTHERINLAWWHOM HE COULD NOT ANNOY WHO DID NOT MIND ABOUT BEING CONSIDERED POORHAD NOTHING TO ASK OF HIM AND UNDERSTOOD ALL KINDS OF FARMING ANDMINING BUSINESS BETTER THAN HE DID
 BUT MARY HAD FELT SURE THAT HERPARENTS WOULD WANT TO SEE HER AND IF HER FATHER HAD NOT COME SHEWOULD HAVE OBTAINED LEAVE TO GO HOME FOR AN HOUR OR TWO THE NEXT DAY
AFTER DISCUSSING PRICES DURING TEA WITH MR
 FEATHERSTONE CALEB ROSE TOBID HIM GOODBY AND SAID I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU MARY
SHE TOOK A CANDLE INTO ANOTHER LARGE PARLOR WHERE THERE WAS NO FIREAND SETTING DOWN THE FEEBLE LIGHT ON THE DARK MAHOGANY TABLE TURNEDROUND TO HER FATHER AND PUTTING HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK KISSED HIMWITH CHILDISH KISSES WHICH HE DELIGHTED INTHE EXPRESSION OF HIS LARGEBROWS SOFTENING AS THE EXPRESSION OF A GREAT BEAUTIFUL DOG SOFTENS WHENIT IS CARESSED
 MARY WAS HIS FAVORITE CHILD AND WHATEVER SUSAN MIGHTSAY AND RIGHT AS SHE WAS ON ALL OTHER SUBJECTS CALEB THOUGHT ITNATURAL THAT FRED OR ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD THINK MARY MORE LOVABLE THANOTHER GIRLS
IVE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU MY DEAR SAID CALEB IN HIS HESITATINGWAY
 NO VERY GOOD NEWS BUT THEN IT MIGHT BE WORSE
ABOUT MONEY FATHER
 I THINK I KNOW WHAT IT IS
AY
 HOW CAN THAT BE
 YOU SEE IVE BEEN A BIT OF A FOOL AGAIN AND PUTMY NAME TO A BILL AND NOW IT COMES TO PAYING AND YOUR MOTHER HAS GOTTO PART WITH HER SAVINGS THATS THE WORST OF IT AND EVEN THEY WONTQUITE MAKE THINGS EVEN
 WE WANTED A HUNDRED AND TEN POUNDS YOUR MOTHERHAS NINETYTWO AND I HAVE NONE TO SPARE IN THE BANK AND SHE THINKSTHAT YOU HAVE SOME SAVINGS
OH YES I HAVE MORE THAN FOURANDTWENTY POUNDS
 I THOUGHT YOU WOULDCOME FATHER SO I PUT IT IN MY BAG
 SEE
 BEAUTIFUL WHITE NOTES ANDGOLD
MARY TOOK OUT THE FOLDED MONEY FROM HER RETICULE AND PUT IT INTO HERFATHERS HAND
WELL BUT HOWWE ONLY WANT EIGHTEENHERE PUT THE REST BACKCHILDBUT HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT IT
 SAID CALEB WHO IN HISUNCONQUERABLE INDIFFERENCE TO MONEY WAS BEGINNING TO BE CHIEFLYCONCERNED ABOUT THE RELATION THE AFFAIR MIGHT HAVE TO MARYSAFFECTIONS
FRED TOLD ME THIS MORNING
AH
 DID HE COME ON PURPOSE
YES I THINK SO
 HE WAS A GOOD DEAL DISTRESSED
IM AFRAID FRED IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED MARY SAID THE FATHER WITHHESITATING TENDERNESS
 HE MEANS BETTER THAN HE ACTS PERHAPS
 BUT ISHOULD THINK IT A PITY FOR ANY BODYS HAPPINESS TO BE WRAPPED UP INHIM AND SO WOULD YOUR MOTHER
AND SO SHOULD I FATHER SAID MARY NOT LOOKING UP BUT PUTTING THEBACK OF HER FATHERS HAND AGAINST HER CHEEK
I DONT WANT TO PRY MY DEAR
 BUT I WAS AFRAID THERE MIGHT BESOMETHING BETWEEN YOU AND FRED AND I WANTED TO CAUTION YOU
 YOU SEEMARYHERE CALEBS VOICE BECAME MORE TENDER HE HAD BEEN PUSHING HISHAT ABOUT ON THE TABLE AND LOOKING AT IT BUT FINALLY HE TURNED HISEYES ON HIS DAUGHTERA WOMAN LET HER BE AS GOOD AS SHE MAY HAS GOTTO PUT UP WITH THE LIFE HER HUSBAND MAKES FOR HER
 YOUR MOTHER HAS HADTO PUT UP WITH A GOOD DEAL BECAUSE OF ME
MARY TURNED THE BACK OF HER FATHERS HAND TO HER LIPS AND SMILED ATHIM
WELL WELL NOBODYS PERFECT BUTHERE MR
 GARTH SHOOK HIS HEAD TOHELP OUT THE INADEQUACY OF WORDSWHAT I AM THINKING OF ISWHAT IT MUSTBE FOR A WIFE WHEN SHES NEVER SURE OF HER HUSBAND WHEN HE HASNT GOTA PRINCIPLE IN HIM TO MAKE HIM MORE AFRAID OF DOING THE WRONG THING BYOTHERS THAN OF GETTING HIS OWN TOES PINCHED
 THATS THE LONG AND THESHORT OF IT MARY
 YOUNG FOLKS MAY GET FOND OF EACH OTHER BEFORE THEYKNOW WHAT LIFE IS AND THEY MAY THINK IT ALL HOLIDAY IF THEY CAN ONLYGET TOGETHER BUT IT SOON TURNS INTO WORKING DAY MY DEAR
 HOWEVER YOUHAVE MORE SENSE THAN MOST AND YOU HAVENT BEEN KEPT IN COTTONWOOLTHERE MAY BE NO OCCASION FOR ME TO SAY THIS BUT A FATHER TREMBLES FORHIS DAUGHTER AND YOU ARE ALL BY YOURSELF HERE
DONT FEAR FOR ME FATHER SAID MARY GRAVELY MEETING HER FATHERSEYES FRED HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME HE IS KINDHEARTED ANDAFFECTIONATE AND NOT FALSE I THINK WITH ALL HIS SELFINDULGENCE
 BUTI WILL NEVER ENGAGE MYSELF TO ONE WHO HAS NO MANLY INDEPENDENCE ANDWHO GOES ON LOITERING AWAY HIS TIME ON THE CHANCE THAT OTHERS WILLPROVIDE FOR HIM
 YOU AND MY MOTHER HAVE TAUGHT ME TOO MUCH PRIDE FORTHAT
THATS RIGHTTHATS RIGHT
 THEN I AM EASY SAID MR
 GARTH TAKING UPHIS HAT
 BUT ITS HARD TO RUN AWAY WITH YOUR EARNINGS EH CHILD
FATHER
 SAID MARY IN HER DEEPEST TONE OF REMONSTRANCE
 TAKEPOCKETFULS OF LOVE BESIDES TO THEM ALL AT HOME WAS HER LAST WORDBEFORE HE CLOSED THE OUTER DOOR ON HIMSELF
I SUPPOSE YOUR FATHER WANTED YOUR EARNINGS SAID OLD MR
FEATHERSTONE WITH HIS USUAL POWER OF UNPLEASANT SURMISE WHEN MARYRETURNED TO HIM
 HE MAKES BUT A TIGHT FIT I RECKON
 YOURE OF AGENOW YOU OUGHT TO BE SAVING FOR YOURSELF
I CONSIDER MY FATHER AND MOTHER THE BEST PART OF MYSELF SIR SAIDMARY COLDLY
MR
 FEATHERSTONE GRUNTED HE COULD NOT DENY THAT AN ORDINARY SORT OFGIRL LIKE HER MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO BE USEFUL SO HE THOUGHT OF ANOTHERREJOINDER DISAGREEABLE ENOUGH TO BE ALWAYS APROPOS
 IF FRED VINCYCOMES TOMORROW NOW DONT YOU KEEP HIM CHATTERING LET HIM COME UP TOME
CHAPTER XXVI
HE BEATS ME AND I RAIL AT HIM O WORTHY SATISFACTION
 WOULD IT WEREOTHERWISETHAT I COULD BEAT HIM WHILE HE RAILED AT ME
TROILUS ANDCRESSIDA
BUT FRED DID NOT GO TO STONE COURT THE NEXT DAY FOR REASONS THAT WEREQUITE PEREMPTORY
 FROM THOSE VISITS TO UNSANITARY HOUNDSLEY STREETS INSEARCH OF DIAMOND HE HAD BROUGHT BACK NOT ONLY A BAD BARGAIN INHORSEFLESH BUT THE FURTHER MISFORTUNE OF SOME AILMENT WHICH FOR A DAYOR TWO HAD DEEMED MERE DEPRESSION AND HEADACHE BUT WHICH GOT SO MUCHWORSE WHEN HE RETURNED FROM HIS VISIT TO STONE COURT THAT GOING INTOTHE DININGROOM HE THREW HIMSELF ON THE SOFA AND IN ANSWER TO HISMOTHERS ANXIOUS QUESTION SAID I FEEL VERY ILL I THINK YOU MUSTSEND FOR WRENCH
WRENCH CAME BUT DID NOT APPREHEND ANYTHING SERIOUS SPOKE OF A SLIGHTDERANGEMENT AND DID NOT SPEAK OF COMING AGAIN ON THE MORROW
 HE HAD ADUE VALUE FOR THE VINCYS HOUSE BUT THE WARIEST MEN ARE APT TO BEDULLED BY ROUTINE AND ON WORRIED MORNINGS WILL SOMETIMES GO THROUGHTHEIR BUSINESS WITH THE ZEST OF THE DAILY BELLRINGER
 MR
 WRENCH WAS ASMALL NEAT BILIOUS MAN WITH A WELLDRESSED WIG HE HAD A LABORIOUSPRACTICE AN IRASCIBLE TEMPER A LYMPHATIC WIFE AND SEVEN CHILDREN ANDHE WAS ALREADY RATHER LATE BEFORE SETTING OUT ON A FOURMILES DRIVE TOMEET DR
 MINCHIN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TIPTON THE DECEASE OF HICKS ARURAL PRACTITIONER HAVING INCREASED MIDDLEMARCH PRACTICE IN THATDIRECTION
 GREAT STATESMEN ERR AND WHY NOT SMALL MEDICAL MEN
 MR
WRENCH DID NOT NEGLECT SENDING THE USUAL WHITE PARCELS WHICH THIS TIMEHAD BLACK AND DRASTIC CONTENTS
 THEIR EFFECT WAS NOT ALLEVIATING TOPOOR FRED WHO HOWEVER UNWILLING AS HE SAID TO BELIEVE THAT HE WASIN FOR AN ILLNESS ROSE AT HIS USUAL EASY HOUR THE NEXT MORNING ANDWENT DOWNSTAIRS MEANING TO BREAKFAST BUT SUCCEEDED IN NOTHING BUT INSITTING AND SHIVERING BY THE FIRE
 MR
 WRENCH WAS AGAIN SENT FOR BUTWAS GONE ON HIS ROUNDS AND MRS
 VINCY SEEING HER DARLINGS CHANGEDLOOKS AND GENERAL MISERY BEGAN TO CRY AND SAID SHE WOULD SEND FOR DR
SPRAGUE
OH NONSENSE MOTHER
 ITS NOTHING SAID FRED PUTTING OUT HIS HOTDRY HAND TO HER I SHALL SOON BE ALL RIGHT
 I MUST HAVE TAKEN COLD INTHAT NASTY DAMP RIDE
MAMMA
 SAID ROSAMOND WHO WAS SEATED NEAR THE WINDOW THE DININGROOMWINDOWS LOOKED ON THAT HIGHLY RESPECTABLE STREET CALLED LOWICK GATETHERE IS MR
 LYDGATE STOPPING TO SPEAK TO SOME ONE
 IF I WERE YOU IWOULD CALL HIM IN
 HE HAS CURED ELLEN BULSTRODE
 THEY SAY HE CURESEVERY ONE
MRS
 VINCY SPRANG TO THE WINDOW AND OPENED IT IN AN INSTANT THINKINGONLY OF FRED AND NOT OF MEDICAL ETIQUETTE
 LYDGATE WAS ONLY TWO YARDSOFF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF SOME IRON PALISADING AND TURNED ROUND AT THESUDDEN SOUND OF THE SASH BEFORE SHE CALLED TO HIM
 IN TWO MINUTES HEWAS IN THE ROOM AND ROSAMOND WENT OUT AFTER WAITING JUST LONG ENOUGHTO SHOW A PRETTY ANXIETY CONFLICTING WITH HER SENSE OF WHAT WASBECOMING
LYDGATE HAD TO HEAR A NARRATIVE IN WHICH MRS
 VINCYS MIND INSISTEDWITH REMARKABLE INSTINCT ON EVERY POINT OF MINOR IMPORTANCE ESPECIALLYON WHAT MR
 WRENCH HAD SAID AND HAD NOT SAID ABOUT COMING AGAIN
 THATTHERE MIGHT BE AN AWKWARD AFFAIR WITH WRENCH LYDGATE SAW AT ONCE BUTTHE CASE WAS SERIOUS ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM DISMISS THAT CONSIDERATION HEWAS CONVINCED THAT FRED WAS IN THE PINKSKINNED STAGE OF TYPHOID FEVERAND THAT HE HAD TAKEN JUST THE WRONG MEDICINES
 HE MUST GO TO BEDIMMEDIATELY MUST HAVE A REGULAR NURSE AND VARIOUS APPLIANCES ANDPRECAUTIONS MUST BE USED ABOUT WHICH LYDGATE WAS PARTICULAR
 POOR MRS
VINCYS TERROR AT THESE INDICATIONS OF DANGER FOUND VENT IN SUCH WORDSAS CAME MOST EASILY
 SHE THOUGHT IT VERY ILL USAGE ON THE PART OF MR
WRENCH WHO HAD ATTENDED THEIR HOUSE SO MANY YEARS IN PREFERENCE TO MR
PEACOCK THOUGH MR
 PEACOCK WAS EQUALLY A FRIEND
 WHY MR
 WRENCH SHOULDNEGLECT HER CHILDREN MORE THAN OTHERS SHE COULD NOT FOR THE LIFE OFHER UNDERSTAND
 HE HAD NOT NEGLECTED MRS
 LARCHERS WHEN THEY HAD THEMEASLES NOR INDEED WOULD MRS
 VINCY HAVE WISHED THAT HE SHOULD
 AND IFANYTHING SHOULD HAPPENHERE POOR MRS
 VINCYS SPIRIT QUITE BROKE DOWN AND HER NIOBE THROATAND GOODHUMORED FACE WERE SADLY CONVULSED
 THIS WAS IN THE HALL OUT OFFREDS HEARING BUT ROSAMOND HAD OPENED THE DRAWINGROOM DOOR AND NOWCAME FORWARD ANXIOUSLY
 LYDGATE APOLOGIZED FOR MR
 WRENCH SAID THATTHE SYMPTOMS YESTERDAY MIGHT HAVE BEEN DISGUISING AND THAT THIS FORMOF FEVER WAS VERY EQUIVOCAL IN ITS BEGINNINGS HE WOULD GO IMMEDIATELYTO THE DRUGGISTS AND HAVE A PRESCRIPTION MADE UP IN ORDER TO LOSE NOTIME BUT HE WOULD WRITE TO MR
 WRENCH AND TELL HIM WHAT HAD BEEN DONE
BUT YOU MUST COME AGAINYOU MUST GO ON ATTENDING FRED
 I CANT HAVE MYBOY LEFT TO ANYBODY WHO MAY COME OR NOT
 I BEAR NOBODY ILLWILL THANKGOD AND MR
 WRENCH SAVED ME IN THE PLEURISY BUT HED BETTER HAVE LETME DIEIFIFI WILL MEET MR
 WRENCH HERE THEN SHALL I
 SAID LYDGATE REALLYBELIEVING THAT WRENCH WAS NOT WELL PREPARED TO DEAL WISELY WITH A CASEOF THIS KIND
PRAY MAKE THAT ARRANGEMENT MR
 LYDGATE SAID ROSAMOND COMING TO HERMOTHERS AID AND SUPPORTING HER ARM TO LEAD HER AWAY
WHEN MR
 VINCY CAME HOME HE WAS VERY ANGRY WITH WRENCH AND DID NOTCARE IF HE NEVER CAME INTO HIS HOUSE AGAIN
 LYDGATE SHOULD GO ON NOWWHETHER WRENCH LIKED IT OR NOT
 IT WAS NO JOKE TO HAVE FEVER IN THEHOUSE
 EVERYBODY MUST BE SENT TO NOW NOT TO COME TO DINNER ONTHURSDAY
 AND PRITCHARD NEEDNT GET UP ANY WINE BRANDY WAS THE BESTTHING AGAINST INFECTION
 I SHALL DRINK BRANDY ADDED MR
 VINCYEMPHATICALLYAS MUCH AS TO SAY THIS WAS NOT AN OCCASION FOR FIRINGWITH BLANKCARTRIDGES
 HES AN UNCOMMONLY UNFORTUNATE LAD IS FRED
HED NEED HAVE SOME LUCK BY AND BY TO MAKE UP FOR ALL THISELSE I DONTKNOW WHOD HAVE AN ELDEST SON
DONT SAY SO VINCY SAID THE MOTHER WITH A QUIVERING LIP IF YOUDONT WANT HIM TO BE TAKEN FROM ME
IT WILL WORRET YOU TO DEATH LUCY THAT I CAN SEE SAID MR
 VINCYMORE MILDLY
 HOWEVER WRENCH SHALL KNOW WHAT I THINK OF THE MATTER
WHAT MR
 VINCY THOUGHT CONFUSEDLY WAS THAT THE FEVER MIGHT SOMEHOWHAVE BEEN HINDERED IF WRENCH HAD SHOWN THE PROPER SOLICITUDE ABOUTHISTHE MAYORSFAMILY
 IM THE LAST MAN TO GIVE IN TO THE CRY ABOUTNEW DOCTORS OR NEW PARSONS EITHERWHETHER THEYRE BULSTRODES MEN ORNOT
 BUT WRENCH SHALL KNOW WHAT I THINK TAKE IT AS HE WILL
WRENCH DID NOT TAKE IT AT ALL WELL
 LYDGATE WAS AS POLITE AS HE COULDBE IN HIS OFFHAND WAY BUT POLITENESS IN A MAN WHO HAS PLACED YOU AT ADISADVANTAGE IS ONLY AN ADDITIONAL EXASPERATION ESPECIALLY IF HEHAPPENS TO HAVE BEEN AN OBJECT OF DISLIKE BEFOREHAND
 COUNTRYPRACTITIONERS USED TO BE AN IRRITABLE SPECIES SUSCEPTIBLE ON THE POINTOF HONOR AND MR
 WRENCH WAS ONE OF THE MOST IRRITABLE AMONG THEM
 HEDID NOT REFUSE TO MEET LYDGATE IN THE EVENING BUT HIS TEMPER WASSOMEWHAT TRIED ON THE OCCASION
 HE HAD TO HEAR MRS
 VINCY SAYOH MR
 WRENCH WHAT HAVE I EVER DONE THAT YOU SHOULD USE ME SO
 TOGO AWAY AND NEVER TO COME AGAIN
 AND MY BOY MIGHT HAVE BEEN STRETCHEDA CORPSE
MR
 VINCY WHO HAD BEEN KEEPING UP A SHARP FIRE ON THE ENEMY INFECTIONAND WAS A GOOD DEAL HEATED IN CONSEQUENCE STARTED UP WHEN HE HEARDWRENCH COME IN AND WENT INTO THE HALL TO LET HIM KNOW WHAT HE THOUGHT
ILL TELL YOU WHAT WRENCH THIS IS BEYOND A JOKE SAID THE MAYORWHO OF LATE HAD HAD TO REBUKE OFFENDERS WITH AN OFFICIAL AIR AND NOWBROADENED HIMSELF BY PUTTING HIS THUMBS IN HIS ARMHOLES
 TO LET FEVERGET UNAWARES INTO A HOUSE LIKE THIS
 THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT OUGHTTO BE ACTIONABLE AND ARE NOT SO THATS MY OPINION
BUT IRRATIONAL REPROACHES WERE EASIER TO BEAR THAN THE SENSE OF BEINGINSTRUCTED OR RATHER THE SENSE THAT A YOUNGER MAN LIKE LYDGATEINWARDLY CONSIDERED HIM IN NEED OF INSTRUCTION FOR IN POINT OF FACTMR
 WRENCH AFTERWARDS SAID LYDGATE PARADED FLIGHTY FOREIGN NOTIONSWHICH WOULD NOT WEAR
 HE SWALLOWED HIS IRE FOR THE MOMENT BUT HEAFTERWARDS WROTE TO DECLINE FURTHER ATTENDANCE IN THE CASE
 THE HOUSEMIGHT BE A GOOD ONE BUT MR
 WRENCH WAS NOT GOING TO TRUCKLE TO ANYBODYON A PROFESSIONAL MATTER
 HE REFLECTED WITH MUCH PROBABILITY ON HISSIDE THAT LYDGATE WOULD BYANDBY BE CAUGHT TRIPPING TOO AND THAT HISUNGENTLEMANLY ATTEMPTS TO DISCREDIT THE SALE OF DRUGS BY HISPROFESSIONAL BRETHREN WOULD BYANDBY RECOIL ON HIMSELF
 HE THREW OUTBITING REMARKS ON LYDGATES TRICKS WORTHY ONLY OF A QUACK TO GETHIMSELF A FACTITIOUS REPUTATION WITH CREDULOUS PEOPLE
 THAT CANT ABOUTCURES WAS NEVER GOT UP BY SOUND PRACTITIONERS
THIS WAS A POINT ON WHICH LYDGATE SMARTED AS MUCH AS WRENCH COULDDESIRE
 TO BE PUFFED BY IGNORANCE WAS NOT ONLY HUMILIATING BUTPERILOUS AND NOT MORE ENVIABLE THAN THE REPUTATION OF THEWEATHERPROPHET
 HE WAS IMPATIENT OF THE FOOLISH EXPECTATIONS AMIDSTWHICH ALL WORK MUST BE CARRIED ON AND LIKELY ENOUGH TO DAMAGE HIMSELFAS MUCH AS MR
 WRENCH COULD WISH BY AN UNPROFESSIONAL OPENNESS
HOWEVER LYDGATE WAS INSTALLED AS MEDICAL ATTENDANT ON THE VINCYS ANDTHE EVENT WAS A SUBJECT OF GENERAL CONVERSATION IN MIDDLEMARCH
 SOMESAID THAT THE VINCYS HAD BEHAVED SCANDALOUSLY THAT MR
 VINCY HADTHREATENED WRENCH AND THAT MRS
 VINCY HAD ACCUSED HIM OF POISONING HERSON
 OTHERS WERE OF OPINION THAT MR
 LYDGATES PASSING BY WASPROVIDENTIAL THAT HE WAS WONDERFULLY CLEVER IN FEVERS AND THATBULSTRODE WAS IN THE RIGHT TO BRING HIM FORWARD
 MANY PEOPLE BELIEVEDTHAT LYDGATES COMING TO THE TOWN AT ALL WAS REALLY DUE TO BULSTRODEAND MRS
 TAFT WHO WAS ALWAYS COUNTING STITCHES AND GATHERED HERINFORMATION IN MISLEADING FRAGMENTS CAUGHT BETWEEN THE ROWS OF HERKNITTING HAD GOT IT INTO HER HEAD THAT MR
 LYDGATE WAS A NATURAL SONOF BULSTRODES A FACT WHICH SEEMED TO JUSTIFY HER SUSPICIONS OFEVANGELICAL LAYMEN
SHE ONE DAY COMMUNICATED THIS PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE TO MRS
 FAREBROTHERWHO DID NOT FAIL TO TELL HER SON OF IT OBSERVINGI SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING IN BULSTRODE BUT I SHOULD BESORRY TO THINK IT OF MR
 LYDGATE
WHY MOTHER SAID MR
 FAREBROTHER AFTER AN EXPLOSIVE LAUGH YOUKNOW VERY WELL THAT LYDGATE IS OF A GOOD FAMILY IN THE NORTH
 HE NEVERHEARD OF BULSTRODE BEFORE HE CAME HERE
THAT IS SATISFACTORY SO FAR AS MR
 LYDGATE IS CONCERNED CAMDEN SAIDTHE OLD LADY WITH AN AIR OF PRECISION
BUT AS TO BULSTRODETHE REPORTMAY BE TRUE OF SOME OTHER SON
CHAPTER XXVII
LET THE HIGH MUSE CHANT LOVES OLYMPIANWE ARE BUT MORTALS AND MUST SING OF MAN
AN EMINENT PHILOSOPHER AMONG MY FRIENDS WHO CAN DIGNIFY EVEN YOUR UGLYFURNITURE BY LIFTING IT INTO THE SERENE LIGHT OF SCIENCE HAS SHOWN METHIS PREGNANT LITTLE FACT
 YOUR PIERGLASS OR EXTENSIVE SURFACE OFPOLISHED STEEL MADE TO BE RUBBED BY A HOUSEMAID WILL BE MINUTELY ANDMULTITUDINOUSLY SCRATCHED IN ALL DIRECTIONS BUT PLACE NOW AGAINST IT ALIGHTED CANDLE AS A CENTRE OF ILLUMINATION AND LO
 THE SCRATCHES WILLSEEM TO ARRANGE THEMSELVES IN A FINE SERIES OF CONCENTRIC CIRCLES ROUNDTHAT LITTLE SUN
 IT IS DEMONSTRABLE THAT THE SCRATCHES ARE GOINGEVERYWHERE IMPARTIALLY AND IT IS ONLY YOUR CANDLE WHICH PRODUCES THEFLATTERING ILLUSION OF A CONCENTRIC ARRANGEMENT ITS LIGHT FALLING WITHAN EXCLUSIVE OPTICAL SELECTION
 THESE THINGS ARE A PARABLE
 THESCRATCHES ARE EVENTS AND THE CANDLE IS THE EGOISM OF ANY PERSON NOWABSENTOF MISS VINCY FOR EXAMPLE
 ROSAMOND HAD A PROVIDENCE OF HER OWNWHO HAD KINDLY MADE HER MORE CHARMING THAN OTHER GIRLS AND WHO SEEMEDTO HAVE ARRANGED FREDS ILLNESS AND MR
 WRENCHS MISTAKE IN ORDER TOBRING HER AND LYDGATE WITHIN EFFECTIVE PROXIMITY
 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOCONTRAVENE THESE ARRANGEMENTS IF ROSAMOND HAD CONSENTED TO GO AWAY TOSTONE COURT OR ELSEWHERE AS HER PARENTS WISHED HER TO DO ESPECIALLYSINCE MR
 LYDGATE THOUGHT THE PRECAUTION NEEDLESS
 THEREFORE WHILEMISS MORGAN AND THE CHILDREN WERE SENT AWAY TO A FARMHOUSE THE MORNINGAFTER FREDS ILLNESS HAD DECLARED ITSELF ROSAMOND REFUSED TO LEAVEPAPA AND MAMMA
POOR MAMMA INDEED WAS AN OBJECT TO TOUCH ANY CREATURE BORN OF WOMANAND MR
 VINCY WHO DOTED ON HIS WIFE WAS MORE ALARMED ON HER ACCOUNTTHAN ON FREDS
 BUT FOR HIS INSISTENCE SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN NO RESTHER BRIGHTNESS WAS ALL BEDIMMED UNCONSCIOUS OF HER COSTUME WHICH HADALWAYS BEEN SO FRESH AND GAY SHE WAS LIKE A SICK BIRD WITH LANGUID EYEAND PLUMAGE RUFFLED HER SENSES DULLED TO THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS THATUSED MOST TO INTEREST HER
 FREDS DELIRIUM IN WHICH HE SEEMED TO BEWANDERING OUT OF HER REACH TORE HER HEART
 AFTER HER FIRST OUTBURSTAGAINST MR
 WRENCH SHE WENT ABOUT VERY QUIETLY HER ONE LOW CRY WAS TOLYDGATE
 SHE WOULD FOLLOW HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND PUT HER HAND ON HISARM MOANING OUT SAVE MY BOY
 ONCE SHE PLEADED HE HAS ALWAYS BEENGOOD TO ME MR
 LYDGATE HE NEVER HAD A HARD WORD FOR HIS MOTHERASIF POOR FREDS SUFFERING WERE AN ACCUSATION AGAINST HIM
 ALL THEDEEPEST FIBRES OF THE MOTHERS MEMORY WERE STIRRED AND THE YOUNG MANWHOSE VOICE TOOK A GENTLER TONE WHEN HE SPOKE TO HER WAS ONE WITH THEBABE WHOM SHE HAD LOVED WITH A LOVE NEW TO HER BEFORE HE WAS BORN
I HAVE GOOD HOPE MRS
 VINCY LYDGATE WOULD SAY
 COME DOWN WITH MEAND LET US TALK ABOUT THE FOOD
 IN THAT WAY HE LED HER TO THE PARLORWHERE ROSAMOND WAS AND MADE A CHANGE FOR HER SURPRISING HER INTOTAKING SOME TEA OR BROTH WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR HER
 THERE WAS ACONSTANT UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN HIM AND ROSAMOND ON THESE MATTERS
 HEALMOST ALWAYS SAW HER BEFORE GOING TO THE SICKROOM AND SHE APPEALED TOHIM AS TO WHAT SHE COULD DO FOR MAMMA
 HER PRESENCE OF MIND ANDADROITNESS IN CARRYING OUT HIS HINTS WERE ADMIRABLE AND IT IS NOTWONDERFUL THAT THE IDEA OF SEEING ROSAMOND BEGAN TO MINGLE ITSELF WITHHIS INTEREST IN THE CASE
 ESPECIALLY WHEN THE CRITICAL STAGE WASPASSED AND HE BEGAN TO FEEL CONFIDENT OF FREDS RECOVERY
 IN THE MOREDOUBTFUL TIME HE HAD ADVISED CALLING IN DR
 SPRAGUE WHO IF HE COULDWOULD RATHER HAVE REMAINED NEUTRAL ON WRENCHS ACCOUNT BUT AFTER TWOCONSULTATIONS THE CONDUCT OF THE CASE WAS LEFT TO LYDGATE AND THEREWAS EVERY REASON TO MAKE HIM ASSIDUOUS
 MORNING AND EVENING HE WAS ATMR
 VINCYS AND GRADUALLY THE VISITS BECAME CHEERFUL AS FRED BECAMESIMPLY FEEBLE AND LAY NOT ONLY IN NEED OF THE UTMOST PETTING BUTCONSCIOUS OF IT SO THAT MRS
 VINCY FELT AS IF AFTER ALL THE ILLNESSHAD MADE A FESTIVAL FOR HER TENDERNESS
BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER HELD IT AN ADDED REASON FOR GOOD SPIRITS WHENOLD MR
 FEATHERSTONE SENT MESSAGES BY LYDGATE SAYING THAT FRED MUSTMAKE HASTE AND GET WELL AS HE PETER FEATHERSTONE COULD NOT DOWITHOUT HIM AND MISSED HIS VISITS SADLY
 THE OLD MAN HIMSELF WASGETTING BEDRIDDEN
 MRS
 VINCY TOLD THESE MESSAGES TO FRED WHEN HE COULDLISTEN AND HE TURNED TOWARDS HER HIS DELICATE PINCHED FACE FROMWHICH ALL THE THICK BLOND HAIR HAD BEEN CUT AWAY AND IN WHICH THE EYESSEEMED TO HAVE GOT LARGER YEARNING FOR SOME WORD ABOUT MARYWONDERINGWHAT SHE FELT ABOUT HIS ILLNESS
 NO WORD PASSED HIS LIPS BUT TO HEARWITH EYES BELONGS TO LOVES RARE WIT AND THE MOTHER IN THE FULNESS OFHER HEART NOT ONLY DIVINED FREDS LONGING BUT FELT READY FOR ANYSACRIFICE IN ORDER TO SATISFY HIM
IF I CAN ONLY SEE MY BOY STRONG AGAIN SHE SAID IN HER LOVING FOLLYAND WHO KNOWS
PERHAPS MASTER OF STONE COURT
 AND HE CAN MARRY ANYBODYHE LIKES THEN
NOT IF THEY WONT HAVE ME MOTHER SAID FRED
 THE ILLNESS HAD MADEHIM CHILDISH AND TEARS CAME AS HE SPOKE
OH TAKE A BIT OF JELLY MY DEAR SAID MRS
 VINCY SECRETLYINCREDULOUS OF ANY SUCH REFUSAL
SHE NEVER LEFT FREDS SIDE WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS NOT IN THE HOUSE ANDTHUS ROSAMOND WAS IN THE UNUSUAL POSITION OF BEING MUCH ALONE
 LYDGATENATURALLY NEVER THOUGHT OF STAYING LONG WITH HER YET IT SEEMED THATTHE BRIEF IMPERSONAL CONVERSATIONS THEY HAD TOGETHER WERE CREATING THATPECULIAR INTIMACY WHICH CONSISTS IN SHYNESS
 THEY WERE OBLIGED TO LOOKAT EACH OTHER IN SPEAKING AND SOMEHOW THE LOOKING COULD NOT BE CARRIEDTHROUGH AS THE MATTER OF COURSE WHICH IT REALLY WAS
 LYDGATE BEGAN TOFEEL THIS SORT OF CONSCIOUSNESS UNPLEASANT AND ONE DAY LOOKED DOWN ORANYWHERE LIKE AN ILLWORKED PUPPET
 BUT THIS TURNED OUT BADLY THENEXT DAY ROSAMOND LOOKED DOWN AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT WHEN THEIREYES MET AGAIN BOTH WERE MORE CONSCIOUS THAN BEFORE
 THERE WAS NO HELPFOR THIS IN SCIENCE AND AS LYDGATE DID NOT WANT TO FLIRT THERE SEEMEDTO BE NO HELP FOR IT IN FOLLY
 IT WAS THEREFORE A RELIEF WHEN NEIGHBORSNO LONGER CONSIDERED THE HOUSE IN QUARANTINE AND WHEN THE CHANCES OFSEEING ROSAMOND ALONE WERE VERY MUCH REDUCED
BUT THAT INTIMACY OF MUTUAL EMBARRASSMENT IN WHICH EACH FEELS THAT THEOTHER IS FEELING SOMETHING HAVING ONCE EXISTED ITS EFFECT IS NOT TOBE DONE AWAY WITH
 TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER AND OTHER WELLBRED TOPICS ISAPT TO SEEM A HOLLOW DEVICE AND BEHAVIOR CAN HARDLY BECOME EASY UNLESSIT FRANKLY RECOGNIZES A MUTUAL FASCINATIONWHICH OF COURSE NEED NOTMEAN ANYTHING DEEP OR SERIOUS
 THIS WAS THE WAY IN WHICH ROSAMOND ANDLYDGATE SLID GRACEFULLY INTO EASE AND MADE THEIR INTERCOURSE LIVELYAGAIN
 VISITORS CAME AND WENT AS USUAL THERE WAS ONCE MORE MUSIC INTHE DRAWINGROOM AND ALL THE EXTRA HOSPITALITY OF MR
 VINCYSMAYORALTY RETURNED
 LYDGATE WHENEVER HE COULD TOOK HIS SEAT BYROSAMONDS SIDE AND LINGERED TO HEAR HER MUSIC CALLING HIMSELF HERCAPTIVEMEANING ALL THE WHILE NOT TO BE HER CAPTIVE
 THEPREPOSTEROUSNESS OF THE NOTION THAT HE COULD AT ONCE SET UP ASATISFACTORY ESTABLISHMENT AS A MARRIED MAN WAS A SUFFICIENT GUARANTEEAGAINST DANGER
 THIS PLAY AT BEING A LITTLE IN LOVE WAS AGREEABLE ANDDID NOT INTERFERE WITH GRAVER PURSUITS
 FLIRTATION AFTER ALL WAS NOTNECESSARILY A SINGEING PROCESS
 ROSAMOND FOR HER PART HAD NEVERENJOYED THE DAYS SO MUCH IN HER LIFE BEFORE SHE WAS SURE OF BEINGADMIRED BY SOME ONE WORTH CAPTIVATING AND SHE DID NOT DISTINGUISHFLIRTATION FROM LOVE EITHER IN HERSELF OR IN ANOTHER
 SHE SEEMED TO BESAILING WITH A FAIR WIND JUST WHITHER SHE WOULD GO AND HER THOUGHTSWERE MUCH OCCUPIED WITH A HANDSOME HOUSE IN LOWICK GATE WHICH SHE HOPEDWOULD BYANDBY BE VACANT
 SHE WAS QUITE DETERMINED WHEN SHE WASMARRIED TO RID HERSELF ADROITLY OF ALL THE VISITORS WHO WERE NOTAGREEABLE TO HER AT HER FATHERS AND SHE IMAGINED THE DRAWINGROOM INHER FAVORITE HOUSE WITH VARIOUS STYLES OF FURNITURE
CERTAINLY HER THOUGHTS WERE MUCH OCCUPIED WITH LYDGATE HIMSELF HESEEMED TO HER ALMOST PERFECT IF HE HAD KNOWN HIS NOTES SO THAT HISENCHANTMENT UNDER HER MUSIC HAD BEEN LESS LIKE AN EMOTIONAL ELEPHANTSAND IF HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DISCRIMINATE BETTER THE REFINEMENTS OF HERTASTE IN DRESS SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE MENTIONED A DEFICIENCY IN HIM
HOW DIFFERENT HE WAS FROM YOUNG PLYMDALE OR MR
 CAIUS LARCHER
 THOSEYOUNG MEN HAD NOT A NOTION OF FRENCH AND COULD SPEAK ON NO SUBJECTWITH STRIKING KNOWLEDGE EXCEPT PERHAPS THE DYEING AND CARRYING TRADESWHICH OF COURSE THEY WERE ASHAMED TO MENTION THEY WERE MIDDLEMARCHGENTRY ELATED WITH THEIR SILVERHEADED WHIPS AND SATIN STOCKS BUTEMBARRASSED IN THEIR MANNERS AND TIMIDLY JOCOSE EVEN FRED WAS ABOVETHEM HAVING AT LEAST THE ACCENT AND MANNER OF A UNIVERSITY MAN
WHEREAS LYDGATE WAS ALWAYS LISTENED TO BORE HIMSELF WITH THE CARELESSPOLITENESS OF CONSCIOUS SUPERIORITY AND SEEMED TO HAVE THE RIGHTCLOTHES ON BY A CERTAIN NATURAL AFFINITY WITHOUT EVER HAVING TO THINKABOUT THEM
 ROSAMOND WAS PROUD WHEN HE ENTERED THE ROOM AND WHEN HEAPPROACHED HER WITH A DISTINGUISHING SMILE SHE HAD A DELICIOUS SENSETHAT SHE WAS THE OBJECT OF ENVIABLE HOMAGE
 IF LYDGATE HAD BEEN AWAREOF ALL THE PRIDE HE EXCITED IN THAT DELICATE BOSOM HE MIGHT HAVE BEENJUST AS WELL PLEASED AS ANY OTHER MAN EVEN THE MOST DENSELY IGNORANTOF HUMORAL PATHOLOGY OR FIBROUS TISSUE HE HELD IT ONE OF THE PRETTIESTATTITUDES OF THE FEMININE MIND TO ADORE A MANS PREEMINENCE WITHOUTTOO PRECISE A KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IT CONSISTED IN
 BUT ROSAMOND WAS NOTONE OF THOSE HELPLESS GIRLS WHO BETRAY THEMSELVES UNAWARES AND WHOSEBEHAVIOR IS AWKWARDLY DRIVEN BY THEIR IMPULSES INSTEAD OF BEINGSTEERED BY WARY GRACE AND PROPRIETY
 DO YOU IMAGINE THAT HER RAPIDFORECAST AND RUMINATION CONCERNING HOUSEFURNITURE AND SOCIETY WEREEVER DISCERNIBLE IN HER CONVERSATION EVEN WITH HER MAMMA
 ON THECONTRARY SHE WOULD HAVE EXPRESSED THE PRETTIEST SURPRISE ANDDISAPPROBATION IF SHE HAD HEARD THAT ANOTHER YOUNG LADY HAD BEENDETECTED IN THAT IMMODEST PREMATURENESSINDEED WOULD PROBABLY HAVEDISBELIEVED IN ITS POSSIBILITY
 FOR ROSAMOND NEVER SHOWED ANYUNBECOMING KNOWLEDGE AND WAS ALWAYS THAT COMBINATION OF CORRECTSENTIMENTS MUSIC DANCING DRAWING ELEGANT NOTEWRITING PRIVATEALBUM FOR EXTRACTED VERSE AND PERFECT BLOND LOVELINESS WHICH MADE THEIRRESISTIBLE WOMAN FOR THE DOOMED MAN OF THAT DATE
 THINK NO UNFAIREVIL OF HER PRAY SHE HAD NO WICKED PLOTS NOTHING SORDID ORMERCENARY IN FACT SHE NEVER THOUGHT OF MONEY EXCEPT AS SOMETHINGNECESSARY WHICH OTHER PEOPLE WOULD ALWAYS PROVIDE
 SHE WAS NOT IN THEHABIT OF DEVISING FALSEHOODS AND IF HER STATEMENTS WERE NO DIRECT CLEWTO FACT WHY THEY WERE NOT INTENDED IN THAT LIGHTTHEY WERE AMONG HERELEGANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS INTENDED TO PLEASE
 NATURE HAD INSPIRED MANYARTS IN FINISHING MRS
 LEMONS FAVORITE PUPIL WHO BY GENERAL CONSENTFREDS EXCEPTED WAS A RARE COMPOUND OF BEAUTY CLEVERNESS ANDAMIABILITY
LYDGATE FOUND IT MORE AND MORE AGREEABLE TO BE WITH HER AND THERE WASNO CONSTRAINT NOW THERE WAS A DELIGHTFUL INTERCHANGE OF INFLUENCE INTHEIR EYES AND WHAT THEY SAID HAD THAT SUPERFLUITY OF MEANING FORTHEM WHICH IS OBSERVABLE WITH SOME SENSE OF FLATNESS BY A THIRDPERSON STILL THEY HAD NO INTERVIEWS OR ASIDES FROM WHICH A THIRDPERSON NEED HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED
 IN FACT THEY FLIRTED AND LYDGATE WASSECURE IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY DID NOTHING ELSE
 IF A MAN COULD NOTLOVE AND BE WISE SURELY HE COULD FLIRT AND BE WISE AT THE SAME TIME
REALLY THE MEN IN MIDDLEMARCH EXCEPT MR
 FAREBROTHER WERE GREATBORES AND LYDGATE DID NOT CARE ABOUT COMMERCIAL POLITICS OR CARDSWHAT WAS HE TO DO FOR RELAXATION
 HE WAS OFTEN INVITED TO THEBULSTRODES BUT THE GIRLS THERE WERE HARDLY OUT OF THE SCHOOLROOM ANDMRS
 BULSTRODES NAIVE WAY OF CONCILIATING PIETY AND WORLDLINESS THENOTHINGNESS OF THIS LIFE AND THE DESIRABILITY OF CUT GLASS THECONSCIOUSNESS AT ONCE OF FILTHY RAGS AND THE BEST DAMASK WAS NOT ASUFFICIENT RELIEF FROM THE WEIGHT OF HER HUSBANDS INVARIABLESERIOUSNESS
 THE VINCYS HOUSE WITH ALL ITS FAULTS WAS THE PLEASANTERBY CONTRAST BESIDES IT NOURISHED ROSAMONDSWEET TO LOOK AT AS AHALFOPENED BLUSHROSE AND ADORNED WITH ACCOMPLISHMENTS FOR THEREFINED AMUSEMENT OF MAN
BUT HE MADE SOME ENEMIES OTHER THAN MEDICAL BY HIS SUCCESS WITH MISSVINCY
 ONE EVENING HE CAME INTO THE DRAWINGROOM RATHER LATE WHENSEVERAL OTHER VISITORS WERE THERE
 THE CARDTABLE HAD DRAWN OFF THEELDERS AND MR
 NED PLYMDALE ONE OF THE GOOD MATCHES IN MIDDLEMARCHTHOUGH NOT ONE OF ITS LEADING MINDS WAS IN TÊTEÀTÊTE WITHROSAMOND
 HE HAD BROUGHT THE LAST KEEPSAKE THE GORGEOUS WATEREDSILKPUBLICATION WHICH MARKED MODERN PROGRESS AT THAT TIME AND HECONSIDERED HIMSELF VERY FORTUNATE THAT HE COULD BE THE FIRST TO LOOKOVER IT WITH HER DWELLING ON THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WITH SHINYCOPPERPLATE CHEEKS AND COPPERPLATE SMILES AND POINTING TO COMICVERSES AS CAPITAL AND SENTIMENTAL STORIES AS INTERESTING
 ROSAMOND WASGRACIOUS AND MR
 NED WAS SATISFIED THAT HE HAD THE VERY BEST THING INART AND LITERATURE AS A MEDIUM FOR PAYING ADDRESSESTHE VERY THING TOPLEASE A NICE GIRL
 HE HAD ALSO REASONS DEEP RATHER THAN OSTENSIBLEFOR BEING SATISFIED WITH HIS OWN APPEARANCE
 TO SUPERFICIAL OBSERVERSHIS CHIN HAD TOO VANISHING AN ASPECT LOOKING AS IF IT WERE BEINGGRADUALLY REABSORBED
 AND IT DID INDEED CAUSE HIM SOME DIFFICULTY ABOUTTHE FIT OF HIS SATIN STOCKS FOR WHICH CHINS WERE AT THAT TIME USEFUL
I THINK THE HONORABLE MRS
 S
 IS SOMETHING LIKE YOU SAID MR
 NED
 HEKEPT THE BOOK OPEN AT THE BEWITCHING PORTRAIT AND LOOKED AT IT RATHERLANGUISHINGLY
HER BACK IS VERY LARGE SHE SEEMS TO HAVE SAT FOR THAT SAIDROSAMOND NOT MEANING ANY SATIRE BUT THINKING HOW RED YOUNG PLYMDALESHANDS WERE AND WONDERING WHY LYDGATE DID NOT COME
 SHE WENT ON WITHHER TATTING ALL THE WHILE
I DID NOT SAY SHE WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOU ARE SAID MR
 NEDVENTURING TO LOOK FROM THE PORTRAIT TO ITS RIVAL
I SUSPECT YOU OF BEING AN ADROIT FLATTERER SAID ROSAMOND FEELINGSURE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE TO REJECT THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN A SECOND TIME
BUT NOW LYDGATE CAME IN THE BOOK WAS CLOSED BEFORE HE REACHEDROSAMONDS CORNER AND AS HE TOOK HIS SEAT WITH EASY CONFIDENCE ON THEOTHER SIDE OF HER YOUNG PLYMDALES JAW FELL LIKE A BAROMETER TOWARDSTHE CHEERLESS SIDE OF CHANGE
 ROSAMOND ENJOYED NOT ONLY LYDGATESPRESENCE BUT ITS EFFECT SHE LIKED TO EXCITE JEALOUSY
WHAT A LATE COMER YOU ARE
 SHE SAID AS THEY SHOOK HANDS
 MAMMA HADGIVEN YOU UP A LITTLE WHILE AGO
 HOW DO YOU FIND FRED
AS USUAL GOING ON WELL BUT SLOWLY
 I WANT HIM TO GO AWAYTO STONECOURT FOR EXAMPLE
 BUT YOUR MAMMA SEEMS TO HAVE SOME OBJECTION
POOR FELLOW
 SAID ROSAMOND PRETTILY
 YOU WILL SEE FRED SO CHANGEDSHE ADDED TURNING TO THE OTHER SUITOR WE HAVE LOOKED TO MR
 LYDGATEAS OUR GUARDIAN ANGEL DURING THIS ILLNESS
MR
 NED SMILED NERVOUSLY WHILE LYDGATE DRAWING THE KEEPSAKE TOWARDSHIM AND OPENING IT GAVE A SHORT SCORNFUL LAUGH AND TOSSED UP HIS CHINAS IF IN WONDERMENT AT HUMAN FOLLY
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT SO PROFANELY
 SAID ROSAMOND WITH BLANDNEUTRALITY
I WONDER WHICH WOULD TURN OUT TO BE THE SILLIESTTHE ENGRAVINGS OR THEWRITING HERE SAID LYDGATE IN HIS MOST CONVINCED TONE WHILE HETURNED OVER THE PAGES QUICKLY SEEMING TO SEE ALL THROUGH THE BOOK INNO TIME AND SHOWING HIS LARGE WHITE HANDS TO MUCH ADVANTAGE ASROSAMOND THOUGHT
 DO LOOK AT THIS BRIDEGROOM COMING OUT OF CHURCH DIDYOU EVER SEE SUCH A SUGARED INVENTIONAS THE ELIZABETHANS USED TOSAY
 DID ANY HABERDASHER EVER LOOK SO SMIRKING
 YET I WILL ANSWER FORIT THE STORY MAKES HIM ONE OF THE FIRST GENTLEMEN IN THE LAND
YOU ARE SO SEVERE I AM FRIGHTENED AT YOU SAID ROSAMOND KEEPING HERAMUSEMENT DULY MODERATE
 POOR YOUNG PLYMDALE HAD LINGERED WITHADMIRATION OVER THIS VERY ENGRAVING AND HIS SPIRIT WAS STIRRED
THERE ARE A GREAT MANY CELEBRATED PEOPLE WRITING IN THE KEEPSAKE ATALL EVENTS HE SAID IN A TONE AT ONCE PIQUED AND TIMID
 THIS IS THEFIRST TIME I HAVE HEARD IT CALLED SILLY
I THINK I SHALL TURN ROUND ON YOU AND ACCUSE YOU OF BEING A GOTHSAID ROSAMOND LOOKING AT LYDGATE WITH A SMILE
 I SUSPECT YOU KNOWNOTHING ABOUT LADY BLESSINGTON AND L
 E
 L
 ROSAMOND HERSELF WAS NOTWITHOUT RELISH FOR THESE WRITERS BUT SHE DID NOT READILY COMMITHERSELF BY ADMIRATION AND WAS ALIVE TO THE SLIGHTEST HINT THATANYTHING WAS NOT ACCORDING TO LYDGATE IN THE VERY HIGHEST TASTE
BUT SIR WALTER SCOTTI SUPPOSE MR
 LYDGATE KNOWS HIM SAID YOUNGPLYMDALE A LITTLE CHEERED BY THIS ADVANTAGE
OH I READ NO LITERATURE NOW SAID LYDGATE SHUTTING THE BOOK ANDPUSHING IT AWAY
 I READ SO MUCH WHEN I WAS A LAD THAT I SUPPOSE ITWILL LAST ME ALL MY LIFE
 I USED TO KNOW SCOTTS POEMS BY HEART
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHEN YOU LEFT OFF SAID ROSAMOND BECAUSE THENI MIGHT BE SURE THAT I KNEW SOMETHING WHICH YOU DID NOT KNOW
MR
 LYDGATE WOULD SAY THAT WAS NOT WORTH KNOWING SAID MR
 NEDPURPOSELY CAUSTIC
ON THE CONTRARY SAID LYDGATE SHOWING NO SMART BUT SMILING WITHEXASPERATING CONFIDENCE AT ROSAMOND
 IT WOULD BE WORTH KNOWING BY THEFACT THAT MISS VINCY COULD TELL IT ME
YOUNG PLYMDALE SOON WENT TO LOOK AT THE WHISTPLAYING THINKING THATLYDGATE WAS ONE OF THE MOST CONCEITED UNPLEASANT FELLOWS IT HAD EVERBEEN HIS ILLFORTUNE TO MEET
HOW RASH YOU ARE
 SAID ROSAMOND INWARDLY DELIGHTED
 DO YOU SEE THATYOU HAVE GIVEN OFFENCE
WHAT
 IS IT MR
 PLYMDALES BOOK
 I AM SORRY
 I DIDNT THINK ABOUT IT
I SHALL BEGIN TO ADMIT WHAT YOU SAID OF YOURSELF WHEN YOU FIRST CAMEHERETHAT YOU ARE A BEAR AND WANT TEACHING BY THE BIRDS
WELL THERE IS A BIRD WHO CAN TEACH ME WHAT SHE WILL
 DONT I LISTENTO HER WILLINGLY
TO ROSAMOND IT SEEMED AS IF SHE AND LYDGATE WERE AS GOOD AS ENGAGED
THAT THEY WERE SOME TIME TO BE ENGAGED HAD LONG BEEN AN IDEA IN HERMIND AND IDEAS WE KNOW TEND TO A MORE SOLID KIND OF EXISTENCE THENECESSARY MATERIALS BEING AT HAND
 IT IS TRUE LYDGATE HAD THECOUNTERIDEA OF REMAINING UNENGAGED BUT THIS WAS A MERE NEGATIVE ASHADOW CAST BY OTHER RESOLVES WHICH THEMSELVES WERE CAPABLE OFSHRINKING
 CIRCUMSTANCE WAS ALMOST SURE TO BE ON THE SIDE OF ROSAMONDSIDEA WHICH HAD A SHAPING ACTIVITY AND LOOKED THROUGH WATCHFUL BLUEEYES WHEREAS LYDGATES LAY BLIND AND UNCONCERNED AS A JELLYFISH WHICHGETS MELTED WITHOUT KNOWING IT
THAT EVENING WHEN HE WENT HOME HE LOOKED AT HIS PHIALS TO SEE HOW APROCESS OF MACERATION WAS GOING ON WITH UNDISTURBED INTEREST AND HEWROTE OUT HIS DAILY NOTES WITH AS MUCH PRECISION AS USUAL
 THE REVERIESFROM WHICH IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO DETACH HIMSELF WERE IDEALCONSTRUCTIONS OF SOMETHING ELSE THAN ROSAMONDS VIRTUES AND THEPRIMITIVE TISSUE WAS STILL HIS FAIR UNKNOWN
 MOREOVER HE WAS BEGINNINGTO FEEL SOME ZEST FOR THE GROWING THOUGH HALFSUPPRESSED FEUD BETWEENHIM AND THE OTHER MEDICAL MEN WHICH WAS LIKELY TO BECOME MOREMANIFEST NOW THAT BULSTRODES METHOD OF MANAGING THE NEW HOSPITAL WASABOUT TO BE DECLARED AND THERE WERE VARIOUS INSPIRITING SIGNS THAT HISNONACCEPTANCE BY SOME OF PEACOCKS PATIENTS MIGHT BE COUNTERBALANCEDBY THE IMPRESSION HE HAD PRODUCED IN OTHER QUARTERS
 ONLY A FEW DAYSLATER WHEN HE HAD HAPPENED TO OVERTAKE ROSAMOND ON THE LOWICK ROAD ANDHAD GOT DOWN FROM HIS HORSE TO WALK BY HER SIDE UNTIL HE HAD QUITEPROTECTED HER FROM A PASSING DROVE HE HAD BEEN STOPPED BY A SERVANT ONHORSEBACK WITH A MESSAGE CALLING HIM IN TO A HOUSE OF SOME IMPORTANCEWHERE PEACOCK HAD NEVER ATTENDED AND IT WAS THE SECOND INSTANCE OFTHIS KIND
 THE SERVANT WAS SIR JAMES CHETTAMS AND THE HOUSE WASLOWICK MANOR

MR
 AND MRS
 CASAUBON RETURNING FROM THEIR WEDDING JOURNEY ARRIVED ATLOWICK MANOR IN THE MIDDLE OF JANUARY
 A LIGHT SNOW WAS FALLING AS THEYDESCENDED AT THE DOOR AND IN THE MORNING WHEN DOROTHEA PASSED FROMHER DRESSINGROOM INTO THE BLUEGREEN BOUDOIR THAT WE KNOW OF SHE SAWTHE LONG AVENUE OF LIMES LIFTING THEIR TRUNKS FROM A WHITE EARTH ANDSPREADING WHITE BRANCHES AGAINST THE DUN AND MOTIONLESS SKY
 THEDISTANT FLAT SHRANK IN UNIFORM WHITENESS AND LOWHANGING UNIFORMITY OFCLOUD
 THE VERY FURNITURE IN THE ROOM SEEMED TO HAVE SHRUNK SINCE SHESAW IT BEFORE THE STAG IN THE TAPESTRY LOOKED MORE LIKE A GHOST IN HISGHOSTLY BLUEGREEN WORLD THE VOLUMES OF POLITE LITERATURE IN THEBOOKCASE LOOKED MORE LIKE IMMOVABLE IMITATIONS OF BOOKS
 THE BRIGHTFIRE OF DRY OAKBOUGHS BURNING ON THE LOGS SEEMED AN INCONGRUOUSRENEWAL OF LIFE AND GLOWLIKE THE FIGURE OF DOROTHEA HERSELF AS SHEENTERED CARRYING THE REDLEATHER CASES CONTAINING THE CAMEOS FOR CELIA
SHE WAS GLOWING FROM HER MORNING TOILET AS ONLY HEALTHFUL YOUTH CANGLOW THERE WAS GEMLIKE BRIGHTNESS ON HER COILED HAIR AND IN HER HAZELEYES THERE WAS WARM RED LIFE IN HER LIPS HER THROAT HAD A BREATHINGWHITENESS ABOVE THE DIFFERING WHITE OF THE FUR WHICH ITSELF SEEMED TOWIND ABOUT HER NECK AND CLING DOWN HER BLUEGRAY PELISSE WITH ATENDERNESS GATHERED FROM HER OWN A SENTIENT COMMINGLED INNOCENCE WHICHKEPT ITS LOVELINESS AGAINST THE CRYSTALLINE PURITY OF THE OUTDOOR SNOW
AS SHE LAID THE CAMEOCASES ON THE TABLE IN THE BOWWINDOW SHEUNCONSCIOUSLY KEPT HER HANDS ON THEM IMMEDIATELY ABSORBED IN LOOKINGOUT ON THE STILL WHITE ENCLOSURE WHICH MADE HER VISIBLE WORLD
MR
 CASAUBON WHO HAD RISEN EARLY COMPLAINING OF PALPITATION WAS INTHE LIBRARY GIVING AUDIENCE TO HIS CURATE MR
 TUCKER
 BYANDBY CELIAWOULD COME IN HER QUALITY OF BRIDESMAID AS WELL AS SISTER AND THROUGHTHE NEXT WEEKS THERE WOULD BE WEDDING VISITS RECEIVED AND GIVEN ALL INCONTINUANCE OF THAT TRANSITIONAL LIFE UNDERSTOOD TO CORRESPOND WITH THEEXCITEMENT OF BRIDAL FELICITY AND KEEPING UP THE SENSE OF BUSYINEFFECTIVENESS AS OF A DREAM WHICH THE DREAMER BEGINS TO SUSPECT
 THEDUTIES OF HER MARRIED LIFE CONTEMPLATED AS SO GREAT BEFOREHAND SEEMEDTO BE SHRINKING WITH THE FURNITURE AND THE WHITE VAPORWALLEDLANDSCAPE
 THE CLEAR HEIGHTS WHERE SHE EXPECTED TO WALK IN FULLCOMMUNION HAD BECOME DIFFICULT TO SEE EVEN IN HER IMAGINATION THEDELICIOUS REPOSE OF THE SOUL ON A COMPLETE SUPERIOR HAD BEEN SHAKENINTO UNEASY EFFORT AND ALARMED WITH DIM PRESENTIMENT
 WHEN WOULD THEDAYS BEGIN OF THAT ACTIVE WIFELY DEVOTION WHICH WAS TO STRENGTHEN HERHUSBANDS LIFE AND EXALT HER OWN
 NEVER PERHAPS AS SHE HADPRECONCEIVED THEM BUT SOMEHOWSTILL SOMEHOW
 IN THIS SOLEMNLY PLEDGEDUNION OF HER LIFE DUTY WOULD PRESENT ITSELF IN SOME NEW FORM OFINSPIRATION AND GIVE A NEW MEANING TO WIFELY LOVE
MEANWHILE THERE WAS THE SNOW AND THE LOW ARCH OF DUN VAPORTHERE WASTHE STIFLING OPPRESSION OF THAT GENTLEWOMANS WORLD WHERE EVERYTHINGWAS DONE FOR HER AND NONE ASKED FOR HER AIDWHERE THE SENSE OFCONNECTION WITH A MANIFOLD PREGNANT EXISTENCE HAD TO BE KEPT UPPAINFULLY AS AN INWARD VISION INSTEAD OF COMING FROM WITHOUT IN CLAIMSTHAT WOULD HAVE SHAPED HER ENERGIES
 WHAT SHALL I DO
 WHATEVER YOUPLEASE MY DEAR THAT HAD BEEN HER BRIEF HISTORY SINCE SHE HAD LEFTOFF LEARNING MORNING LESSONS AND PRACTISING SILLY RHYTHMS ON THE HATEDPIANO
 MARRIAGE WHICH WAS TO BRING GUIDANCE INTO WORTHY AND IMPERATIVEOCCUPATION HAD NOT YET FREED HER FROM THE GENTLEWOMANS OPPRESSIVELIBERTY IT HAD NOT EVEN FILLED HER LEISURE WITH THE RUMINANT JOY OFUNCHECKED TENDERNESS
 HER BLOOMING FULLPULSED YOUTH STOOD THERE IN AMORAL IMPRISONMENT WHICH MADE ITSELF ONE WITH THE CHILL COLORLESSNARROWED LANDSCAPE WITH THE SHRUNKEN FURNITURE THE NEVERREAD BOOKSAND THE GHOSTLY STAG IN A PALE FANTASTIC WORLD THAT SEEMED TO BEVANISHING FROM THE DAYLIGHT
IN THE FIRST MINUTES WHEN DOROTHEA LOOKED OUT SHE FELT NOTHING BUT THEDREARY OPPRESSION THEN CAME A KEEN REMEMBRANCE AND TURNING AWAY FROMTHE WINDOW SHE WALKED ROUND THE ROOM
 THE IDEAS AND HOPES WHICH WERELIVING IN HER MIND WHEN SHE FIRST SAW THIS ROOM NEARLY THREE MONTHSBEFORE WERE PRESENT NOW ONLY AS MEMORIES SHE JUDGED THEM AS WE JUDGETRANSIENT AND DEPARTED THINGS
 ALL EXISTENCE SEEMED TO BEAT WITH ALOWER PULSE THAN HER OWN AND HER RELIGIOUS FAITH WAS A SOLITARY CRYTHE STRUGGLE OUT OF A NIGHTMARE IN WHICH EVERY OBJECT WAS WITHERING ANDSHRINKING AWAY FROM HER
 EACH REMEMBERED THING IN THE ROOM WASDISENCHANTED WAS DEADENED AS AN UNLIT TRANSPARENCY TILL HER WANDERINGGAZE CAME TO THE GROUP OF MINIATURES AND THERE AT LAST SHE SAWSOMETHING WHICH HAD GATHERED NEW BREATH AND MEANING IT WAS THEMINIATURE OF MR
 CASAUBONS AUNT JULIA WHO HAD MADE THE UNFORTUNATEMARRIAGEOF WILL LADISLAWS GRANDMOTHER
 DOROTHEA COULD FANCY THAT ITWAS ALIVE NOWTHE DELICATE WOMANS FACE WHICH YET HAD A HEADSTRONGLOOK A PECULIARITY DIFFICULT TO INTERPRET
 WAS IT ONLY HER FRIENDS WHOTHOUGHT HER MARRIAGE UNFORTUNATE
 OR DID SHE HERSELF FIND IT OUT TO BEA MISTAKE AND TASTE THE SALT BITTERNESS OF HER TEARS IN THE MERCIFULSILENCE OF THE NIGHT
 WHAT BREADTHS OF EXPERIENCE DOROTHEA SEEMED TOHAVE PASSED OVER SINCE SHE FIRST LOOKED AT THIS MINIATURE
 SHE FELT ANEW COMPANIONSHIP WITH IT AS IF IT HAD AN EAR FOR HER AND COULD SEEHOW SHE WAS LOOKING AT IT
 HERE WAS A WOMAN WHO HAD KNOWN SOMEDIFFICULTY ABOUT MARRIAGE
 NAY THE COLORS DEEPENED THE LIPS AND CHINSEEMED TO GET LARGER THE HAIR AND EYES SEEMED TO BE SENDING OUT LIGHTTHE FACE WAS MASCULINE AND BEAMED ON HER WITH THAT FULL GAZE WHICHTELLS HER ON WHOM IT FALLS THAT SHE IS TOO INTERESTING FOR THESLIGHTEST MOVEMENT OF HER EYELID TO PASS UNNOTICED AND UNINTERPRETED
THE VIVID PRESENTATION CAME LIKE A PLEASANT GLOW TO DOROTHEA SHE FELTHERSELF SMILING AND TURNING FROM THE MINIATURE SAT DOWN AND LOOKED UPAS IF SHE WERE AGAIN TALKING TO A FIGURE IN FRONT OF HER
 BUT THE SMILEDISAPPEARED AS SHE WENT ON MEDITATING AND AT LAST SHE SAID ALOUDOH IT WAS CRUEL TO SPEAK SO
 HOW SADHOW DREADFUL
SHE ROSE QUICKLY AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM HURRYING ALONG THE CORRIDORWITH THE IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE TO GO AND SEE HER HUSBAND AND INQUIRE IFSHE COULD DO ANYTHING FOR HIM
 PERHAPS MR
 TUCKER WAS GONE AND MR
CASAUBON WAS ALONE IN THE LIBRARY
 SHE FELT AS IF ALL HER MORNINGSGLOOM WOULD VANISH IF SHE COULD SEE HER HUSBAND GLAD BECAUSE OF HERPRESENCE
BUT WHEN SHE REACHED THE HEAD OF THE DARK OAK THERE WAS CELIA COMINGUP AND BELOW THERE WAS MR
 BROOKE EXCHANGING WELCOMES ANDCONGRATULATIONS WITH MR
 CASAUBON
DODO
 SAID CELIA IN HER QUIET STACCATO THEN KISSED HER SISTERWHOSE ARMS ENCIRCLED HER AND SAID NO MORE
 I THINK THEY BOTH CRIED ALITTLE IN A FURTIVE MANNER WHILE DOROTHEA RAN DOWNSTAIRS TO GREET HERUNCLE
I NEED NOT ASK HOW YOU ARE MY DEAR SAID MR
 BROOKE AFTER KISSINGHER FOREHEAD
 ROME HAS AGREED WITH YOU I SEEHAPPINESS FRESCOS THEANTIQUETHAT SORT OF THING
 WELL ITS VERY PLEASANT TO HAVE YOU BACKAGAIN AND YOU UNDERSTAND ALL ABOUT ART NOW EH
 BUT CASAUBON IS ALITTLE PALE I TELL HIMA LITTLE PALE YOU KNOW
 STUDYING HARD IN HISHOLIDAYS IS CARRYING IT RATHER TOO FAR
 I OVERDID IT AT ONE TIMEMR
BROOKE STILL HELD DOROTHEAS HAND BUT HAD TURNED HIS FACE TO MR
CASAUBONABOUT TOPOGRAPHY RUINS TEMPLESI THOUGHT I HAD A CLEW BUTI SAW IT WOULD CARRY ME TOO FAR AND NOTHING MIGHT COME OF IT
 YOU MAYGO ANY LENGTH IN THAT SORT OF THING AND NOTHING MAY COME OF IT YOUKNOW
DOROTHEAS EYES ALSO WERE TURNED UP TO HER HUSBANDS FACE WITH SOMEANXIETY AT THE IDEA THAT THOSE WHO SAW HIM AFRESH AFTER ABSENCE MIGHTBE AWARE OF SIGNS WHICH SHE HAD NOT NOTICED
NOTHING TO ALARM YOU MY DEAR SAID MR
 BROOKE OBSERVING HEREXPRESSION
 A LITTLE ENGLISH BEEF AND MUTTON WILL SOON MAKE ADIFFERENCE
 IT WAS ALL VERY WELL TO LOOK PALE SITTING FOR THE PORTRAITOF AQUINAS YOU KNOWWE GOT YOUR LETTER JUST IN TIME
 BUT AQUINASNOWHE WAS A LITTLE TOO SUBTLE WASNT HE
 DOES ANYBODY READ AQUINAS
HE IS NOT INDEED AN AUTHOR ADAPTED TO SUPERFICIAL MINDS SAID MR
CASAUBON MEETING THESE TIMELY QUESTIONS WITH DIGNIFIED PATIENCE
YOU WOULD LIKE COFFEE IN YOUR OWN ROOM UNCLE
 SAID DOROTHEA COMINGTO THE RESCUE
YES AND YOU MUST GO TO CELIA SHE HAS GREAT NEWS TO TELL YOU YOUKNOW
 I LEAVE IT ALL TO HER
THE BLUEGREEN BOUDOIR LOOKED MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN CELIA WAS SEATEDTHERE IN A PELISSE EXACTLY LIKE HER SISTERS SURVEYING THE CAMEOS WITHA PLACID SATISFACTION WHILE THE CONVERSATION PASSED ON TO OTHERTOPICS
DO YOU THINK IT NICE TO GO TO ROME ON A WEDDING JOURNEY
 SAID CELIAWITH HER READY DELICATE BLUSH WHICH DOROTHEA WAS USED TO ON THESMALLEST OCCASIONS
IT WOULD NOT SUIT ALLNOT YOU DEAR FOR EXAMPLE SAID DOROTHEAQUIETLY
 NO ONE WOULD EVER KNOW WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF A WEDDING JOURNEYTO ROME
MRS
 CADWALLADER SAYS IT IS NONSENSE PEOPLE GOING A LONG JOURNEY WHENTHEY ARE MARRIED
 SHE SAYS THEY GET TIRED TO DEATH OF EACH OTHER ANDCANT QUARREL COMFORTABLY AS THEY WOULD AT HOME
 AND LADY CHETTAM SAYSSHE WENT TO BATH
 CELIAS COLOR CHANGED AGAIN AND AGAINSEEMEDTO COME AND GO WITH TIDINGS FROM THE HEARTAS IT A RUNNING MESSENGER HAD BEEN
IT MUST MEAN MORE THAN CELIAS BLUSHING USUALLY DID
CELIA
 HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED
 SAID DOROTHEA IN A TONE FULL OFSISTERLY FEELING
 HAVE YOU REALLY ANY GREAT NEWS TO TELL ME
IT WAS BECAUSE YOU WENT AWAY DODO
 THEN THERE WAS NOBODY BUT ME FORSIR JAMES TO TALK TO SAID CELIA WITH A CERTAIN ROGUISHNESS IN HEREYES
I UNDERSTAND
 IT IS AS I USED TO HOPE AND BELIEVE SAID DOROTHEATAKING HER SISTERS FACE BETWEEN HER HANDS AND LOOKING AT HER HALFANXIOUSLY
 CELIAS MARRIAGE SEEMED MORE SERIOUS THAN IT USED TO DO
IT WAS ONLY THREE DAYS AGO SAID CELIA
 AND LADY CHETTAM IS VERYKIND
AND YOU ARE VERY HAPPY
YES
 WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE MARRIED YET
 BECAUSE EVERY THING IS TO BEGOT READY
 AND I DONT WANT TO BE MARRIED SO VERY SOON BECAUSE I THINKIT IS NICE TO BE ENGAGED
 AND WE SHALL BE MARRIED ALL OUR LIVES AFTER
I DO BELIEVE YOU COULD NOT MARRY BETTER KITTY
 SIR JAMES IS A GOODHONORABLE MAN SAID DOROTHEA WARMLY
HE HAS GONE ON WITH THE COTTAGES DODO
 HE WILL TELL YOU ABOUT THEMWHEN HE COMES
 SHALL YOU BE GLAD TO SEE HIM
OF COURSE I SHALL
 HOW CAN YOU ASK ME
ONLY I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULD BE GETTING SO LEARNED SAID CELIAREGARDING MR
 CASAUBONS LEARNING AS A KIND OF DAMP WHICH MIGHT IN DUETIME SATURATE A NEIGHBORING BODY
CHAPTER XXIX
I FOUND THAT NO GENIUS IN ANOTHER COULD PLEASE ME
 MY UNFORTUNATEPARADOXES HAD ENTIRELY DRIED UP THAT SOURCE OF COMFORT
GOLDSMITH
ONE MORNING SOME WEEKS AFTER HER ARRIVAL AT LOWICK DOROTHEABUT WHYALWAYS DOROTHEA
 WAS HER POINT OF VIEW THE ONLY POSSIBLE ONE WITHREGARD TO THIS MARRIAGE
 I PROTEST AGAINST ALL OUR INTEREST ALL OUREFFORT AT UNDERSTANDING BEING GIVEN TO THE YOUNG SKINS THAT LOOKBLOOMING IN SPITE OF TROUBLE FOR THESE TOO WILL GET FADED AND WILLKNOW THE OLDER AND MORE EATING GRIEFS WHICH WE ARE HELPING TO NEGLECT
IN SPITE OF THE BLINKING EYES AND WHITE MOLES OBJECTIONABLE TO CELIAAND THE WANT OF MUSCULAR CURVE WHICH WAS MORALLY PAINFUL TO SIR JAMESMR
 CASAUBON HAD AN INTENSE CONSCIOUSNESS WITHIN HIM AND WASSPIRITUALLY AHUNGERED LIKE THE REST OF US
 HE HAD DONE NOTHINGEXCEPTIONAL IN MARRYINGNOTHING BUT WHAT SOCIETY SANCTIONS ANDCONSIDERS AN OCCASION FOR WREATHS AND BOUQUETS
 IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIMTHAT HE MUST NOT ANY LONGER DEFER HIS INTENTION OF MATRIMONY AND HEHAD REFLECTED THAT IN TAKING A WIFE A MAN OF GOOD POSITION SHOULDEXPECT AND CAREFULLY CHOOSE A BLOOMING YOUNG LADYTHE YOUNGER THEBETTER BECAUSE MORE EDUCABLE AND SUBMISSIVEOF A RANK EQUAL TO HISOWN OF RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES VIRTUOUS DISPOSITION AND GOODUNDERSTANDING
 ON SUCH A YOUNG LADY HE WOULD MAKE HANDSOME SETTLEMENTSAND HE WOULD NEGLECT NO ARRANGEMENT FOR HER HAPPINESS IN RETURN HESHOULD RECEIVE FAMILY PLEASURES AND LEAVE BEHIND HIM THAT COPY OFHIMSELF WHICH SEEMED SO URGENTLY REQUIRED OF A MANTO THE SONNETEERS OFTHE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
 TIMES HAD ALTERED SINCE THEN AND NO SONNETEERHAD INSISTED ON MR
 CASAUBONS LEAVING A COPY OF HIMSELF MOREOVER HEHAD NOT YET SUCCEEDED IN ISSUING COPIES OF HIS MYTHOLOGICAL KEY BUT HEHAD ALWAYS INTENDED TO ACQUIT HIMSELF BY MARRIAGE AND THE SENSE THATHE WAS FAST LEAVING THE YEARS BEHIND HIM THAT THE WORLD WAS GETTINGDIMMER AND THAT HE FELT LONELY WAS A REASON TO HIM FOR LOSING NO MORETIME IN OVERTAKING DOMESTIC DELIGHTS BEFORE THEY TOO WERE LEFT BEHINDBY THE YEARS
AND WHEN HE HAD SEEN DOROTHEA HE BELIEVED THAT HE HAD FOUND EVEN MORETHAN HE DEMANDED SHE MIGHT REALLY BE SUCH A HELPMATE TO HIM AS WOULDENABLE HIM TO DISPENSE WITH A HIRED SECRETARY AN AID WHICH MR
CASAUBON HAD NEVER YET EMPLOYED AND HAD A SUSPICIOUS DREAD OF
 MR
CASAUBON WAS NERVOUSLY CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS EXPECTED TO MANIFEST APOWERFUL MIND
 PROVIDENCE IN ITS KINDNESS HAD SUPPLIED HIM WITH THEWIFE HE NEEDED
 A WIFE A MODEST YOUNG LADY WITH THE PURELYAPPRECIATIVE UNAMBITIOUS ABILITIES OF HER SEX IS SURE TO THINK HERHUSBANDS MIND POWERFUL
 WHETHER PROVIDENCE HAD TAKEN EQUAL CARE OFMISS BROOKE IN PRESENTING HER WITH MR
 CASAUBON WAS AN IDEA WHICH COULDHARDLY OCCUR TO HIM
 SOCIETY NEVER MADE THE PREPOSTEROUS DEMAND THAT AMAN SHOULD THINK AS MUCH ABOUT HIS OWN QUALIFICATIONS FOR MAKING ACHARMING GIRL HAPPY AS HE THINKS OF HERS FOR MAKING HIMSELF HAPPY
 ASIF A MAN COULD CHOOSE NOT ONLY HIS WIFE BUT HIS WIFES HUSBAND
 OR ASIF HE WERE BOUND TO PROVIDE CHARMS FOR HIS POSTERITY IN HIS OWNPERSON
 WHEN DOROTHEA ACCEPTED HIM WITH EFFUSION THAT WAS ONLYNATURAL AND MR
 CASAUBON BELIEVED THAT HIS HAPPINESS WAS GOING TOBEGIN
HE HAD NOT HAD MUCH FORETASTE OF HAPPINESS IN HIS PREVIOUS LIFE
 TOKNOW INTENSE JOY WITHOUT A STRONG BODILY FRAME ONE MUST HAVE ANENTHUSIASTIC SOUL
 MR
 CASAUBON HAD NEVER HAD A STRONG BODILY FRAMEAND HIS SOUL WAS SENSITIVE WITHOUT BEING ENTHUSIASTIC IT WAS TOOLANGUID TO THRILL OUT OF SELFCONSCIOUSNESS INTO PASSIONATE DELIGHT ITWENT ON FLUTTERING IN THE SWAMPY GROUND WHERE IT WAS HATCHED THINKINGOF ITS WINGS AND NEVER FLYING
 HIS EXPERIENCE WAS OF THAT PITIABLE KINDWHICH SHRINKS FROM PITY AND FEARS MOST OF ALL THAT IT SHOULD BE KNOWNIT WAS THAT PROUD NARROW SENSITIVENESS WHICH HAS NOT MASS ENOUGH TOSPARE FOR TRANSFORMATION INTO SYMPATHY AND QUIVERS THREADLIKE INSMALL CURRENTS OF SELFPREOCCUPATION OR AT BEST OF AN EGOISTICSCRUPULOSITY
 AND MR
 CASAUBON HAD MANY SCRUPLES HE WAS CAPABLE OF ASEVERE SELFRESTRAINT HE WAS RESOLUTE IN BEING A MAN OF HONORACCORDING TO THE CODE HE WOULD BE UNIMPEACHABLE BY ANY RECOGNIZEDOPINION
 IN CONDUCT THESE ENDS HAD BEEN ATTAINED BUT THE DIFFICULTY OFMAKING HIS KEY TO ALL MYTHOLOGIES UNIMPEACHABLE WEIGHED LIKE LEAD UPONHIS MIND AND THE PAMPHLETSOR PARERGA AS HE CALLED THEMBY WHICH HETESTED HIS PUBLIC AND DEPOSITED SMALL MONUMENTAL RECORDS OF HIS MARCHWERE FAR FROM HAVING BEEN SEEN IN ALL THEIR SIGNIFICANCE
 HE SUSPECTEDTHE ARCHDEACON OF NOT HAVING READ THEM HE WAS IN PAINFUL DOUBT AS TOWHAT WAS REALLY THOUGHT OF THEM BY THE LEADING MINDS OF BRASENOSE ANDBITTERLY CONVINCED THAT HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCE CARP HAD BEEN THE WRITEROF THAT DEPRECIATORY RECENSION WHICH WAS KEPT LOCKED IN A SMALL DRAWEROF MR
 CASAUBONS DESK AND ALSO IN A DARK CLOSET OF HIS VERBAL MEMORY
THESE WERE HEAVY IMPRESSIONS TO STRUGGLE AGAINST AND BROUGHT THATMELANCHOLY EMBITTERMENT WHICH IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF ALL EXCESSIVECLAIM EVEN HIS RELIGIOUS FAITH WAVERED WITH HIS WAVERING TRUST IN HISOWN AUTHORSHIP AND THE CONSOLATIONS OF THE CHRISTIAN HOPE INIMMORTALITY SEEMED TO LEAN ON THE IMMORTALITY OF THE STILL UNWRITTENKEY TO ALL MYTHOLOGIES
 FOR MY PART I AM VERY SORRY FOR HIM
 IT IS ANUNEASY LOT AT BEST TO BE WHAT WE CALL HIGHLY TAUGHT AND YET NOT TOENJOY TO BE PRESENT AT THIS GREAT SPECTACLE OF LIFE AND NEVER TO BELIBERATED FROM A SMALL HUNGRY SHIVERING SELFNEVER TO BE FULLYPOSSESSED BY THE GLORY WE BEHOLD NEVER TO HAVE OUR CONSCIOUSNESSRAPTUROUSLY TRANSFORMED INTO THE VIVIDNESS OF A THOUGHT THE ARDOR OF APASSION THE ENERGY OF AN ACTION BUT ALWAYS TO BE SCHOLARLY ANDUNINSPIRED AMBITIOUS AND TIMID SCRUPULOUS AND DIMSIGHTED
 BECOMING ADEAN OR EVEN A BISHOP WOULD MAKE LITTLE DIFFERENCE I FEAR TO MR
CASAUBONS UNEASINESS
 DOUBTLESS SOME ANCIENT GREEK HAS OBSERVED THATBEHIND THE BIG MASK AND THE SPEAKINGTRUMPET THERE MUST ALWAYS BE OURPOOR LITTLE EYES PEEPING AS USUAL AND OUR TIMOROUS LIPS MORE OR LESSUNDER ANXIOUS CONTROL
TO THIS MENTAL ESTATE MAPPED OUT A QUARTER OF A CENTURY BEFORE TOSENSIBILITIES THUS FENCED IN MR
 CASAUBON HAD THOUGHT OF ANNEXINGHAPPINESS WITH A LOVELY YOUNG BRIDE BUT EVEN BEFORE MARRIAGE AS WEHAVE SEEN HE FOUND HIMSELF UNDER A NEW DEPRESSION IN THE CONSCIOUSNESSTHAT THE NEW BLISS WAS NOT BLISSFUL TO HIM
 INCLINATION YEARNED BACK TOITS OLD EASIER CUSTOM
 AND THE DEEPER HE WENT IN DOMESTICITY THE MOREDID THE SENSE OF ACQUITTING HIMSELF AND ACTING WITH PROPRIETYPREDOMINATE OVER ANY OTHER SATISFACTION
 MARRIAGE LIKE RELIGION ANDERUDITION NAY LIKE AUTHORSHIP ITSELF WAS FATED TO BECOME AN OUTWARDREQUIREMENT AND EDWARD CASAUBON WAS BENT ON FULFILLING UNIMPEACHABLYALL REQUIREMENTS
 EVEN DRAWING DOROTHEA INTO USE IN HIS STUDYACCORDING TO HIS OWN INTENTION BEFORE MARRIAGE WAS AN EFFORT WHICH HEWAS ALWAYS TEMPTED TO DEFER AND BUT FOR HER PLEADING INSISTENCE ITMIGHT NEVER HAVE BEGUN
 BUT SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN MAKING IT A MATTER OFCOURSE THAT SHE SHOULD TAKE HER PLACE AT AN EARLY HOUR IN THE LIBRARYAND HAVE WORK EITHER OF READING ALOUD OR COPYING ASSIGNED HER
 THE WORKHAD BEEN EASIER TO DEFINE BECAUSE MR
 CASAUBON HAD ADOPTED AN IMMEDIATEINTENTION THERE WAS TO BE A NEW PARERGON A SMALL MONOGRAPH ON SOMELATELY TRACED INDICATIONS CONCERNING THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERIES WHEREBYCERTAIN ASSERTIONS OF WARBURTONS COULD BE CORRECTED
 REFERENCES WEREEXTENSIVE EVEN HERE BUT NOT ALTOGETHER SHORELESS AND SENTENCES WEREACTUALLY TO BE WRITTEN IN THE SHAPE WHEREIN THEY WOULD BE SCANNED BYBRASENOSE AND A LESS FORMIDABLE POSTERITY
 THESE MINOR MONUMENTALPRODUCTIONS WERE ALWAYS EXCITING TO MR
 CASAUBON DIGESTION WAS MADEDIFFICULT BY THE INTERFERENCE OF CITATIONS OR BY THE RIVALRY OFDIALECTICAL PHRASES RINGING AGAINST EACH OTHER IN HIS BRAIN
 AND FROMTHE FIRST THERE WAS TO BE A LATIN DEDICATION ABOUT WHICH EVERYTHING WASUNCERTAIN EXCEPT THAT IT WAS NOT TO BE ADDRESSED TO CARP IT WAS APOISONOUS REGRET TO MR
 CASAUBON THAT HE HAD ONCE ADDRESSED ADEDICATION TO CARP IN WHICH HE HAD NUMBERED THAT MEMBER OF THE ANIMALKINGDOM AMONG THE VIROS NULLO ÆVO PERITUROS A MISTAKE WHICH WOULDINFALLIBLY LAY THE DEDICATOR OPEN TO RIDICULE IN THE NEXT AGE ANDMIGHT EVEN BE CHUCKLED OVER BY PIKE AND TENCH IN THE PRESENT
THUS MR
 CASAUBON WAS IN ONE OF HIS BUSIEST EPOCHS AND AS I BEGAN TOSAY A LITTLE WHILE AGO DOROTHEA JOINED HIM EARLY IN THE LIBRARY WHEREHE HAD BREAKFASTED ALONE
 CELIA AT THIS TIME WAS ON A SECOND VISIT TOLOWICK PROBABLY THE LAST BEFORE HER MARRIAGE AND WAS IN THEDRAWINGROOM EXPECTING SIR JAMES
DOROTHEA HAD LEARNED TO READ THE SIGNS OF HER HUSBANDS MOOD AND SHESAW THAT THE MORNING HAD BECOME MORE FOGGY THERE DURING THE LAST HOUR
SHE WAS GOING SILENTLY TO HER DESK WHEN HE SAID IN THAT DISTANT TONEWHICH IMPLIED THAT HE WAS DISCHARGING A DISAGREEABLE DUTYDOROTHEA HERE IS A LETTER FOR YOU WHICH WAS ENCLOSED IN ONEADDRESSED TO ME
IT WAS A LETTER OF TWO PAGES AND SHE IMMEDIATELY LOOKED AT THESIGNATURE
MR
 LADISLAW
 WHAT CAN HE HAVE TO SAY TO ME
 SHE EXCLAIMED IN A TONEOF PLEASED SURPRISE
 BUT SHE ADDED LOOKING AT MR
 CASAUBON I CANIMAGINE WHAT HE HAS WRITTEN TO YOU ABOUT
YOU CAN IF YOU PLEASE READ THE LETTER SAID MR
 CASAUBON SEVERELYPOINTING TO IT WITH HIS PEN AND NOT LOOKING AT HER
 BUT I MAY AS WELLSAY BEFOREHAND THAT I MUST DECLINE THE PROPOSAL IT CONTAINS TO PAY AVISIT HERE
 I TRUST I MAY BE EXCUSED FOR DESIRING AN INTERVAL OFCOMPLETE FREEDOM FROM SUCH DISTRACTIONS AS HAVE BEEN HITHERTOINEVITABLE AND ESPECIALLY FROM GUESTS WHOSE DESULTORY VIVACITY MAKESTHEIR PRESENCE A FATIGUE
THERE HAD BEEN NO CLASHING OF TEMPER BETWEEN DOROTHEA AND HER HUSBANDSINCE THAT LITTLE EXPLOSION IN ROME WHICH HAD LEFT SUCH STRONG TRACESIN HER MIND THAT IT HAD BEEN EASIER EVER SINCE TO QUELL EMOTION THAN TOINCUR THE CONSEQUENCE OF VENTING IT
 BUT THIS ILLTEMPERED ANTICIPATIONTHAT SHE COULD DESIRE VISITS WHICH MIGHT BE DISAGREEABLE TO HERHUSBAND THIS GRATUITOUS DEFENCE OF HIMSELF AGAINST SELFISH COMPLAINTON HER PART WAS TOO SHARP A STING TO BE MEDITATED ON UNTIL AFTER ITHAD BEEN RESENTED
 DOROTHEA HAD THOUGHT THAT SHE COULD HAVE BEENPATIENT WITH JOHN MILTON BUT SHE HAD NEVER IMAGINED HIM BEHAVING INTHIS WAY AND FOR A MOMENT MR
 CASAUBON SEEMED TO BE STUPIDLYUNDISCERNING AND ODIOUSLY UNJUST
 PITY THAT NEWBORN BABE WHICH WASBYANDBY TO RULE MANY A STORM WITHIN HER DID NOT STRIDE THE BLASTON THIS OCCASION
 WITH HER FIRST WORDS UTTERED IN A TONE THAT SHOOKHIM SHE STARTLED MR
 CASAUBON INTO LOOKING AT HER AND MEETING THEFLASH OF HER EYES
WHY DO YOU ATTRIBUTE TO ME A WISH FOR ANYTHING THAT WOULD ANNOY YOU
YOU SPEAK TO ME AS IF I WERE SOMETHING YOU HAD TO CONTEND AGAINST
 WAITAT LEAST TILL I APPEAR TO CONSULT MY OWN PLEASURE APART FROM YOURS
DOROTHEA YOU ARE HASTY ANSWERED MR
 CASAUBON NERVOUSLY
DECIDEDLY THIS WOMAN WAS TOO YOUNG TO BE ON THE FORMIDABLE LEVEL OFWIFEHOODUNLESS SHE HAD BEEN PALE AND FEATURELESS AND TAKEN EVERYTHINGFOR GRANTED
I THINK IT WAS YOU WHO WERE FIRST HASTY IN YOUR FALSE SUPPOSITIONSABOUT MY FEELING SAID DOROTHEA IN THE SAME TONE
 THE FIRE WAS NOTDISSIPATED YET AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS IGNOBLE IN HER HUSBAND NOT TOAPOLOGIZE TO HER
WE WILL IF YOU PLEASE SAY NO MORE ON THIS SUBJECT DOROTHEA
 I HAVENEITHER LEISURE NOR ENERGY FOR THIS KIND OF DEBATE
HERE MR
 CASAUBON DIPPED HIS PEN AND MADE AS IF HE WOULD RETURN TO HISWRITING THOUGH HIS HAND TREMBLED SO MUCH THAT THE WORDS SEEMED TO BEWRITTEN IN AN UNKNOWN CHARACTER
 THERE ARE ANSWERS WHICH IN TURNINGAWAY WRATH ONLY SEND IT TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM AND TO HAVE ADISCUSSION COOLLY WAIVED WHEN YOU FEEL THAT JUSTICE IS ALL ON YOUR OWNSIDE IS EVEN MORE EXASPERATING IN MARRIAGE THAN IN PHILOSOPHY
DOROTHEA LEFT LADISLAWS TWO LETTERS UNREAD ON HER HUSBANDSWRITINGTABLE AND WENT TO HER OWN PLACE THE SCORN AND INDIGNATIONWITHIN HER REJECTING THE READING OF THESE LETTERS JUST AS WE HURL AWAYANY TRASH TOWARDS WHICH WE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SUSPECTED OF MEANCUPIDITY
 SHE DID NOT IN THE LEAST DIVINE THE SUBTLE SOURCES OF HERHUSBANDS BAD TEMPER ABOUT THESE LETTERS SHE ONLY KNEW THAT THEY HADCAUSED HIM TO OFFEND HER
 SHE BEGAN TO WORK AT ONCE AND HER HAND DIDNOT TREMBLE ON THE CONTRARY IN WRITING OUT THE QUOTATIONS WHICH HADBEEN GIVEN TO HER THE DAY BEFORE SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS FORMING HERLETTERS BEAUTIFULLY AND IT SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE SAW THE CONSTRUCTIONOF THE LATIN SHE WAS COPYING AND WHICH SHE WAS BEGINNING TOUNDERSTAND MORE CLEARLY THAN USUAL
 IN HER INDIGNATION THERE WAS ASENSE OF SUPERIORITY BUT IT WENT OUT FOR THE PRESENT IN FIRMNESS OFSTROKE AND DID NOT COMPRESS ITSELF INTO AN INWARD ARTICULATE VOICEPRONOUNCING THE ONCE AFFABLE ARCHANGEL A POOR CREATURE
THERE HAD BEEN THIS APPARENT QUIET FOR HALF AN HOUR AND DOROTHEA HADNOT LOOKED AWAY FROM HER OWN TABLE WHEN SHE HEARD THE LOUD BANG OF ABOOK ON THE FLOOR AND TURNING QUICKLY SAW MR
 CASAUBON ON THE LIBRARYSTEPS CLINGING FORWARD AS IF HE WERE IN SOME BODILY DISTRESS
 SHESTARTED UP AND BOUNDED TOWARDS HIM IN AN INSTANT HE WAS EVIDENTLY INGREAT STRAITS FOR BREATH
 JUMPING ON A STOOL SHE GOT CLOSE TO HIS ELBOWAND SAID WITH HER WHOLE SOUL MELTED INTO TENDER ALARMCAN YOU LEAN ON ME DEAR
HE WAS STILL FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES WHICH SEEMED ENDLESS TO HERUNABLE TO SPEAK OR MOVE GASPING FOR BREATH
 WHEN AT LAST HE DESCENDEDTHE THREE STEPS AND FELL BACKWARD IN THE LARGE CHAIR WHICH DOROTHEA HADDRAWN CLOSE TO THE FOOT OF THE LADDER HE NO LONGER GASPED BUT SEEMEDHELPLESS AND ABOUT TO FAINT
 DOROTHEA RANG THE BELL VIOLENTLY ANDPRESENTLY MR
 CASAUBON WAS HELPED TO THE COUCH HE DID NOT FAINT ANDWAS GRADUALLY REVIVING WHEN SIR JAMES CHETTAM CAME IN HAVING BEEN METIN THE HALL WITH THE NEWS THAT MR
 CASAUBON HAD HAD A FIT IN THELIBRARY
GOOD GOD
 THIS IS JUST WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED WAS HISIMMEDIATE THOUGHT
 IF HIS PROPHETIC SOUL HAD BEEN URGED TOPARTICULARIZE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT FITS WOULD HAVE BEEN THEDEFINITE EXPRESSION ALIGHTED UPON
 HE ASKED HIS INFORMANT THE BUTLERWHETHER THE DOCTOR HAD BEEN SENT FOR
 THE BUTLER NEVER KNEW HIS MASTERTO WANT THE DOCTOR BEFORE BUT WOULD IT NOT BE RIGHT TO SEND FOR APHYSICIAN
WHEN SIR JAMES ENTERED THE LIBRARY HOWEVER MR
 CASAUBON COULD MAKESOME SIGNS OF HIS USUAL POLITENESS AND DOROTHEA WHO IN THE REACTIONFROM HER FIRST TERROR HAD BEEN KNEELING AND SOBBING BY HIS SIDE NOWROSE AND HERSELF PROPOSED THAT SOME ONE SHOULD RIDE OFF FOR A MEDICALMAN
I RECOMMEND YOU TO SEND FOR LYDGATE SAID SIR JAMES
 MY MOTHER HASCALLED HIM IN AND SHE HAS FOUND HIM UNCOMMONLY CLEVER
 SHE HAS HAD APOOR OPINION OF THE PHYSICIANS SINCE MY FATHERS DEATH
DOROTHEA APPEALED TO HER HUSBAND AND HE MADE A SILENT SIGN OFAPPROVAL
 SO MR
 LYDGATE WAS SENT FOR AND HE CAME WONDERFULLY SOON FORTHE MESSENGER WHO WAS SIR JAMES CHETTAMS MAN AND KNEW MR
 LYDGATEMET HIM LEADING HIS HORSE ALONG THE LOWICK ROAD AND GIVING HIS ARM TOMISS VINCY
CELIA IN THE DRAWINGROOM HAD KNOWN NOTHING OF THE TROUBLE TILL SIRJAMES TOLD HER OF IT
 AFTER DOROTHEAS ACCOUNT HE NO LONGER CONSIDEREDTHE ILLNESS A FIT BUT STILL SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE
POOR DEAR DODOHOW DREADFUL
 SAID CELIA FEELING AS MUCH GRIEVED ASHER OWN PERFECT HAPPINESS WOULD ALLOW
 HER LITTLE HANDS WERE CLASPEDAND ENCLOSED BY SIR JAMESS AS A BUD IS ENFOLDED BY A LIBERAL CALYX
IT IS VERY SHOCKING THAT MR
 CASAUBON SHOULD BE ILL BUT I NEVER DIDLIKE HIM
 AND I THINK HE IS NOT HALF FOND ENOUGH OF DOROTHEA AND HEOUGHT TO BE FOR I AM SURE NO ONE ELSE WOULD HAVE HAD HIMDO YOU THINKTHEY WOULD
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT A HORRIBLE SACRIFICE OF YOUR SISTER SAID SIRJAMES
YES
 BUT POOR DODO NEVER DID DO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DO AND I THINK SHENEVER WILL
SHE IS A NOBLE CREATURE SAID THE LOYALHEARTED SIR JAMES
 HE HADJUST HAD A FRESH IMPRESSION OF THIS KIND AS HE HAD SEEN DOROTHEASTRETCHING HER TENDER ARM UNDER HER HUSBANDS NECK AND LOOKING AT HIMWITH UNSPEAKABLE SORROW
 HE DID NOT KNOW HOW MUCH PENITENCE THERE WASIN THE SORROW
YES SAID CELIA THINKING IT WAS VERY WELL FOR SIR JAMES TO SAY SOBUT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN COMFORTABLE WITH DODO
 SHALL I GO TO HER
COULD I HELP HER DO YOU THINK
I THINK IT WOULD BE WELL FOR YOU JUST TO GO AND SEE HER BEFORE LYDGATECOMES SAID SIR JAMES MAGNANIMOUSLY
 ONLY DONT STAY LONG
WHILE CELIA WAS GONE HE WALKED UP AND DOWN REMEMBERING WHAT HE HADORIGINALLY FELT ABOUT DOROTHEAS ENGAGEMENT AND FEELING A REVIVAL OFHIS DISGUST AT MR
 BROOKES INDIFFERENCE
 IF CADWALLADERIF EVERY ONEELSE HAD REGARDED THE AFFAIR AS HE SIR JAMES HAD DONE THE MARRIAGEMIGHT HAVE BEEN HINDERED
 IT WAS WICKED TO LET A YOUNG GIRL BLINDLYDECIDE HER FATE IN THAT WAY WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SAVE HER
 SIR JAMESHAD LONG CEASED TO HAVE ANY REGRETS ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT HIS HEART WASSATISFIED WITH HIS ENGAGEMENT TO CELIA
 BUT HE HAD A CHIVALROUS NATUREWAS NOT THE DISINTERESTED SERVICE OF WOMAN AMONG THE IDEAL GLORIES OFOLD CHIVALRY
 HIS DISREGARDED LOVE HAD NOT TURNED TO BITTERNESS ITSDEATH HAD MADE SWEET ODORSFLOATING MEMORIES THAT CLUNG WITH ACONSECRATING EFFECT TO DOROTHEA
 HE COULD REMAIN HER BROTHERLY FRIENDINTERPRETING HER ACTIONS WITH GENEROUS TRUSTFULNESS
CHAPTER XXX
QUI VEUT DÉLASSER HORS DE PROPOS LASSE
PASCAL
MR
 CASAUBON HAD NO SECOND ATTACK OF EQUAL SEVERITY WITH THE FIRST ANDIN A FEW DAYS BEGAN TO RECOVER HIS USUAL CONDITION
 BUT LYDGATE SEEMEDTO THINK THE CASE WORTH A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION
 HE NOT ONLY USED HISSTETHOSCOPE WHICH HAD NOT BECOME A MATTER OF COURSE IN PRACTICE ATTHAT TIME BUT SAT QUIETLY BY HIS PATIENT AND WATCHED HIM
 TO MR
CASAUBONS QUESTIONS ABOUT HIMSELF HE REPLIED THAT THE SOURCE OF THEILLNESS WAS THE COMMON ERROR OF INTELLECTUAL MENA TOO EAGER ANDMONOTONOUS APPLICATION THE REMEDY WAS TO BE SATISFIED WITH MODERATEWORK AND TO SEEK VARIETY OF RELAXATION
 MR
 BROOKE WHO SAT BY ON ONEOCCASION SUGGESTED THAT MR
 CASAUBON SHOULD GO FISHING AS CADWALLADERDID AND HAVE A TURNINGROOM MAKE TOYS TABLELEGS AND THAT KIND OFTHING
IN SHORT YOU RECOMMEND ME TO ANTICIPATE THE ARRIVAL OF MY SECONDCHILDHOOD SAID POOR MR
 CASAUBON WITH SOME BITTERNESS
 THESETHINGS HE ADDED LOOKING AT LYDGATE WOULD BE TO ME SUCH RELAXATIONAS TOWPICKING IS TO PRISONERS IN A HOUSE OF CORRECTION
I CONFESS SAID LYDGATE SMILING AMUSEMENT IS RATHER ANUNSATISFACTORY PRESCRIPTION
 IT IS SOMETHING LIKE TELLING PEOPLE TOKEEP UP THEIR SPIRITS
 PERHAPS I HAD BETTER SAY THAT YOU MUST SUBMITTO BE MILDLY BORED RATHER THAN TO GO ON WORKING
YES YES SAID MR
 BROOKE
 GET DOROTHEA TO PLAY BACKGAMMON WITH YOUIN THE EVENINGS
 AND SHUTTLECOCK NOWI DONT KNOW A FINER GAME THANSHUTTLECOCK FOR THE DAYTIME
 I REMEMBER IT ALL THE FASHION
 TO BE SUREYOUR EYES MIGHT NOT STAND THAT CASAUBON
 BUT YOU MUST UNBEND YOUKNOW
 WHY YOU MIGHT TAKE TO SOME LIGHT STUDY CONCHOLOGY NOW IALWAYS THINK THAT MUST BE A LIGHT STUDY
 OR GET DOROTHEA TO READ YOULIGHT THINGS SMOLLETTRODERICK RANDOM HUMPHREY CLINKER THEY AREA LITTLE BROAD BUT SHE MAY READ ANYTHING NOW SHES MARRIED YOU KNOW
I REMEMBER THEY MADE ME LAUGH UNCOMMONLYTHERES A DROLL BIT ABOUT APOSTILIONS BREECHES
 WE HAVE NO SUCH HUMOR NOW
 I HAVE GONE THROUGHALL THESE THINGS BUT THEY MIGHT BE RATHER NEW TO YOU
AS NEW AS EATING THISTLES WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ANSWER TO REPRESENT MR
CASAUBONS FEELINGS
 BUT HE ONLY BOWED RESIGNEDLY WITH DUE RESPECT TOHIS WIFES UNCLE AND OBSERVED THAT DOUBTLESS THE WORKS HE MENTIONEDHAD SERVED AS A RESOURCE TO A CERTAIN ORDER OF MINDS
YOU SEE SAID THE ABLE MAGISTRATE TO LYDGATE WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDETHE DOOR CASAUBON HAS BEEN A LITTLE NARROW IT LEAVES HIM RATHER AT ALOSS WHEN YOU FORBID HIM HIS PARTICULAR WORK WHICH I BELIEVE ISSOMETHING VERY DEEP INDEEDIN THE LINE OF RESEARCH YOU KNOW
 I WOULDNEVER GIVE WAY TO THAT I WAS ALWAYS VERSATILE
 BUT A CLERGYMAN IS TIEDA LITTLE TIGHT
 IF THEY WOULD MAKE HIM A BISHOP NOW
HE DID A VERYGOOD PAMPHLET FOR PEEL
 HE WOULD HAVE MORE MOVEMENT THEN MORE SHOW HEMIGHT GET A LITTLE FLESH
 BUT I RECOMMEND YOU TO TALK TO MRS
 CASAUBON
SHE IS CLEVER ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING IS MY NIECE
 TELL HER HER HUSBANDWANTS LIVELINESS DIVERSION PUT HER ON AMUSING TACTICS
WITHOUT MR
 BROOKES ADVICE LYDGATE HAD DETERMINED ON SPEAKING TODOROTHEA
 SHE HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT WHILE HER UNCLE WAS THROWING OUT HISPLEASANT SUGGESTIONS AS TO THE MODE IN WHICH LIFE AT LOWICK MIGHT BEENLIVENED BUT SHE WAS USUALLY BY HER HUSBANDS SIDE AND THEUNAFFECTED SIGNS OF INTENSE ANXIETY IN HER FACE AND VOICE ABOUTWHATEVER TOUCHED HIS MIND OR HEALTH MADE A DRAMA WHICH LYDGATE WASINCLINED TO WATCH
 HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS ONLY DOING RIGHT INTELLING HER THE TRUTH ABOUT HER HUSBANDS PROBABLE FUTURE BUT HECERTAINLY THOUGHT ALSO THAT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO TALKCONFIDENTIALLY WITH HER
 A MEDICAL MAN LIKES TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGICALOBSERVATIONS AND SOMETIMES IN THE PURSUIT OF SUCH STUDIES IS TOOEASILY TEMPTED INTO MOMENTOUS PROPHECY WHICH LIFE AND DEATH EASILY SETAT NOUGHT
 LYDGATE HAD OFTEN BEEN SATIRICAL ON THIS GRATUITOUSPREDICTION AND HE MEANT NOW TO BE GUARDED
HE ASKED FOR MRS
 CASAUBON BUT BEING TOLD THAT SHE WAS OUT WALKING HEWAS GOING AWAY WHEN DOROTHEA AND CELIA APPEARED BOTH GLOWING FROMTHEIR STRUGGLE WITH THE MARCH WIND
 WHEN LYDGATE BEGGED TO SPEAK WITHHER ALONE DOROTHEA OPENED THE LIBRARY DOOR WHICH HAPPENED TO BE THENEAREST THINKING OF NOTHING AT THE MOMENT BUT WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TOSAY ABOUT MR
 CASAUBON
 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD ENTERED THIS ROOMSINCE HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN TAKEN ILL AND THE SERVANT HAD CHOSEN NOT TOOPEN THE SHUTTERS
 BUT THERE WAS LIGHT ENOUGH TO READ BY FROM THENARROW UPPER PANES OF THE WINDOWS
YOU WILL NOT MIND THIS SOMBRE LIGHT SAID DOROTHEA STANDING IN THEMIDDLE OF THE ROOM
 SINCE YOU FORBADE BOOKS THE LIBRARY HAS BEEN OUTOF THE QUESTION
 BUT MR
 CASAUBON WILL SOON BE HERE AGAIN I HOPE
 ISHE NOT MAKING PROGRESS
YES MUCH MORE RAPID PROGRESS THAN I AT FIRST EXPECTED
 INDEED HE ISALREADY NEARLY IN HIS USUAL STATE OF HEALTH
YOU DO NOT FEAR THAT THE ILLNESS WILL RETURN
 SAID DOROTHEA WHOSEQUICK EAR HAD DETECTED SOME SIGNIFICANCE IN LYDGATES TONE
SUCH CASES ARE PECULIARLY DIFFICULT TO PRONOUNCE UPON SAID LYDGATE
THE ONLY POINT ON WHICH I CAN BE CONFIDENT IS THAT IT WILL BEDESIRABLE TO BE VERY WATCHFUL ON MR
 CASAUBONS ACCOUNT LEST HE SHOULDIN ANY WAY STRAIN HIS NERVOUS POWER
I BESEECH YOU TO SPEAK QUITE PLAINLY SAID DOROTHEA IN AN IMPLORINGTONE
 I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING WHICH I DIDNOT KNOW AND WHICH IF I HAD KNOWN IT WOULD HAVE MADE ME ACTDIFFERENTLY
 THE WORDS CAME OUT LIKE A CRY IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEYWERE THE VOICE OF SOME MENTAL EXPERIENCE WHICH LAY NOT VERY FAR OFF
SIT DOWN SHE ADDED PLACING HERSELF ON THE NEAREST CHAIR ANDTHROWING OFF HER BONNET AND GLOVES WITH AN INSTINCTIVE DISCARDING OFFORMALITY WHERE A GREAT QUESTION OF DESTINY WAS CONCERNED
WHAT YOU SAY NOW JUSTIFIES MY OWN VIEW SAID LYDGATE
 I THINK IT ISONES FUNCTION AS A MEDICAL MAN TO HINDER REGRETS OF THAT SORT AS FARAS POSSIBLE
 BUT I BEG YOU TO OBSERVE THAT MR
 CASAUBONS CASE ISPRECISELY OF THE KIND IN WHICH THE ISSUE IS MOST DIFFICULT TO PRONOUNCEUPON
 HE MAY POSSIBLY LIVE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS OR MORE WITHOUT MUCHWORSE HEALTH THAN HE HAS HAD HITHERTO
DOROTHEA HAD TURNED VERY PALE AND WHEN LYDGATE PAUSED SHE SAID IN ALOW VOICE YOU MEAN IF WE ARE VERY CAREFUL
YESCAREFUL AGAINST MENTAL AGITATION OF ALL KINDS AND AGAINSTEXCESSIVE APPLICATION
HE WOULD BE MISERABLE IF HE HAD TO GIVE UP HIS WORK SAID DOROTHEAWITH A QUICK PREVISION OF THAT WRETCHEDNESS
I AM AWARE OF THAT
 THE ONLY COURSE IS TO TRY BY ALL MEANS DIRECT ANDINDIRECT TO MODERATE AND VARY HIS OCCUPATIONS
 WITH A HAPPYCONCURRENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES THERE IS AS I SAID NO IMMEDIATE DANGERFROM THAT AFFECTION OF THE HEART WHICH I BELIEVE TO HAVE BEEN THECAUSE OF HIS LATE ATTACK
 ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEDISEASE MAY DEVELOP ITSELF MORE RAPIDLY IT IS ONE OF THOSE CASES INWHICH DEATH IS SOMETIMES SUDDEN
 NOTHING SHOULD BE NEGLECTED WHICHMIGHT BE AFFECTED BY SUCH AN ISSUE
THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A FEW MOMENTS WHILE DOROTHEA SAT AS IF SHE HADBEEN TURNED TO MARBLE THOUGH THE LIFE WITHIN HER WAS SO INTENSE THATHER MIND HAD NEVER BEFORE SWEPT IN BRIEF TIME OVER AN EQUAL RANGE OFSCENES AND MOTIVES
HELP ME PRAY SHE SAID AT LAST IN THE SAME LOW VOICE AS BEFORE
TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF FOREIGN TRAVEL
 YOU HAVE BEEN LATELY IN ROME ITHINK
THE MEMORIES WHICH MADE THIS RESOURCE UTTERLY HOPELESS WERE A NEWCURRENT THAT SHOOK DOROTHEA OUT OF HER PALLID IMMOBILITY
OH THAT WOULD NOT DOTHAT WOULD BE WORSE THAN ANYTHING SHE SAIDWITH A MORE CHILDLIKE DESPONDENCY WHILE THE TEARS ROLLED DOWN
NOTHING WILL BE OF ANY USE THAT HE DOES NOT ENJOY
I WISH THAT I COULD HAVE SPARED YOU THIS PAIN SAID LYDGATE DEEPLYTOUCHED YET WONDERING ABOUT HER MARRIAGE
 WOMEN JUST LIKE DOROTHEA HADNOT ENTERED INTO HIS TRADITIONS
IT WAS RIGHT OF YOU TO TELL ME
 I THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME THE TRUTH
I WISH YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT I SHALL NOT SAY ANYTHING TO ENLIGHTENMR
 CASAUBON HIMSELF
 I THINK IT DESIRABLE FOR HIM TO KNOW NOTHING MORETHAN THAT HE MUST NOT OVERWORK HIMSELF AND MUST OBSERVE CERTAIN RULES
ANXIETY OF ANY KIND WOULD BE PRECISELY THE MOST UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONFOR HIM
LYDGATE ROSE AND DOROTHEA MECHANICALLY ROSE AT THE SAME TIMEUNCLASPING HER CLOAK AND THROWING IT OFF AS IF IT STIFLED HER
 HE WASBOWING AND QUITTING HER WHEN AN IMPULSE WHICH IF SHE HAD BEEN ALONEWOULD HAVE TURNED INTO A PRAYER MADE HER SAY WITH A SOB IN HER VOICEOH YOU ARE A WISE MAN ARE YOU NOT
 YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT LIFE ANDDEATH
 ADVISE ME
 THINK WHAT I CAN DO
 HE HAS BEEN LABORING ALL HISLIFE AND LOOKING FORWARD
 HE MINDS ABOUT NOTHING ELSE
 AND I MINDABOUT NOTHING ELSEFOR YEARS AFTER LYDGATE REMEMBERED THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED IN HIM BYTHIS INVOLUNTARY APPEALTHIS CRY FROM SOUL TO SOUL WITHOUT OTHERCONSCIOUSNESS THAN THEIR MOVING WITH KINDRED NATURES IN THE SAMEEMBROILED MEDIUM THE SAME TROUBLOUS FITFULLY ILLUMINATED LIFE
 BUTWHAT COULD HE SAY NOW EXCEPT THAT HE SHOULD SEE MR
 CASAUBON AGAINTOMORROW
WHEN HE WAS GONE DOROTHEAS TEARS GUSHED FORTH AND RELIEVED HERSTIFLING OPPRESSION
 THEN SHE DRIED HER EYES REMINDED THAT HERDISTRESS MUST NOT BE BETRAYED TO HER HUSBAND AND LOOKED ROUND THE ROOMTHINKING THAT SHE MUST ORDER THE SERVANT TO ATTEND TO IT AS USUALSINCE MR
 CASAUBON MIGHT NOW AT ANY MOMENT WISH TO ENTER
 ON HISWRITINGTABLE THERE WERE LETTERS WHICH HAD LAIN UNTOUCHED SINCE THEMORNING WHEN HE WAS TAKEN ILL AND AMONG THEM AS DOROTHEA WELLREMEMBERED THERE WERE YOUNG LADISLAWS LETTERS THE ONE ADDRESSED TOHER STILL UNOPENED
 THE ASSOCIATIONS OF THESE LETTERS HAD BEEN MADE THEMORE PAINFUL BY THAT SUDDEN ATTACK OF ILLNESS WHICH SHE FELT THAT THEAGITATION CAUSED BY HER ANGER MIGHT HAVE HELPED TO BRING ON IT WOULDBE TIME ENOUGH TO READ THEM WHEN THEY WERE AGAIN THRUST UPON HER ANDSHE HAD HAD NO INCLINATION TO FETCH THEM FROM THE LIBRARY
 BUT NOW ITOCCURRED TO HER THAT THEY SHOULD BE PUT OUT OF HER HUSBANDS SIGHTWHATEVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE SOURCES OF HIS ANNOYANCE ABOUT THEM HEMUST IF POSSIBLE NOT BE ANNOYED AGAIN AND SHE RAN HER EYES FIRSTOVER THE LETTER ADDRESSED TO HIM TO ASSURE HERSELF WHETHER OR NOT ITWOULD BE NECESSARY TO WRITE IN ORDER TO HINDER THE OFFENSIVE VISIT
WILL WROTE FROM ROME AND BEGAN BY SAYING THAT HIS OBLIGATIONS TO MR
CASAUBON WERE TOO DEEP FOR ALL THANKS NOT TO SEEM IMPERTINENT
 IT WASPLAIN THAT IF HE WERE NOT GRATEFUL HE MUST BE THE POORESTSPIRITEDRASCAL WHO HAD EVER FOUND A GENEROUS FRIEND
 TO EXPAND IN WORDY THANKSWOULD BE LIKE SAYING I AM HONEST
 BUT WILL HAD COME TO PERCEIVE THATHIS DEFECTSDEFECTS WHICH MR
 CASAUBON HAD HIMSELF OFTEN POINTEDTONEEDED FOR THEIR CORRECTION THAT MORE STRENUOUS POSITION WHICH HISRELATIVES GENEROSITY HAD HITHERTO PREVENTED FROM BEING INEVITABLE
 HETRUSTED THAT HE SHOULD MAKE THE BEST RETURN IF RETURN WERE POSSIBLEBY SHOWING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EDUCATION FOR WHICH HE WASINDEBTED AND BY CEASING IN FUTURE TO NEED ANY DIVERSION TOWARDSHIMSELF OF FUNDS ON WHICH OTHERS MIGHT HAVE A BETTER CLAIM
 HE WASCOMING TO ENGLAND TO TRY HIS FORTUNE AS MANY OTHER YOUNG MEN WEREOBLIGED TO DO WHOSE ONLY CAPITAL WAS IN THEIR BRAINS
 HIS FRIENDNAUMANN HAD DESIRED HIM TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE DISPUTETHE PICTUREPAINTED FOR MR
 CASAUBON WITH WHOSE PERMISSION AND MRS
 CASAUBONSWILL WOULD CONVEY IT TO LOWICK IN PERSON
 A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THEPOSTE RESTANTE IN PARIS WITHIN THE FORTNIGHT WOULD HINDER HIM IFNECESSARY FROM ARRIVING AT AN INCONVENIENT MOMENT
 HE ENCLOSED ALETTER TO MRS
 CASAUBON IN WHICH HE CONTINUED A DISCUSSION ABOUT ARTBEGUN WITH HER IN ROME
OPENING HER OWN LETTER DOROTHEA SAW THAT IT WAS A LIVELY CONTINUATIONOF HIS REMONSTRANCE WITH HER FANATICAL SYMPATHY AND HER WANT OF STURDYNEUTRAL DELIGHT IN THINGS AS THEY WEREAN OUTPOURING OF HIS YOUNGVIVACITY WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO READ JUST NOW
 SHE HAD IMMEDIATELYTO CONSIDER WHAT WAS TO BE DONE ABOUT THE OTHER LETTER THERE WAS STILLTIME PERHAPS TO PREVENT WILL FROM COMING TO LOWICK
 DOROTHEA ENDED BYGIVING THE LETTER TO HER UNCLE WHO WAS STILL IN THE HOUSE AND BEGGINGHIM TO LET WILL KNOW THAT MR
 CASAUBON HAD BEEN ILL AND THAT HISHEALTH WOULD NOT ALLOW THE RECEPTION OF ANY VISITORS
NO ONE MORE READY THAN MR
 BROOKE TO WRITE A LETTER HIS ONLYDIFFICULTY WAS TO WRITE A SHORT ONE AND HIS IDEAS IN THIS CASEEXPANDED OVER THE THREE LARGE PAGES AND THE INWARD FOLDINGS
 HE HADSIMPLY SAID TO DOROTHEATO BE SURE I WILL WRITE MY DEAR
 HES A VERY CLEVER YOUNGFELLOWTHIS YOUNG LADISLAWI DARE SAY WILL BE A RISING YOUNG MAN
 ITSA GOOD LETTERMARKS HIS SENSE OF THINGS YOU KNOW
 HOWEVER I WILL TELLHIM ABOUT CASAUBON
BUT THE END OF MR
 BROOKES PEN WAS A THINKING ORGAN EVOLVINGSENTENCES ESPECIALLY OF A BENEVOLENT KIND BEFORE THE REST OF HIS MINDCOULD WELL OVERTAKE THEM
 IT EXPRESSED REGRETS AND PROPOSED REMEDIESWHICH WHEN MR
 BROOKE READ THEM SEEMED FELICITOUSLYWORDEDSURPRISINGLY THE RIGHT THING AND DETERMINED A SEQUEL WHICH HEHAD NEVER BEFORE THOUGHT OF
 IN THIS CASE HIS PEN FOUND IT SUCH A PITYYOUNG LADISLAW SHOULD NOT HAVE COME INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD JUST AT THATTIME IN ORDER THAT MR
 BROOKE MIGHT MAKE HIS ACQUAINTANCE MORE FULLYAND THAT THEY MIGHT GO OVER THE LONGNEGLECTED ITALIAN DRAWINGSTOGETHERIT ALSO FELT SUCH AN INTEREST IN A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS STARTINGIN LIFE WITH A STOCK OF IDEASTHAT BY THE END OF THE SECOND PAGE IT HADPERSUADED MR
 BROOKE TO INVITE YOUNG LADISLAW SINCE HE COULD NOT BERECEIVED AT LOWICK TO COME TO TIPTON GRANGE
 WHY NOT
 THEY COULD FINDA GREAT MANY THINGS TO DO TOGETHER AND THIS WAS A PERIOD OF PECULIARGROWTHTHE POLITICAL HORIZON WAS EXPANDING ANDIN SHORT MR
 BROOKESPEN WENT OFF INTO A LITTLE SPEECH WHICH IT HAD LATELY REPORTED FOR THATIMPERFECTLY EDITED ORGAN THE MIDDLEMARCH PIONEER
 WHILE MR
 BROOKEWAS SEALING THIS LETTER HE FELT ELATED WITH AN INFLUX OF DIMPROJECTSA YOUNG MAN CAPABLE OF PUTTING IDEAS INTO FORM THE PIONEERPURCHASED TO CLEAR THE PATHWAY FOR A NEW CANDIDATE DOCUMENTSUTILIZEDWHO KNEW WHAT MIGHT COME OF IT ALL
 SINCE CELIA WAS GOING TOMARRY IMMEDIATELY IT WOULD BE VERY PLEASANT TO HAVE A YOUNG FELLOW ATTABLE WITH HIM AT LEAST FOR A TIME
BUT HE WENT AWAY WITHOUT TELLING DOROTHEA WHAT HE HAD PUT INTO THELETTER FOR SHE WAS ENGAGED WITH HER HUSBAND ANDIN FACT THESE THINGSWERE OF NO IMPORTANCE TO HER
CHAPTER XXXI
HOW WILL YOU KNOW THE PITCH OF THAT GREAT BELLTOO LARGE FOR YOU TO STIR
 LET BUT A FLUTEPLAY NEATH THE FINEMIXED METAL LISTEN CLOSETILL THE RIGHT NOTE FLOWS FORTH A SILVERY RILLTHEN SHALL THE HUGE BELL TREMBLETHEN THE MASSWITH MYRIAD WAVES CONCURRENT SHALL RESPONDIN LOW SOFT UNISON
LYDGATE THAT EVENING SPOKE TO MISS VINCY OF MRS
 CASAUBON AND LAIDSOME EMPHASIS ON THE STRONG FEELING SHE APPEARED TO HAVE FOR THATFORMAL STUDIOUS MAN THIRTY YEARS OLDER THAN HERSELF
OF COURSE SHE IS DEVOTED TO HER HUSBAND SAID ROSAMOND IMPLYING ANOTION OF NECESSARY SEQUENCE WHICH THE SCIENTIFIC MAN REGARDED AS THEPRETTIEST POSSIBLE FOR A WOMAN BUT SHE WAS THINKING AT THE SAME TIMETHAT IT WAS NOT SO VERY MELANCHOLY TO BE MISTRESS OF LOWICK MANOR WITHA HUSBAND LIKELY TO DIE SOON
 DO YOU THINK HER VERY HANDSOME
SHE CERTAINLY IS HANDSOME BUT I HAVE NOT THOUGHT ABOUT IT SAIDLYDGATE
I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE UNPROFESSIONAL SAID ROSAMOND DIMPLING
 BUTHOW YOUR PRACTICE IS SPREADING
 YOU WERE CALLED IN BEFORE TO THECHETTAMS I THINK AND NOW THE CASAUBONS
YES SAID LYDGATE IN A TONE OF COMPULSORY ADMISSION
 BUT I DONTREALLY LIKE ATTENDING SUCH PEOPLE SO WELL AS THE POOR
 THE CASES AREMORE MONOTONOUS AND ONE HAS TO GO THROUGH MORE FUSS AND LISTEN MOREDEFERENTIALLY TO NONSENSE
NOT MORE THAN IN MIDDLEMARCH SAID ROSAMOND
 AND AT LEAST YOU GOTHROUGH WIDE CORRIDORS AND HAVE THE SCENT OF ROSELEAVES EVERYWHERE
THAT IS TRUE MADEMOISELLE DE MONTMORENCI SAID LYDGATE JUST BENDINGHIS HEAD TO THE TABLE AND LIFTING WITH HIS FOURTH FINGER HER DELICATEHANDKERCHIEF WHICH LAY AT THE MOUTH OF HER RETICULE AS IF TO ENJOY ITSSCENT WHILE HE LOOKED AT HER WITH A SMILE
BUT THIS AGREEABLE HOLIDAY FREEDOM WITH WHICH LYDGATE HOVERED ABOUT THEFLOWER OF MIDDLEMARCH COULD NOT CONTINUE INDEFINITELY
 IT WAS NOT MOREPOSSIBLE TO FIND SOCIAL ISOLATION IN THAT TOWN THAN ELSEWHERE AND TWOPEOPLE PERSISTENTLY FLIRTING COULD BY NO MEANS ESCAPE FROM THE VARIOUSENTANGLEMENTS WEIGHTS BLOWS CLASHINGS MOTIONS BY WHICH THINGSSEVERALLY GO ON
 WHATEVER MISS VINCY DID MUST BE REMARKED AND SHE WASPERHAPS THE MORE CONSPICUOUS TO ADMIRERS AND CRITICS BECAUSE JUST NOWMRS
 VINCY AFTER SOME STRUGGLE HAD GONE WITH FRED TO STAY A LITTLEWHILE AT STONE COURT THERE BEING NO OTHER WAY OF AT ONCE GRATIFYINGOLD FEATHERSTONE AND KEEPING WATCH AGAINST MARY GARTH WHO APPEARED ALESS TOLERABLE DAUGHTERINLAW IN PROPORTION AS FREDS ILLNESSDISAPPEARED
AUNT BULSTRODE FOR EXAMPLE CAME A LITTLE OFTENER INTO LOWICK GATE TOSEE ROSAMOND NOW SHE WAS ALONE
 FOR MRS
 BULSTRODE HAD A TRUE SISTERLYFEELING FOR HER BROTHER ALWAYS THINKING THAT HE MIGHT HAVE MARRIEDBETTER BUT WISHING WELL TO THE CHILDREN
 NOW MRS
 BULSTRODE HAD ALONGSTANDING INTIMACY WITH MRS
 PLYMDALE
 THEY HAD NEARLY THE SAMEPREFERENCES IN SILKS PATTERNS FOR UNDERCLOTHING CHINAWARE ANDCLERGYMEN THEY CONFIDED THEIR LITTLE TROUBLES OF HEALTH AND HOUSEHOLDMANAGEMENT TO EACH OTHER AND VARIOUS LITTLE POINTS OF SUPERIORITY ONMRS
 BULSTRODES SIDE NAMELY MORE DECIDED SERIOUSNESS MOREADMIRATION FOR MIND AND A HOUSE OUTSIDE THE TOWN SOMETIMES SERVED TOGIVE COLOR TO THEIR CONVERSATION WITHOUT DIVIDING THEMWELLMEANINGWOMEN BOTH KNOWING VERY LITTLE OF THEIR OWN MOTIVES
MRS
 BULSTRODE PAYING A MORNING VISIT TO MRS
 PLYMDALE HAPPENED TOSAY THAT SHE COULD NOT STAY LONGER BECAUSE SHE WAS GOING TO SEE POORROSAMOND
WHY DO YOU SAY POOR ROSAMOND
 SAID MRS
 PLYMDALE A ROUNDEYEDSHARP LITTLE WOMAN LIKE A TAMED FALCON
SHE IS SO PRETTY AND HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP IN SUCH THOUGHTLESSNESS
 THEMOTHER YOU KNOW HAD ALWAYS THAT LEVITY ABOUT HER WHICH MAKES MEANXIOUS FOR THE CHILDREN
WELL HARRIET IF I AM TO SPEAK MY MIND SAID MRS
 PLYMDALE WITHEMPHASIS I MUST SAY ANYBODY WOULD SUPPOSE YOU AND MR
 BULSTRODEWOULD BE DELIGHTED WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED FOR YOU HAVE DONE EVERYTHINGTO PUT MR
 LYDGATE FORWARD
SELINA WHAT DO YOU MEAN
 SAID MRS
 BULSTRODE IN GENUINE SURPRISE
NOT BUT WHAT I AM TRULY THANKFUL FOR NEDS SAKE SAID MRS
 PLYMDALE
HE COULD CERTAINLY BETTER AFFORD TO KEEP SUCH A WIFE THAN SOME PEOPLECAN BUT I SHOULD WISH HIM TO LOOK ELSEWHERE
 STILL A MOTHER HASANXIETIES AND SOME YOUNG MEN WOULD TAKE TO A BAD LIFE IN CONSEQUENCE
BESIDES IF I WAS OBLIGED TO SPEAK I SHOULD SAY I WAS NOT FOND OFSTRANGERS COMING INTO A TOWN
I DONT KNOW SELINA SAID MRS
 BULSTRODE WITH A LITTLE EMPHASIS INHER TURN
 MR
 BULSTRODE WAS A STRANGER HERE AT ONE TIME
 ABRAHAM ANDMOSES WERE STRANGERS IN THE LAND AND WE ARE TOLD TO ENTERTAINSTRANGERS
 AND ESPECIALLY SHE ADDED AFTER A SLIGHT PAUSE WHEN THEYARE UNEXCEPTIONABLE
I WAS NOT SPEAKING IN A RELIGIOUS SENSE HARRIET
 I SPOKE AS AMOTHER
SELINA I AM SURE YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD ME SAY ANYTHING AGAINST A NIECEOF MINE MARRYING YOUR SON
OH IT IS PRIDE IN MISS VINCYI AM SURE IT IS NOTHING ELSE SAID MRS
PLYMDALE WHO HAD NEVER BEFORE GIVEN ALL HER CONFIDENCE TO HARRIET ONTHIS SUBJECT
 NO YOUNG MAN IN MIDDLEMARCH WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER IHAVE HEARD HER MOTHER SAY AS MUCH
 THAT IS NOT A CHRISTIAN SPIRIT ITHINK
 BUT NOW FROM ALL I HEAR SHE HAS FOUND A MAN AS PROUD ASHERSELF
YOU DONT MEAN THAT THERE IS ANYTHING BETWEEN ROSAMOND AND MR
LYDGATE
 SAID MRS
 BULSTRODE RATHER MORTIFIED AT FINDING OUT HER OWNIGNORANCE
IS IT POSSIBLE YOU DONT KNOW HARRIET
OH I GO ABOUT SO LITTLE AND I AM NOT FOND OF GOSSIP I REALLY NEVERHEAR ANY
 YOU SEE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT I DONT SEE
 YOUR CIRCLE ISRATHER DIFFERENT FROM OURS
WELL BUT YOUR OWN NIECE AND MR
 BULSTRODES GREAT FAVORITEAND YOURSTOO I AM SURE HARRIET
 I THOUGHT AT ONE TIME YOU MEANT HIM FORKATE WHEN SHE IS A LITTLE OLDER
I DONT BELIEVE THERE CAN BE ANYTHING SERIOUS AT PRESENT SAID MRS
BULSTRODE
 MY BROTHER WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TOLD ME
WELL PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT NOBODY CAN SEEMISS VINCY AND MR
 LYDGATE TOGETHER WITHOUT TAKING THEM TO BE ENGAGED
HOWEVER IT IS NOT MY BUSINESS
 SHALL I PUT UP THE PATTERN OF MITTENS
AFTER THIS MRS
 BULSTRODE DROVE TO HER NIECE WITH A MIND NEWLYWEIGHTED
 SHE WAS HERSELF HANDSOMELY DRESSED BUT SHE NOTICED WITH ALITTLE MORE REGRET THAN USUAL THAT ROSAMOND WHO WAS JUST COME IN ANDMET HER IN WALKINGDRESS WAS ALMOST AS EXPENSIVELY EQUIPPED
 MRS
BULSTRODE WAS A FEMININE SMALLER EDITION OF HER BROTHER AND HAD NONEOF HER HUSBANDS LOWTONED PALLOR
 SHE HAD A GOOD HONEST GLANCE ANDUSED NO CIRCUMLOCUTION
YOU ARE ALONE I SEE MY DEAR SHE SAID AS THEY ENTERED THEDRAWINGROOM TOGETHER LOOKING ROUND GRAVELY
 ROSAMOND FELT SURE THATHER AUNT HAD SOMETHING PARTICULAR TO SAY AND THEY SAT DOWN NEAR EACHOTHER
 NEVERTHELESS THE QUILLING INSIDE ROSAMONDS BONNET WAS SOCHARMING THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO DESIRE THE SAME KIND OF THINGFOR KATE AND MRS
 BULSTRODES EYES WHICH WERE RATHER FINE ROLLEDROUND THAT AMPLE QUILLED CIRCUIT WHILE SHE SPOKE
I HAVE JUST HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT YOU THAT HAS SURPRISED ME VERY MUCHROSAMOND
WHAT IS THAT AUNT
 ROSAMONDS EYES ALSO WERE ROAMING OVER HER AUNTSLARGE EMBROIDERED COLLAR
I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE ITTHAT YOU SHOULD BE ENGAGED WITHOUT MY KNOWINGITWITHOUT YOUR FATHERS TELLING ME
 HERE MRS
 BULSTRODES EYESFINALLY RESTED ON ROSAMONDS WHO BLUSHED DEEPLY AND SAIDI AM NOT ENGAGED AUNT
HOW IS IT THAT EVERY ONE SAYS SO THENTHAT IT IS THE TOWNS TALK
THE TOWNS TALK IS OF VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE I THINK SAIDROSAMOND INWARDLY GRATIFIED
OH MY DEAR BE MORE THOUGHTFUL DONT DESPISE YOUR NEIGHBORS SO
REMEMBER YOU ARE TURNED TWENTYTWO NOW AND YOU WILL HAVE NO FORTUNEYOUR FATHER I AM SURE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SPARE YOU ANYTHING
 MR
LYDGATE IS VERY INTELLECTUAL AND CLEVER I KNOW THERE IS AN ATTRACTIONIN THAT
 I LIKE TALKING TO SUCH MEN MYSELF AND YOUR UNCLE FINDS HIMVERY USEFUL
 BUT THE PROFESSION IS A POOR ONE HERE
 TO BE SURE THISLIFE IS NOT EVERYTHING BUT IT IS SELDOM A MEDICAL MAN HAS TRUERELIGIOUS VIEWSTHERE IS TOO MUCH PRIDE OF INTELLECT
 AND YOU ARE NOTFIT TO MARRY A POOR MAN
MR
 LYDGATE IS NOT A POOR MAN AUNT
 HE HAS VERY HIGH CONNECTIONS
HE TOLD ME HIMSELF HE WAS POOR
THAT IS BECAUSE HE IS USED TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE A HIGH STYLE OF LIVING
MY DEAR ROSAMOND YOU MUST NOT THINK OF LIVING IN HIGH STYLE
ROSAMOND LOOKED DOWN AND PLAYED WITH HER RETICULE
 SHE WAS NOT A FIERYYOUNG LADY AND HAD NO SHARP ANSWERS BUT SHE MEANT TO LIVE AS SHEPLEASED
THEN IT IS REALLY TRUE
 SAID MRS
 BULSTRODE LOOKING VERY EARNESTLYAT HER NIECE
 YOU ARE THINKING OF MR
 LYDGATETHERE IS SOMEUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN YOU THOUGH YOUR FATHER DOESNT KNOW
 BE OPEN MYDEAR ROSAMOND MR
 LYDGATE HAS REALLY MADE YOU AN OFFER
POOR ROSAMONDS FEELINGS WERE VERY UNPLEASANT
 SHE HAD BEEN QUITE EASYAS TO LYDGATES FEELING AND INTENTION BUT NOW WHEN HER AUNT PUT THISQUESTION SHE DID NOT LIKE BEING UNABLE TO SAY YES
 HER PRIDE WAS HURTBUT HER HABITUAL CONTROL OF MANNER HELPED HER
PRAY EXCUSE ME AUNT
 I WOULD RATHER NOT SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT
YOU WOULD NOT GIVE YOUR HEART TO A MAN WITHOUT A DECIDED PROSPECT ITRUST MY DEAR
 AND THINK OF THE TWO EXCELLENT OFFERS I KNOW OF THATYOU HAVE REFUSED
AND ONE STILL WITHIN YOUR REACH IF YOU WILL NOTTHROW IT AWAY
 I KNEW A VERY GREAT BEAUTY WHO MARRIED BADLY AT LAST BYDOING SO
 MR
 NED PLYMDALE IS A NICE YOUNG MANSOME MIGHT THINKGOODLOOKING AND AN ONLY SON AND A LARGE BUSINESS OF THAT KIND ISBETTER THAN A PROFESSION
 NOT THAT MARRYING IS EVERYTHING
 I WOULD HAVEYOU SEEK FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD
 BUT A GIRL SHOULD KEEP HER HEARTWITHIN HER OWN POWER
I SHOULD NEVER GIVE IT TO MR
 NED PLYMDALE IF IT WERE
 I HAVE ALREADYREFUSED HIM
 IF I LOVED I SHOULD LOVE AT ONCE AND WITHOUT CHANGESAID ROSAMOND WITH A GREAT SENSE OF BEING A ROMANTIC HEROINE ANDPLAYING THE PART PRETTILY
I SEE HOW IT IS MY DEAR SAID MRS
 BULSTRODE IN A MELANCHOLY VOICERISING TO GO
 YOU HAVE ALLOWED YOUR AFFECTIONS TO BE ENGAGED WITHOUTRETURN
NO INDEED AUNT SAID ROSAMOND WITH EMPHASIS
THEN YOU ARE QUITE CONFIDENT THAT MR
 LYDGATE HAS A SERIOUS ATTACHMENTTO YOU
ROSAMONDS CHEEKS BY THIS TIME WERE PERSISTENTLY BURNING AND SHE FELTMUCH MORTIFICATION
 SHE CHOSE TO BE SILENT AND HER AUNT WENT AWAY ALLTHE MORE CONVINCED
MR
 BULSTRODE IN THINGS WORLDLY AND INDIFFERENT WAS DISPOSED TO DO WHATHIS WIFE BADE HIM AND SHE NOW WITHOUT TELLING HER REASONS DESIREDHIM ON THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OUT IN CONVERSATION WITH MR
LYDGATE WHETHER HE HAD ANY INTENTION OF MARRYING SOON
 THE RESULT WAS ADECIDED NEGATIVE
 MR
 BULSTRODE ON BEING CROSSQUESTIONED SHOWED THATLYDGATE HAD SPOKEN AS NO MAN WOULD WHO HAD ANY ATTACHMENT THAT COULDISSUE IN MATRIMONY
 MRS
 BULSTRODE NOW FELT THAT SHE HAD A SERIOUS DUTYBEFORE HER AND SHE SOON MANAGED TO ARRANGE A TÊTEÀTÊTE WITHLYDGATE IN WHICH SHE PASSED FROM INQUIRIES ABOUT FRED VINCYS HEALTHAND EXPRESSIONS OF HER SINCERE ANXIETY FOR HER BROTHERS LARGE FAMILYTO GENERAL REMARKS ON THE DANGERS WHICH LAY BEFORE YOUNG PEOPLE WITHREGARD TO THEIR SETTLEMENT IN LIFE
 YOUNG MEN WERE OFTEN WILD ANDDISAPPOINTING MAKING LITTLE RETURN FOR THE MONEY SPENT ON THEM AND AGIRL WAS EXPOSED TO MANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MIGHT INTERFERE WITH HERPROSPECTS
ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE HAS GREAT ATTRACTIONS AND HER PARENTS SEE MUCHCOMPANY SAID MRS
 BULSTRODE
 GENTLEMEN PAY HER ATTENTION ANDENGROSS HER ALL TO THEMSELVES FOR THE MERE PLEASURE OF THE MOMENT ANDTHAT DRIVES OFF OTHERS
 I THINK IT IS A HEAVY RESPONSIBILITY MR
LYDGATE TO INTERFERE WITH THE PROSPECTS OF ANY GIRL
 HERE MRS
BULSTRODE FIXED HER EYES ON HIM WITH AN UNMISTAKABLE PURPOSE OFWARNING IF NOT OF REBUKE
CLEARLY SAID LYDGATE LOOKING AT HERPERHAPS EVEN STARING A LITTLEIN RETURN
 ON THE OTHER HAND A MAN MUST BE A GREAT COXCOMB TO GOABOUT WITH A NOTION THAT HE MUST NOT PAY ATTENTION TO A YOUNG LADY LESTSHE SHOULD FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM OR LEST OTHERS SHOULD THINK SHEMUST
OH MR
 LYDGATE YOU KNOW WELL WHAT YOUR ADVANTAGES ARE
 YOU KNOW THATOUR YOUNG MEN HERE CANNOT COPE WITH YOU
 WHERE YOU FREQUENT A HOUSE ITMAY MILITATE VERY MUCH AGAINST A GIRLS MAKING A DESIRABLE SETTLEMENTIN LIFE AND PREVENT HER FROM ACCEPTING OFFERS EVEN IF THEY ARE MADE
LYDGATE WAS LESS FLATTERED BY HIS ADVANTAGE OVER THE MIDDLEMARCHORLANDOS THAN HE WAS ANNOYED BY THE PERCEPTION OF MRS
 BULSTRODESMEANING
 SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN AS IMPRESSIVELY AS IT WASNECESSARY TO DO AND THAT IN USING THE SUPERIOR WORD MILITATE SHE HADTHROWN A NOBLE DRAPERY OVER A MASS OF PARTICULARS WHICH WERE STILLEVIDENT ENOUGH
LYDGATE WAS FUMING A LITTLE PUSHED HIS HAIR BACK WITH ONE HAND FELTCURIOUSLY IN HIS WAISTCOATPOCKET WITH THE OTHER AND THEN STOOPED TOBECKON THE TINY BLACK SPANIEL WHICH HAD THE INSIGHT TO DECLINE HISHOLLOW CARESSES
 IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DECENT TO GO AWAY BECAUSE HEHAD BEEN DINING WITH OTHER GUESTS AND HAD JUST TAKEN TEA
 BUT MRS
BULSTRODE HAVING NO DOUBT THAT SHE HAD BEEN UNDERSTOOD TURNED THECONVERSATION
SOLOMONS PROVERBS I THINK HAVE OMITTED TO SAY THAT AS THE SOREPALATE FINDETH GRIT SO AN UNEASY CONSCIOUSNESS HEARETH INNUENDOES
 THENEXT DAY MR
 FAREBROTHER PARTING FROM LYDGATE IN THE STREET SUPPOSEDTHAT THEY SHOULD MEET AT VINCYS IN THE EVENING
 LYDGATE ANSWEREDCURTLY NOHE HAD WORK TO DOHE MUST GIVE UP GOING OUT IN THE EVENING
WHAT
 YOU ARE GOING TO GET LASHED TO THE MAST EH AND ARE STOPPINGYOUR EARS
 SAID THE VICAR
 WELL IF YOU DONT MEAN TO BE WON BY THESIRENS YOU ARE RIGHT TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS IN TIME
A FEW DAYS BEFORE LYDGATE WOULD HAVE TAKEN NO NOTICE OF THESE WORDS ASANYTHING MORE THAN THE VICARS USUAL WAY OF PUTTING THINGS
 THEY SEEMEDNOW TO CONVEY AN INNUENDO WHICH CONFIRMED THE IMPRESSION THAT HE HADBEEN MAKING A FOOL OF HIMSELF AND BEHAVING SO AS TO BE MISUNDERSTOODNOT HE BELIEVED BY ROSAMOND HERSELF SHE HE FELT SURE TOOKEVERYTHING AS LIGHTLY AS HE INTENDED IT
 SHE HAD AN EXQUISITE TACT ANDINSIGHT IN RELATION TO ALL POINTS OF MANNERS BUT THE PEOPLE SHE LIVEDAMONG WERE BLUNDERERS AND BUSYBODIES
 HOWEVER THE MISTAKE SHOULD GO NOFARTHER
 HE RESOLVEDAND KEPT HIS RESOLUTIONTHAT HE WOULD NOT GO TOMR
 VINCYS EXCEPT ON BUSINESS
ROSAMOND BECAME VERY UNHAPPY
 THE UNEASINESS FIRST STIRRED BY HERAUNTS QUESTIONS GREW AND GREW TILL AT THE END OF TEN DAYS THAT SHE HADNOT SEEN LYDGATE IT GREW INTO TERROR AT THE BLANK THAT MIGHT POSSIBLYCOMEINTO FOREBODING OF THAT READY FATAL SPONGE WHICH SO CHEAPLY WIPESOUT THE HOPES OF MORTALS
 THE WORLD WOULD HAVE A NEW DREARINESS FORHER AS A WILDERNESS THAT A MAGICIANS SPELLS HAD TURNED FOR A LITTLEWHILE INTO A GARDEN
 SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS BEGINNING TO KNOW THE PANGOF DISAPPOINTED LOVE AND THAT NO OTHER MAN COULD BE THE OCCASION OFSUCH DELIGHTFUL AERIAL BUILDING AS SHE HAD BEEN ENJOYING FOR THE LASTSIX MONTHS
 POOR ROSAMOND LOST HER APPETITE AND FELT AS FORLORN ASARIADNEAS A CHARMING STAGE ARIADNE LEFT BEHIND WITH ALL HER BOXES FULLOF COSTUMES AND NO HOPE OF A COACH
THERE ARE MANY WONDERFUL MIXTURES IN THE WORLD WHICH ARE ALL ALIKECALLED LOVE AND CLAIM THE PRIVILEGES OF A SUBLIME RAGE WHICH IS ANAPOLOGY FOR EVERYTHING IN LITERATURE AND THE DRAMA
 HAPPILY ROSAMONDDID NOT THINK OF COMMITTING ANY DESPERATE ACT SHE PLAITED HER FAIRHAIR AS BEAUTIFULLY AS USUAL AND KEPT HERSELF PROUDLY CALM
 HER MOSTCHEERFUL SUPPOSITION WAS THAT HER AUNT BULSTRODE HAD INTERFERED IN SOMEWAY TO HINDER LYDGATES VISITS EVERYTHING WAS BETTER THAN ASPONTANEOUS INDIFFERENCE IN HIM
 ANY ONE WHO IMAGINES TEN DAYS TOOSHORT A TIMENOT FOR FALLING INTO LEANNESS LIGHTNESS OR OTHERMEASURABLE EFFECTS OF PASSION BUTFOR THE WHOLE SPIRITUAL CIRCUIT OFALARMED CONJECTURE AND DISAPPOINTMENT IS IGNORANT OF WHAT CAN GO ON INTHE ELEGANT LEISURE OF A YOUNG LADYS MIND
ON THE ELEVENTH DAY HOWEVER LYDGATE WHEN LEAVING STONE COURT WASREQUESTED BY MRS
 VINCY TO LET HER HUSBAND KNOW THAT THERE WAS A MARKEDCHANGE IN MR
 FEATHERSTONES HEALTH AND THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO COME TOSTONE COURT ON THAT DAY
 NOW LYDGATE MIGHT HAVE CALLED AT THEWAREHOUSE OR MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN A MESSAGE ON A LEAF OF HIS POCKETBOOKAND LEFT IT AT THE DOOR
 YET THESE SIMPLE DEVICES APPARENTLY DID NOTOCCUR TO HIM FROM WHICH WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT HE HAD NO STRONGOBJECTION TO CALLING AT THE HOUSE AT AN HOUR WHEN MR
 VINCY WAS NOT ATHOME AND LEAVING THE MESSAGE WITH MISS VINCY
 A MAN MAY FROM VARIOUSMOTIVES DECLINE TO GIVE HIS COMPANY BUT PERHAPS NOT EVEN A SAGE WOULDBE GRATIFIED THAT NOBODY MISSED HIM
 IT WOULD BE A GRACEFUL EASY WAYOF PIECING ON THE NEW HABITS TO THE OLD TO HAVE A FEW PLAYFUL WORDSWITH ROSAMOND ABOUT HIS RESISTANCE TO DISSIPATION AND HIS FIRM RESOLVETO TAKE LONG FASTS EVEN FROM SWEET SOUNDS
 IT MUST BE CONFESSED ALSOTHAT MOMENTARY SPECULATIONS AS TO ALL THE POSSIBLE GROUNDS FOR MRS
BULSTRODES HINTS HAD MANAGED TO GET WOVEN LIKE SLIGHT CLINGING HAIRSINTO THE MORE SUBSTANTIAL WEB OF HIS THOUGHTS
MISS VINCY WAS ALONE AND BLUSHED SO DEEPLY WHEN LYDGATE CAME IN THATHE FELT A CORRESPONDING EMBARRASSMENT AND INSTEAD OF ANY PLAYFULNESSHE BEGAN AT ONCE TO SPEAK OF HIS REASON FOR CALLING AND TO BEG HERALMOST FORMALLY TO DELIVER THE MESSAGE TO HER FATHER
 ROSAMOND WHO ATTHE FIRST MOMENT FELT AS IF HER HAPPINESS WERE RETURNING WAS KEENLYHURT BY LYDGATES MANNER HER BLUSH HAD DEPARTED AND SHE ASSENTEDCOLDLY WITHOUT ADDING AN UNNECESSARY WORD SOME TRIVIAL CHAINWORKWHICH SHE HAD IN HER HANDS ENABLING HER TO AVOID LOOKING AT LYDGATEHIGHER THAN HIS CHIN
 IN ALL FAILURES THE BEGINNING IS CERTAINLY THEHALF OF THE WHOLE
 AFTER SITTING TWO LONG MOMENTS WHILE HE MOVED HISWHIP AND COULD SAY NOTHING LYDGATE ROSE TO GO AND ROSAMOND MADENERVOUS BY HER STRUGGLE BETWEEN MORTIFICATION AND THE WISH NOT TOBETRAY IT DROPPED HER CHAIN AS IF STARTLED AND ROSE TOOMECHANICALLY
 LYDGATE INSTANTANEOUSLY STOOPED TO PICK UP THE CHAIN
WHEN HE ROSE HE WAS VERY NEAR TO A LOVELY LITTLE FACE SET ON A FAIRLONG NECK WHICH HE HAD BEEN USED TO SEE TURNING ABOUT UNDER THE MOSTPERFECT MANAGEMENT OF SELFCONTENTED GRACE
 BUT AS HE RAISED HIS EYESNOW HE SAW A CERTAIN HELPLESS QUIVERING WHICH TOUCHED HIM QUITE NEWLYAND MADE HIM LOOK AT ROSAMOND WITH A QUESTIONING FLASH
 AT THIS MOMENTSHE WAS AS NATURAL AS SHE HAD EVER BEEN WHEN SHE WAS FIVE YEARS OLDSHE FELT THAT HER TEARS HAD RISEN AND IT WAS NO USE TO TRY TO DOANYTHING ELSE THAN LET THEM STAY LIKE WATER ON A BLUE FLOWER OR LETTHEM FALL OVER HER CHEEKS EVEN AS THEY WOULD
THAT MOMENT OF NATURALNESS WAS THE CRYSTALLIZING FEATHERTOUCH ITSHOOK FLIRTATION INTO LOVE
 REMEMBER THAT THE AMBITIOUS MAN WHO WASLOOKING AT THOSE FORGETMENOTS UNDER THE WATER WAS VERY WARMHEARTEDAND RASH
 HE DID NOT KNOW WHERE THE CHAIN WENT AN IDEA HAD THRILLEDTHROUGH THE RECESSES WITHIN HIM WHICH HAD A MIRACULOUS EFFECT INRAISING THE POWER OF PASSIONATE LOVE LYING BURIED THERE IN NO SEALEDSEPULCHRE BUT UNDER THE LIGHTEST EASILY PIERCED MOULD
 HIS WORDS WEREQUITE ABRUPT AND AWKWARD BUT THE TONE MADE THEM SOUND LIKE AN ARDENTAPPEALING AVOWAL
WHAT IS THE MATTER
 YOU ARE DISTRESSED
 TELL ME PRAY
ROSAMOND HAD NEVER BEEN SPOKEN TO IN SUCH TONES BEFORE
 I AM NOT SURETHAT SHE KNEW WHAT THE WORDS WERE BUT SHE LOOKED AT LYDGATE AND THETEARS FELL OVER HER CHEEKS
 THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NO MORE COMPLETEANSWER THAN THAT SILENCE AND LYDGATE FORGETTING EVERYTHING ELSECOMPLETELY MASTERED BY THE OUTRUSH OF TENDERNESS AT THE SUDDEN BELIEFTHAT THIS SWEET YOUNG CREATURE DEPENDED ON HIM FOR HER JOY ACTUALLYPUT HIS ARMS ROUND HER FOLDING HER GENTLY AND PROTECTINGLYHE WAS USEDTO BEING GENTLE WITH THE WEAK AND SUFFERINGAND KISSED EACH OF THE TWOLARGE TEARS
 THIS WAS A STRANGE WAY OF ARRIVING AT AN UNDERSTANDINGBUT IT WAS A SHORT WAY
 ROSAMOND WAS NOT ANGRY BUT SHE MOVED BACKWARDA LITTLE IN TIMID HAPPINESS AND LYDGATE COULD NOW SIT NEAR HER ANDSPEAK LESS INCOMPLETELY
 ROSAMOND HAD TO MAKE HER LITTLE CONFESSIONAND HE POURED OUT WORDS OF GRATITUDE AND TENDERNESS WITH IMPULSIVELAVISHMENT
 IN HALF AN HOUR HE LEFT THE HOUSE AN ENGAGED MAN WHOSESOUL WAS NOT HIS OWN BUT THE WOMANS TO WHOM HE HAD BOUND HIMSELF
HE CAME AGAIN IN THE EVENING TO SPEAK WITH MR
 VINCY WHO JUSTRETURNED FROM STONE COURT WAS FEELING SURE THAT IT WOULD NOT BE LONGBEFORE HE HEARD OF MR
 FEATHERSTONES DEMISE
 THE FELICITOUS WORDDEMISE WHICH HAD SEASONABLY OCCURRED TO HIM HAD RAISED HIS SPIRITSEVEN ABOVE THEIR USUAL EVENING PITCH
 THE RIGHT WORD IS ALWAYS A POWERAND COMMUNICATES ITS DEFINITENESS TO OUR ACTION
 CONSIDERED AS ADEMISE OLD FEATHERSTONES DEATH ASSUMED A MERELY LEGAL ASPECT SO THATMR
 VINCY COULD TAP HIS SNUFFBOX OVER IT AND BE JOVIAL WITHOUT EVENAN INTERMITTENT AFFECTATION OF SOLEMNITY AND MR
 VINCY HATED BOTHSOLEMNITY AND AFFECTATION
 WHO WAS EVER AWE STRUCK ABOUT A TESTATOR ORSANG A HYMN ON THE TITLE TO REAL PROPERTY
 MR
 VINCY WAS INCLINED TOTAKE A JOVIAL VIEW OF ALL THINGS THAT EVENING HE EVEN OBSERVED TOLYDGATE THAT FRED HAD GOT THE FAMILY CONSTITUTION AFTER ALL AND WOULDSOON BE AS FINE A FELLOW AS EVER AGAIN AND WHEN HIS APPROBATION OFROSAMONDS ENGAGEMENT WAS ASKED FOR HE GAVE IT WITH ASTONISHINGFACILITY PASSING AT ONCE TO GENERAL REMARKS ON THE DESIRABLENESS OFMATRIMONY FOR YOUNG MEN AND MAIDENS AND APPARENTLY DEDUCING FROM THEWHOLE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF A LITTLE MORE PUNCH
CHAPTER XXXII
THEYLL TAKE SUGGESTION AS A CAT LAPS MILK
SHAKESPEARE TEMPEST
THE TRIUMPHANT CONFIDENCE OF THE MAYOR FOUNDED ON MR
 FEATHERSTONESINSISTENT DEMAND THAT FRED AND HIS MOTHER SHOULD NOT LEAVE HIM WAS AFEEBLE EMOTION COMPARED WITH ALL THAT WAS AGITATING THE BREASTS OF THEOLD MANS BLOODRELATIONS WHO NATURALLY MANIFESTED MORE THEIR SENSE OFTHE FAMILY TIE AND WERE MORE VISIBLY NUMEROUS NOW THAT HE HAD BECOMEBEDRIDDEN
 NATURALLY FOR WHEN POOR PETER HAD OCCUPIED HIS ARMCHAIRIN THE WAINSCOTED PARLOR NO ASSIDUOUS BEETLES FOR WHOM THE COOKPREPARES BOILING WATER COULD HAVE BEEN LESS WELCOME ON A HEARTH WHICHTHEY HAD REASONS FOR PREFERRING THAN THOSE PERSONS WHOSE FEATHERSTONEBLOOD WAS ILLNOURISHED NOT FROM PENURIOUSNESS ON THEIR PART BUT FROMPOVERTY
 BROTHER SOLOMON AND SISTER JANE WERE RICH AND THE FAMILYCANDOR AND TOTAL ABSTINENCE FROM FALSE POLITENESS WITH WHICH THEY WEREALWAYS RECEIVED SEEMED TO THEM NO ARGUMENT THAT THEIR BROTHER IN THESOLEMN ACT OF MAKING HIS WILL WOULD OVERLOOK THE SUPERIOR CLAIMS OFWEALTH
 THEMSELVES AT LEAST HE HAD NEVER BEEN UNNATURAL ENOUGH TOBANISH FROM HIS HOUSE AND IT SEEMED HARDLY ECCENTRIC THAT HE SHOULDHAVE KEPT AWAY BROTHER JONAH SISTER MARTHA AND THE REST WHO HAD NOSHADOW OF SUCH CLAIMS
 THEY KNEW PETERS MAXIM THAT MONEY WAS A GOODEGG AND SHOULD BE LAID IN A WARM NEST
BUT BROTHER JONAH SISTER MARTHA AND ALL THE NEEDY EXILES HELD ADIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW
 PROBABILITIES ARE AS VARIOUS AS THE FACES TOBE SEEN AT WILL IN FRETWORK OR PAPERHANGINGS EVERY FORM IS THEREFROM JUPITER TO JUDY IF YOU ONLY LOOK WITH CREATIVE INCLINATION
 TOTHE POORER AND LEAST FAVORED IT SEEMED LIKELY THAT SINCE PETER HAD DONENOTHING FOR THEM IN HIS LIFE HE WOULD REMEMBER THEM AT THE LAST
 JONAHARGUED THAT MEN LIKED TO MAKE A SURPRISE OF THEIR WILLS WHILE MARTHASAID THAT NOBODY NEED BE SURPRISED IF HE LEFT THE BEST PART OF HISMONEY TO THOSE WHO LEAST EXPECTED IT
 ALSO IT WAS NOT TO BE THOUGHT BUTTHAT AN OWN BROTHER LYING THERE WITH DROPSY IN HIS LEGS MUST COME TOFEEL THAT BLOOD WAS THICKER THAN WATER AND IF HE DIDNT ALTER HISWILL HE MIGHT HAVE MONEY BY HIM
 AT ANY RATE SOME BLOODRELATIONSSHOULD BE ON THE PREMISES AND ON THE WATCH AGAINST THOSE WHO WEREHARDLY RELATIONS AT ALL
 SUCH THINGS HAD BEEN KNOWN AS FORGED WILLS ANDDISPUTED WILLS WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE THE GOLDENHAZY ADVANTAGE OFSOMEHOW ENABLING NONLEGATEES TO LIVE OUT OF THEM
 AGAIN THOSE WHOWERE NO BLOODRELATIONS MIGHT BE CAUGHT MAKING AWAY WITH THINGSANDPOOR PETER LYING THERE HELPLESS
 SOMEBODY SHOULD BE ON THE WATCH
 BUTIN THIS CONCLUSION THEY WERE AT ONE WITH SOLOMON AND JANE ALSO SOMENEPHEWS NIECES AND COUSINS ARGUING WITH STILL GREATER SUBTILTY AS TOWHAT MIGHT BE DONE BY A MAN ABLE TO WILL AWAY HIS PROPERTY AND GIVEHIMSELF LARGE TREATS OF ODDITY FELT IN A HANDSOME SORT OF WAY THATTHERE WAS A FAMILY INTEREST TO BE ATTENDED TO AND THOUGHT OF STONECOURT AS A PLACE WHICH IT WOULD BE NOTHING BUT RIGHT FOR THEM TO VISIT
SISTER MARTHA OTHERWISE MRS
 CRANCH LIVING WITH SOME WHEEZINESS INTHE CHALKY FLATS COULD NOT UNDERTAKE THE JOURNEY BUT HER SON ASBEING POOR PETERS OWN NEPHEW COULD REPRESENT HER ADVANTAGEOUSLY ANDWATCH LEST HIS UNCLE JONAH SHOULD MAKE AN UNFAIR USE OF THE IMPROBABLETHINGS WHICH SEEMED LIKELY TO HAPPEN
 IN FACT THERE WAS A GENERAL SENSERUNNING IN THE FEATHERSTONE BLOOD THAT EVERYBODY MUST WATCH EVERYBODYELSE AND THAT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR EVERYBODY ELSE TO REFLECT THAT THEALMIGHTY WAS WATCHING HIM
THUS STONE COURT CONTINUALLY SAW ONE OR OTHER BLOODRELATION ALIGHTINGOR DEPARTING AND MARY GARTH HAD THE UNPLEASANT TASK OF CARRYING THEIRMESSAGES TO MR
 FEATHERSTONE WHO WOULD SEE NONE OF THEM AND SENT HERDOWN WITH THE STILL MORE UNPLEASANT TASK OF TELLING THEM SO
 AS MANAGEROF THE HOUSEHOLD SHE FELT BOUND TO ASK THEM IN GOOD PROVINCIAL FASHIONTO STAY AND EAT BUT SHE CHOSE TO CONSULT MRS
 VINCY ON THE POINT OFEXTRA DOWNSTAIRS CONSUMPTION NOW THAT MR
 FEATHERSTONE WAS LAID UP
OH MY DEAR YOU MUST DO THINGS HANDSOMELY WHERE THERES LAST ILLNESSAND A PROPERTY
 GOD KNOWS I DONT GRUDGE THEM EVERY HAM IN THEHOUSEONLY SAVE THE BEST FOR THE FUNERAL
 HAVE SOME STUFFED VEALALWAYS AND A FINE CHEESE IN CUT
 YOU MUST EXPECT TO KEEP OPEN HOUSE INTHESE LAST ILLNESSES SAID LIBERAL MRS
 VINCY ONCE MORE OF CHEERFULNOTE AND BRIGHT PLUMAGE
BUT SOME OF THE VISITORS ALIGHTED AND DID NOT DEPART AFTER THE HANDSOMETREATING TO VEAL AND HAM
 BROTHER JONAH FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE SUCHUNPLEASANT PEOPLE IN MOST FAMILIES PERHAPS EVEN IN THE HIGHESTARISTOCRACY THERE ARE BROBDINGNAG SPECIMENS GIGANTICALLY IN DEBT ANDBLOATED AT GREATER EXPENSEBROTHER JONAH I SAY HAVING COME DOWN INTHE WORLD WAS MAINLY SUPPORTED BY A CALLING WHICH HE WAS MODEST ENOUGHNOT TO BOAST OF THOUGH IT WAS MUCH BETTER THAN SWINDLING EITHER ONEXCHANGE OR TURF BUT WHICH DID NOT REQUIRE HIS PRESENCE AT BRASSING SOLONG AS HE HAD A GOOD CORNER TO SIT IN AND A SUPPLY OF FOOD
 HE CHOSETHE KITCHENCORNER PARTLY BECAUSE HE LIKED IT BEST AND PARTLY BECAUSEHE DID NOT WANT TO SIT WITH SOLOMON CONCERNING WHOM HE HAD A STRONGBROTHERLY OPINION
 SEATED IN A FAMOUS ARMCHAIR AND IN HIS BEST SUITCONSTANTLY WITHIN SIGHT OF GOOD CHEER HE HAD A COMFORTABLECONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING ON THE PREMISES MINGLED WITH FLEETINGSUGGESTIONS OF SUNDAY AND THE BAR AT THE GREEN MAN AND HE INFORMEDMARY GARTH THAT HE SHOULD NOT GO OUT OF REACH OF HIS BROTHER PETERWHILE THAT POOR FELLOW WAS ABOVE GROUND
 THE TROUBLESOME ONES IN AFAMILY ARE USUALLY EITHER THE WITS OR THE IDIOTS
 JONAH WAS THE WITAMONG THE FEATHERSTONES AND JOKED WITH THE MAIDSERVANTS WHEN THEYCAME ABOUT THE HEARTH BUT SEEMED TO CONSIDER MISS GARTH A SUSPICIOUSCHARACTER AND FOLLOWED HER WITH COLD EYES
MARY WOULD HAVE BORNE THIS ONE PAIR OF EYES WITH COMPARATIVE EASE BUTUNFORTUNATELY THERE WAS YOUNG CRANCH WHO HAVING COME ALL THE WAY FROMTHE CHALKY FLATS TO REPRESENT HIS MOTHER AND WATCH HIS UNCLE JONAHALSO FELT IT HIS DUTY TO STAY AND TO SIT CHIEFLY IN THE KITCHEN TO GIVEHIS UNCLE COMPANY
 YOUNG CRANCH WAS NOT EXACTLY THE BALANCING POINTBETWEEN THE WIT AND THE IDIOTVERGING SLIGHTLY TOWARDS THE LATTERTYPE AND SQUINTING SO AS TO LEAVE EVERYTHING IN DOUBT ABOUT HISSENTIMENTS EXCEPT THAT THEY WERE NOT OF A FORCIBLE CHARACTER
 WHEN MARYGARTH ENTERED THE KITCHEN AND MR
 JONAH FEATHERSTONE BEGAN TO FOLLOWHER WITH HIS COLD DETECTIVE EYES YOUNG CRANCH TURNING HIS HEAD IN THESAME DIRECTION SEEMED TO INSIST ON IT THAT SHE SHOULD REMARK HOW HE WASSQUINTING AS IF HE DID IT WITH DESIGN LIKE THE GYPSIES WHEN BORROWREAD THE NEW TESTAMENT TO THEM
 THIS WAS RATHER TOO MUCH FOR POOR MARYSOMETIMES IT MADE HER BILIOUS SOMETIMES IT UPSET HER GRAVITY
 ONE DAYTHAT SHE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY SHE COULD NOT RESIST DESCRIBING THE KITCHENSCENE TO FRED WHO WOULD NOT BE HINDERED FROM IMMEDIATELY GOING TO SEEIT AFFECTING SIMPLY TO PASS THROUGH
 BUT NO SOONER DID HE FACE THEFOUR EYES THAN HE HAD TO RUSH THROUGH THE NEAREST DOOR WHICH HAPPENEDTO LEAD TO THE DAIRY AND THERE UNDER THE HIGH ROOF AND AMONG THE PANSHE GAVE WAY TO LAUGHTER WHICH MADE A HOLLOW RESONANCE PERFECTLY AUDIBLEIN THE KITCHEN
 HE FLED BY ANOTHER DOORWAY BUT MR
 JONAH WHO HAD NOTBEFORE SEEN FREDS WHITE COMPLEXION LONG LEGS AND PINCHED DELICACY OFFACE PREPARED MANY SARCASMS IN WHICH THESE POINTS OF APPEARANCE WEREWITTILY COMBINED WITH THE LOWEST MORAL ATTRIBUTES
WHY TOM YOU DONT WEAR SUCH GENTLEMANLY TROUSERSYOU HAVENT GOTHALF SUCH FINE LONG LEGS SAID JONAH TO HIS NEPHEW WINKING AT THESAME TIME TO IMPLY THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE IN THESE STATEMENTSTHAN THEIR UNDENIABLENESS
 TOM LOOKED AT HIS LEGS BUT LEFT ITUNCERTAIN WHETHER HE PREFERRED HIS MORAL ADVANTAGES TO A MORE VICIOUSLENGTH OF LIMB AND REPREHENSIBLE GENTILITY OF TROUSER
IN THE LARGE WAINSCOTED PARLOR TOO THERE WERE CONSTANTLY PAIRS OF EYESON THE WATCH AND OWN RELATIVES EAGER TO BE SITTERSUP
 MANY CAMELUNCHED AND DEPARTED BUT BROTHER SOLOMON AND THE LADY WHO HAD BEENJANE FEATHERSTONE FOR TWENTYFIVE YEARS BEFORE SHE WAS MRS
 WAULE FOUNDIT GOOD TO BE THERE EVERY DAY FOR HOURS WITHOUT OTHER CALCULABLEOCCUPATION THAN THAT OF OBSERVING THE CUNNING MARY GARTH WHO WAS SODEEP THAT SHE COULD BE FOUND OUT IN NOTHING AND GIVING OCCASIONAL DRYWRINKLY INDICATIONS OF CRYINGAS IF CAPABLE OF TORRENTS IN A WETTERSEASONAT THE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO INTO MR
FEATHERSTONES ROOM
 FOR THE OLD MANS DISLIKE OF HIS OWN FAMILY SEEMEDTO GET STRONGER AS HE GOT LESS ABLE TO AMUSE HIMSELF BY SAYING BITINGTHINGS TO THEM
 TOO LANGUID TO STING HE HAD THE MORE VENOM REFLUENT INHIS BLOOD
NOT FULLY BELIEVING THE MESSAGE SENT THROUGH MARY GARTH THEY HADPRESENTED THEMSELVES TOGETHER WITHIN THE DOOR OF THE BEDROOM BOTH INBLACKMRS
 WAULE HAVING A WHITE HANDKERCHIEF PARTIALLY UNFOLDED IN HERHANDAND BOTH WITH FACES IN A SORT OF HALFMOURNING PURPLE WHILE MRS
VINCY WITH HER PINK CHEEKS AND PINK RIBBONS FLYING WAS ACTUALLYADMINISTERING A CORDIAL TO THEIR OWN BROTHER AND THELIGHTCOMPLEXIONED FRED HIS SHORT HAIR CURLING AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED INA GAMBLERS WAS LOLLING AT HIS EASE IN A LARGE CHAIR
OLD FEATHERSTONE NO SOONER CAUGHT SIGHT OF THESE FUNEREAL FIGURESAPPEARING IN SPITE OF HIS ORDERS THAN RAGE CAME TO STRENGTHEN HIM MORESUCCESSFULLY THAN THE CORDIAL
 HE WAS PROPPED UP ON A BEDREST ANDALWAYS HAD HIS GOLDHEADED STICK LYING BY HIM
 HE SEIZED IT NOW ANDSWEPT IT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN AS LARGE AN AREA AS HE COULDAPPARENTLY TO BAN THESE UGLY SPECTRES CRYING IN A HOARSE SORT OFSCREECHBACK BACK MRS
 WAULE
 BACK SOLOMON
OH BROTHER
 PETER MRS
 WAULE BEGANBUT SOLOMON PUT HIS HAND BEFOREHER REPRESSINGLY
 HE WAS A LARGECHEEKED MAN NEARLY SEVENTY WITHSMALL FURTIVE EYES AND WAS NOT ONLY OF MUCH BLANDER TEMPER BUT THOUGHTHIMSELF MUCH DEEPER THAN HIS BROTHER PETER INDEED NOT LIKELY TO BEDECEIVED IN ANY OF HIS FELLOWMEN INASMUCH AS THEY COULD NOT WELL BEMORE GREEDY AND DECEITFUL THAN HE SUSPECTED THEM OF BEING
 EVEN THEINVISIBLE POWERS HE THOUGHT WERE LIKELY TO BE SOOTHED BY A BLANDPARENTHESIS HERE AND THERECOMING FROM A MAN OF PROPERTY WHO MIGHTHAVE BEEN AS IMPIOUS AS OTHERS
BROTHER PETER HE SAID IN A WHEEDLING YET GRAVELY OFFICIAL TONEITS NOTHING BUT RIGHT I SHOULD SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THE THREE CROFTSAND THE MANGANESE
 THE ALMIGHTY KNOWS WHAT IVE GOT ON MY MINDTHEN HE KNOWS MORE THAN I WANT TO KNOW SAID PETER LAYING DOWN HISSTICK WITH A SHOW OF TRUCE WHICH HAD A THREAT IN IT TOO FOR HEREVERSED THE STICK SO AS TO MAKE THE GOLD HANDLE A CLUB IN CASE OFCLOSER FIGHTING AND LOOKED HARD AT SOLOMONS BALD HEAD
THERES THINGS YOU MIGHT REPENT OF BROTHER FOR WANT OF SPEAKING TOME SAID SOLOMON NOT ADVANCING HOWEVER
 I COULD SIT UP WITH YOUTONIGHT AND JANE WITH ME WILLINGLY AND YOU MIGHT TAKE YOUR OWN TIMETO SPEAK OR LET ME SPEAK
YES I SHALL TAKE MY OWN TIMEYOU NEEDNT OFFER ME YOURS SAID PETER
BUT YOU CANT TAKE YOUR OWN TIME TO DIE IN BROTHER BEGAN MRS
WAULE WITH HER USUAL WOOLLY TONE
 AND WHEN YOU LIE SPEECHLESS YOU MAYBE TIRED OF HAVING STRANGERS ABOUT YOU AND YOU MAY THINK OF ME AND MYCHILDRENBUT HERE HER VOICE BROKE UNDER THE TOUCHING THOUGHT WHICH SHEWAS ATTRIBUTING TO HER SPEECHLESS BROTHER THE MENTION OF OURSELVESBEING NATURALLY AFFECTING
NO I SHANT SAID OLD FEATHERSTONE CONTRADICTIOUSLY
 I SHANTTHINK OF ANY OF YOU
 IVE MADE MY WILL I TELL YOU IVE MADE MY WILL
HERE HE TURNED HIS HEAD TOWARDS MRS
 VINCY AND SWALLOWED SOME MORE OFHIS CORDIAL
SOME PEOPLE WOULD BE ASHAMED TO FILL UP A PLACE BELONGING BY RIGHTS TOOTHERS SAID MRS
 WAULE TURNING HER NARROW EYES IN THE SAMEDIRECTION
OH SISTER SAID SOLOMON WITH IRONICAL SOFTNESS YOU AND ME ARE NOTFINE AND HANDSOME AND CLEVER ENOUGH WE MUST BE HUMBLE AND LET SMARTPEOPLE PUSH THEMSELVES BEFORE US
FREDS SPIRIT COULD NOT BEAR THIS RISING AND LOOKING AT MR
FEATHERSTONE HE SAID SHALL MY MOTHER AND I LEAVE THE ROOM SIR THATYOU MAY BE ALONE WITH YOUR FRIENDS
SIT DOWN I TELL YOU SAID OLD FEATHERSTONE SNAPPISHLY
 STOP WHEREYOU ARE
 GOODBY SOLOMON HE ADDED TRYING TO WIELD HIS STICK AGAINBUT FAILING NOW THAT HE HAD REVERSED THE HANDLE
 GOODBY MRS
 WAULE
DONT YOU COME AGAIN
I SHALL BE DOWNSTAIRS BROTHER WHETHER OR NO SAID SOLOMON
 ISHALL DO MY DUTY AND IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHAT THE ALMIGHTY WILLALLOW
YES IN PROPERTY GOING OUT OF FAMILIES SAID MRS
 WAULE INCONTINUATIONAND WHERE THERES STEADY YOUNG MEN TO CARRY ON
 BUT IPITY THEM WHO ARE NOT SUCH AND I PITY THEIR MOTHERS
 GOODBY BROTHERPETER
REMEMBER IM THE ELDEST AFTER YOU BROTHER AND PROSPERED FROM THEFIRST JUST AS YOU DID AND HAVE GOT LAND ALREADY BY THE NAME OFFEATHERSTONE SAID SOLOMON RELYING MUCH ON THAT REFLECTION AS ONEWHICH MIGHT BE SUGGESTED IN THE WATCHES OF THE NIGHT
 BUT I BID YOUGOODBY FOR THE PRESENT
THEIR EXIT WAS HASTENED BY THEIR SEEING OLD MR
 FEATHERSTONE PULL HISWIG ON EACH SIDE AND SHUT HIS EYES WITH HIS MOUTHWIDENING GRIMACE ASIF HE WERE DETERMINED TO BE DEAF AND BLIND
NONE THE LESS THEY CAME TO STONE COURT DAILY AND SAT BELOW AT THE POSTOF DUTY SOMETIMES CARRYING ON A SLOW DIALOGUE IN AN UNDERTONE IN WHICHTHE OBSERVATION AND RESPONSE WERE SO FAR APART THAT ANY ONE HEARINGTHEM MIGHT HAVE IMAGINED HIMSELF LISTENING TO SPEAKING AUTOMATA INSOME DOUBT WHETHER THE INGENIOUS MECHANISM WOULD REALLY WORK OR WINDITSELF UP FOR A LONG TIME IN ORDER TO STICK AND BE SILENT
 SOLOMON ANDJANE WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY TO BE QUICK WHAT THAT LED TO MIGHT BE SEENON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL IN THE PERSON OF BROTHER JONAH
BUT THEIR WATCH IN THE WAINSCOTED PARLOR WAS SOMETIMES VARIED BY THEPRESENCE OF OTHER GUESTS FROM FAR OR NEAR
 NOW THAT PETER FEATHERSTONEWAS UPSTAIRS HIS PROPERTY COULD BE DISCUSSED WITH ALL THAT LOCALENLIGHTENMENT TO BE FOUND ON THE SPOT SOME RURAL AND MIDDLEMARCHNEIGHBORS EXPRESSED MUCH AGREEMENT WITH THE FAMILY AND SYMPATHY WITHTHEIR INTEREST AGAINST THE VINCYS AND FEMININE VISITORS WERE EVENMOVED TO TEARS IN CONVERSATION WITH MRS
 WAULE WHEN THEY RECALLED THEFACT THAT THEY THEMSELVES HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN TIMES PAST BYCODICILS AND MARRIAGES FOR SPITE ON THE PART OF UNGRATEFUL ELDERLYGENTLEMEN WHO IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED HAD BEEN SPARED FORSOMETHING BETTER
 SUCH CONVERSATION PAUSED SUDDENLY LIKE AN ORGAN WHENTHE BELLOWS ARE LET DROP IF MARY GARTH CAME INTO THE ROOM AND ALLEYES WERE TURNED ON HER AS A POSSIBLE LEGATEE OR ONE WHO MIGHT GETACCESS TO IRON CHESTS
BUT THE YOUNGER MEN WHO WERE RELATIVES OR CONNECTIONS OF THE FAMILYWERE DISPOSED TO ADMIRE HER IN THIS PROBLEMATIC LIGHT AS A GIRL WHOSHOWED MUCH CONDUCT AND WHO AMONG ALL THE CHANCES THAT WERE FLYINGMIGHT TURN OUT TO BE AT LEAST A MODERATE PRIZE
 HENCE SHE HAD HER SHAREOF COMPLIMENTS AND POLITE ATTENTIONS
ESPECIALLY FROM MR
 BORTHROP TRUMBULL A DISTINGUISHED BACHELOR ANDAUCTIONEER OF THOSE PARTS MUCH CONCERNED IN THE SALE OF LAND ANDCATTLE A PUBLIC CHARACTER INDEED WHOSE NAME WAS SEEN ON WIDELYDISTRIBUTED PLACARDS AND WHO MIGHT REASONABLY BE SORRY FOR THOSE WHODID NOT KNOW OF HIM
 HE WAS SECOND COUSIN TO PETER FEATHERSTONE ANDHAD BEEN TREATED BY HIM WITH MORE AMENITY THAN ANY OTHER RELATIVEBEING USEFUL IN MATTERS OF BUSINESS AND IN THAT PROGRAMME OF HISFUNERAL WHICH THE OLD MAN HAD HIMSELF DICTATED HE HAD BEEN NAMED AS ABEARER
 THERE WAS NO ODIOUS CUPIDITY IN MR
 BORTHROP TRUMBULLNOTHINGMORE THAN A SINCERE SENSE OF HIS OWN MERIT WHICH HE WAS AWARE INCASE OF RIVALRY MIGHT TELL AGAINST COMPETITORS SO THAT IF PETERFEATHERSTONE WHO SO FAR AS HE TRUMBULL WAS CONCERNED HAD BEHAVEDLIKE AS GOOD A SOUL AS EVER BREATHED SHOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHINGHANDSOME BY HIM ALL HE COULD SAY WAS THAT HE HAD NEVER FISHED ANDFAWNED BUT HAD ADVISED HIM TO THE BEST OF HIS EXPERIENCE WHICH NOWEXTENDED OVER TWENTY YEARS FROM THE TIME OF HIS APPRENTICESHIP ATFIFTEEN AND WAS LIKELY TO YIELD A KNOWLEDGE OF NO SURREPTITIOUS KIND
HIS ADMIRATION WAS FAR FROM BEING CONFINED TO HIMSELF BUT WASACCUSTOMED PROFESSIONALLY AS WELL AS PRIVATELY TO DELIGHT IN ESTIMATINGTHINGS AT A HIGH RATE
 HE WAS AN AMATEUR OF SUPERIOR PHRASES AND NEVERUSED POOR LANGUAGE WITHOUT IMMEDIATELY CORRECTING HIMSELFWHICH WASFORTUNATE AS HE WAS RATHER LOUD AND GIVEN TO PREDOMINATE STANDING ORWALKING ABOUT FREQUENTLY PULLING DOWN HIS WAISTCOAT WITH THE AIR OF AMAN WHO IS VERY MUCH OF HIS OWN OPINION TRIMMING HIMSELF RAPIDLY WITHHIS FOREFINGER AND MARKING EACH NEW SERIES IN THESE MOVEMENTS BY ABUSY PLAY WITH HIS LARGE SEALS
 THERE WAS OCCASIONALLY A LITTLEFIERCENESS IN HIS DEMEANOR BUT IT WAS DIRECTED CHIEFLY AGAINST FALSEOPINION OF WHICH THERE IS SO MUCH TO CORRECT IN THE WORLD THAT A MANOF SOME READING AND EXPERIENCE NECESSARILY HAS HIS PATIENCE TRIED
 HEFELT THAT THE FEATHERSTONE FAMILY GENERALLY WAS OF LIMITEDUNDERSTANDING BUT BEING A MAN OF THE WORLD AND A PUBLIC CHARACTERTOOK EVERYTHING AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND EVEN WENT TO CONVERSE WITHMR
 JONAH AND YOUNG CRANCH IN THE KITCHEN NOT DOUBTING THAT HE HADIMPRESSED THE LATTER GREATLY BY HIS LEADING QUESTIONS CONCERNING THECHALKY FLATS
 IF ANYBODY HAD OBSERVED THAT MR
 BORTHROP TRUMBULL BEINGAN AUCTIONEER WAS BOUND TO KNOW THE NATURE OF EVERYTHING HE WOULDHAVE SMILED AND TRIMMED HIMSELF SILENTLY WITH THE SENSE THAT HE CAMEPRETTY NEAR THAT
 ON THE WHOLE IN AN AUCTIONEERING WAY HE WAS ANHONORABLE MAN NOT ASHAMED OF HIS BUSINESS AND FEELING THAT THECELEBRATED PEEL NOW SIR ROBERT IF INTRODUCED TO HIM WOULD NOT FAILTO RECOGNIZE HIS IMPORTANCE
I DONT MIND IF I HAVE A SLICE OF THAT HAM AND A GLASS OF THAT ALEMISS GARTH IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME HE SAID COMING INTO THE PARLOR ATHALFPAST ELEVEN AFTER HAVING HAD THE EXCEPTIONAL PRIVILEGE OF SEEINGOLD FEATHERSTONE AND STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE BETWEEN MRS
WAULE AND SOLOMON
ITS NOT NECESSARY FOR YOU TO GO OUTLET ME RING THE BELL
THANK YOU SAID MARY I HAVE AN ERRAND
WELL MR
 TRUMBULL YOURE HIGHLY FAVORED SAID MRS
 WAULE
WHAT
 SEEING THE OLD MAN
 SAID THE AUCTIONEER PLAYING WITH HIS SEALSDISPASSIONATELY
 AH YOU SEE HE HAS RELIED ON ME CONSIDERABLY
 HEREHE PRESSED HIS LIPS TOGETHER AND FROWNED MEDITATIVELY
MIGHT ANYBODY ASK WHAT THEIR BROTHER HAS BEEN SAYING
 SAID SOLOMONIN A SOFT TONE OF HUMILITY IN WHICH HE HAD A SENSE OF LUXURIOUSCUNNING HE BEING A RICH MAN AND NOT IN NEED OF IT
OH YES ANYBODY MAY ASK SAID MR
 TRUMBULL WITH LOUD ANDGOODHUMORED THOUGH CUTTING SARCASM
 ANYBODY MAY INTERROGATE
 ANY ONEMAY GIVE THEIR REMARKS AN INTERROGATIVE TURN HE CONTINUED HISSONOROUSNESS RISING WITH HIS STYLE
 THIS IS CONSTANTLY DONE BY GOODSPEAKERS EVEN WHEN THEY ANTICIPATE NO ANSWER
 IT IS WHAT WE CALL AFIGURE OF SPEECHSPEECH AT A HIGH FIGURE AS ONE MAY SAY
 THE ELOQUENTAUCTIONEER SMILED AT HIS OWN INGENUITY
I SHOULDNT BE SORRY TO HEAR HED REMEMBERED YOU MR
 TRUMBULL SAIDSOLOMON
 I NEVER WAS AGAINST THE DESERVING
 ITS THE UNDESERVING IMAGAINST
AH THERE IT IS YOU SEE THERE IT IS SAID MR
 TRUMBULLSIGNIFICANTLY
 IT CANT BE DENIED THAT UNDESERVING PEOPLE HAVE BEENLEGATEES AND EVEN RESIDUARY LEGATEES
 IT IS SO WITH TESTAMENTARYDISPOSITIONS
 AGAIN HE PURSED UP HIS LIPS AND FROWNED A LITTLE
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY FOR CERTAIN MR
 TRUMBULL THAT MY BROTHER HAS LEFTHIS LAND AWAY FROM OUR FAMILY
 SAID MRS
 WAULE ON WHOM AS ANUNHOPEFUL WOMAN THOSE LONG WORDS HAD A DEPRESSING EFFECT
A MAN MIGHT AS WELL TURN HIS LAND INTO CHARITY LAND AT ONCE AS LEAVEIT TO SOME PEOPLE OBSERVED SOLOMON HIS SISTERS QUESTION HAVINGDRAWN NO ANSWER
WHAT BLUECOAT LAND
 SAID MRS
 WAULE AGAIN
 OH MR
 TRUMBULL YOUNEVER CAN MEAN TO SAY THAT
 IT WOULD BE FLYING IN THE FACE OF THEALMIGHTY THATS PROSPERED HIM
WHILE MRS
 WAULE WAS SPEAKING MR
 BORTHROP TRUMBULL WALKED AWAY FROMTHE FIREPLACE TOWARDS THE WINDOW PATROLLING WITH HIS FOREFINGER ROUNDTHE INSIDE OF HIS STOCK THEN ALONG HIS WHISKERS AND THE CURVES OF HISHAIR
 HE NOW WALKED TO MISS GARTHS WORKTABLE OPENED A BOOK WHICH LAYTHERE AND READ THE TITLE ALOUD WITH POMPOUS EMPHASIS AS IF HE WEREOFFERING IT FOR SALEANNE OF GEIERSTEIN PRONOUNCED JEERSTEEN OR THE MAIDEN OF THEMIST BY THE AUTHOR OF WAVERLEY
 THEN TURNING THE PAGE HE BEGANSONOROUSLYTHE COURSE OF FOUR CENTURIES HAS WELLNIGH ELAPSED SINCETHE SERIES OF EVENTS WHICH ARE RELATED IN THE FOLLOWING CHAPTERS TOOKPLACE ON THE CONTINENT
 HE PRONOUNCED THE LAST TRULY ADMIRABLE WORDWITH THE ACCENT ON THE LAST SYLLABLE NOT AS UNAWARE OF VULGAR USAGEBUT FEELING THAT THIS NOVEL DELIVERY ENHANCED THE SONOROUS BEAUTY WHICHHIS READING HAD GIVEN TO THE WHOLE
AND NOW THE SERVANT CAME IN WITH THE TRAY SO THAT THE MOMENTS FORANSWERING MRS
 WAULES QUESTION HAD GONE BY SAFELY WHILE SHE ANDSOLOMON WATCHING MR
 TRUMBULLS MOVEMENTS WERE THINKING THAT HIGHLEARNING INTERFERED SADLY WITH SERIOUS AFFAIRS
 MR
 BORTHROP TRUMBULLREALLY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT OLD FEATHERSTONES WILL BUT HE COULD HARDLYHAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO DECLARE ANY IGNORANCE UNLESS HE HAD BEEN ARRESTEDFOR MISPRISION OF TREASON
I SHALL TAKE A MERE MOUTHFUL OF HAM AND A GLASS OF ALE HE SAIDREASSURINGLY
 AS A MAN WITH PUBLIC BUSINESS I TAKE A SNACK WHEN ICAN
 I WILL BACK THIS HAM HE ADDED AFTER SWALLOWING SOME MORSELSWITH ALARMING HASTE AGAINST ANY HAM IN THE THREE KINGDOMS
 IN MYOPINION IT IS BETTER THAN THE HAMS AT FRESHITT HALLAND I THINK I AM ATOLERABLE JUDGE
SOME DONT LIKE SO MUCH SUGAR IN THEIR HAMS SAID MRS
 WAULE
 BUT MYPOOR BROTHER WOULD ALWAYS HAVE SUGAR
IF ANY PERSON DEMANDS BETTER HE IS AT LIBERTY TO DO SO BUT GODBLESS ME WHAT AN AROMA
 I SHOULD BE GLAD TO BUY IN THAT QUALITY IKNOW
 THERE IS SOME GRATIFICATION TO A GENTLEMANHERE MR
 TRUMBULLSVOICE CONVEYED AN EMOTIONAL REMONSTRANCEIN HAVING THIS KIND OF HAMSET ON HIS TABLE
HE PUSHED ASIDE HIS PLATE POURED OUT HIS GLASS OF ALE AND DREW HISCHAIR A LITTLE FORWARD PROFITING BY THE OCCASION TO LOOK AT THE INNERSIDE OF HIS LEGS WHICH HE STROKED APPROVINGLYMR
 TRUMBULL HAVING ALLTHOSE LESS FRIVOLOUS AIRS AND GESTURES WHICH DISTINGUISH THEPREDOMINANT RACES OF THE NORTH
YOU HAVE AN INTERESTING WORK THERE I SEE MISS GARTH HE OBSERVEDWHEN MARY REENTERED
 IT IS BY THE AUTHOR OF WAVERLEY THAT IS SIRWALTER SCOTT
 I HAVE BOUGHT ONE OF HIS WORKS MYSELFA VERY NICE THINGA VERY SUPERIOR PUBLICATION ENTITLED IVANHOE
 YOU WILL NOT GET ANYWRITER TO BEAT HIM IN A HURRY I THINKHE WILL NOT IN MY OPINION BESPEEDILY SURPASSED
 I HAVE JUST BEEN READING A PORTION AT THECOMMENCEMENT OF ANNE OF JEERSTEEN
 IT COMMENCES WELL
 THINGS NEVERBEGAN WITH MR
 BORTHROP TRUMBULL THEY ALWAYS COMMENCED BOTH INPRIVATE LIFE AND ON HIS HANDBILLS
 YOU ARE A READER I SEE
 DO YOUSUBSCRIBE TO OUR MIDDLEMARCH LIBRARY
NO SAID MARY
 MR
 FRED VINCY BROUGHT THIS BOOK
I AM A GREAT BOOKMAN MYSELF RETURNED MR
 TRUMBULL
 I HAVE NO LESSTHAN TWO HUNDRED VOLUMES IN CALF AND I FLATTER MYSELF THEY ARE WELLSELECTED
 ALSO PICTURES BY MURILLO RUBENS TENIERS TITIAN VANDYCKAND OTHERS
 I SHALL BE HAPPY TO LEND YOU ANY WORK YOU LIKE TO MENTIONMISS GARTH
I AM MUCH OBLIGED SAID MARY HASTENING AWAY AGAIN BUT I HAVELITTLE TIME FOR READING
I SHOULD SAY MY BROTHER HAS DONE SOMETHING FOR HER IN HIS WILLSAID MR
 SOLOMON IN A VERY LOW UNDERTONE WHEN SHE HAD SHUT THE DOORBEHIND HER POINTING WITH HIS HEAD TOWARDS THE ABSENT MARY
HIS FIRST WIFE WAS A POOR MATCH FOR HIM THOUGH SAID MRS
 WAULE
SHE BROUGHT HIM NOTHING AND THIS YOUNG WOMAN IS ONLY HER NIECEANDVERY PROUD
 AND MY BROTHER HAS ALWAYS PAID HER WAGE
A SENSIBLE GIRL THOUGH IN MY OPINION SAID MR
 TRUMBULL FINISHINGHIS ALE AND STARTING UP WITH AN EMPHATIC ADJUSTMENT OF HIS WAISTCOAT
I HAVE OBSERVED HER WHEN SHE HAS BEEN MIXING MEDICINE IN DROPS
 SHEMINDS WHAT SHE IS DOING SIR
 THAT IS A GREAT POINT IN A WOMAN AND AGREAT POINT FOR OUR FRIEND UPSTAIRS POOR DEAR OLD SOUL
 A MAN WHOSELIFE IS OF ANY VALUE SHOULD THINK OF HIS WIFE AS A NURSE THAT IS WHATI SHOULD DO IF I MARRIED AND I BELIEVE I HAVE LIVED SINGLE LONGENOUGH NOT TO MAKE A MISTAKE IN THAT LINE
 SOME MEN MUST MARRY TOELEVATE THEMSELVES A LITTLE BUT WHEN I AM IN NEED OF THAT I HOPE SOMEONE WILL TELL ME SOI HOPE SOME INDIVIDUAL WILL APPRISE ME OF THE FACT
I WISH YOU GOOD MORNING MRS
 WAULE
 GOOD MORNING MR
 SOLOMON
 I TRUSTWE SHALL MEET UNDER LESS MELANCHOLY AUSPICES
WHEN MR
 TRUMBULL HAD DEPARTED WITH A FINE BOW SOLOMON LEANINGFORWARD OBSERVED TO HIS SISTER YOU MAY DEPEND JANE MY BROTHER HASLEFT THAT GIRL A LUMPING SUM
ANYBODY WOULD THINK SO FROM THE WAY MR
 TRUMBULL TALKS SAID JANE
THEN AFTER A PAUSE HE TALKS AS IF MY DAUGHTERS WASNT TO BE TRUSTEDTO GIVE DROPS
AUCTIONEERS TALK WILD SAID SOLOMON
 NOT BUT WHAT TRUMBULL HAS MADEMONEY
CHAPTER XXXIII
CLOSE UP HIS EYES AND DRAW THE CURTAIN CLOSEAND LET US ALL TO MEDITATION
 HENRY VI
THAT NIGHT AFTER TWELVE OCLOCK MARY GARTH RELIEVED THE WATCH IN MR
FEATHERSTONES ROOM AND SAT THERE ALONE THROUGH THE SMALL HOURS
 SHEOFTEN CHOSE THIS TASK IN WHICH SHE FOUND SOME PLEASURENOTWITHSTANDING THE OLD MANS TESTINESS WHENEVER HE DEMANDED HERATTENTIONS
 THERE WERE INTERVALS IN WHICH SHE COULD SIT PERFECTLYSTILL ENJOYING THE OUTER STILLNESS AND THE SUBDUED LIGHT
 THE RED FIREWITH ITS GENTLY AUDIBLE MOVEMENT SEEMED LIKE A SOLEMN EXISTENCE CALMLYINDEPENDENT OF THE PETTY PASSIONS THE IMBECILE DESIRES THE STRAININGAFTER WORTHLESS UNCERTAINTIES WHICH WERE DAILY MOVING HER CONTEMPT
MARY WAS FOND OF HER OWN THOUGHTS AND COULD AMUSE HERSELF WELL SITTINGIN TWILIGHT WITH HER HANDS IN HER LAP FOR HAVING EARLY HAD STRONGREASON TO BELIEVE THAT THINGS WERE NOT LIKELY TO BE ARRANGED FOR HERPECULIAR SATISFACTION SHE WASTED NO TIME IN ASTONISHMENT AND ANNOYANCEAT THAT FACT
 AND SHE HAD ALREADY COME TO TAKE LIFE VERY MUCH AS ACOMEDY IN WHICH SHE HAD A PROUD NAY A GENEROUS RESOLUTION NOT TO ACTTHE MEAN OR TREACHEROUS PART
 MARY MIGHT HAVE BECOME CYNICAL IF SHE HADNOT HAD PARENTS WHOM SHE HONORED AND A WELL OF AFFECTIONATE GRATITUDEWITHIN HER WHICH WAS ALL THE FULLER BECAUSE SHE HAD LEARNED TO MAKE NOUNREASONABLE CLAIMS
SHE SAT TONIGHT REVOLVING AS SHE WAS WONT THE SCENES OF THE DAY HERLIPS OFTEN CURLING WITH AMUSEMENT AT THE ODDITIES TO WHICH HER FANCYADDED FRESH DROLLERY PEOPLE WERE SO RIDICULOUS WITH THEIR ILLUSIONSCARRYING THEIR FOOLS CAPS UNAWARES THINKING THEIR OWN LIES OPAQUEWHILE EVERYBODY ELSES WERE TRANSPARENT MAKING THEMSELVES EXCEPTIONSTO EVERYTHING AS IF WHEN ALL THE WORLD LOOKED YELLOW UNDER A LAMP THEYALONE WERE ROSY
 YET THERE WERE SOME ILLUSIONS UNDER MARYS EYES WHICHWERE NOT QUITE COMIC TO HER
 SHE WAS SECRETLY CONVINCED THOUGH SHE HADNO OTHER GROUNDS THAN HER CLOSE OBSERVATION OF OLD FEATHERSTONESNATURE THAT IN SPITE OF HIS FONDNESS FOR HAVING THE VINCYS ABOUT HIMTHEY WERE AS LIKELY TO BE DISAPPOINTED AS ANY OF THE RELATIONS WHOM HEKEPT AT A DISTANCE
 SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF DISDAIN FOR MRS
 VINCYSEVIDENT ALARM LEST SHE AND FRED SHOULD BE ALONE TOGETHER BUT IT DIDNOT HINDER HER FROM THINKING ANXIOUSLY OF THE WAY IN WHICH FRED WOULDBE AFFECTED IF IT SHOULD TURN OUT THAT HIS UNCLE HAD LEFT HIM AS POORAS EVER
 SHE COULD MAKE A BUTT OF FRED WHEN HE WAS PRESENT BUT SHE DIDNOT ENJOY HIS FOLLIES WHEN HE WAS ABSENT
YET SHE LIKED HER THOUGHTS A VIGOROUS YOUNG MIND NOT OVERBALANCED BYPASSION FINDS A GOOD IN MAKING ACQUAINTANCE WITH LIFE AND WATCHES ITSOWN POWERS WITH INTEREST
 MARY HAD PLENTY OF MERRIMENT WITHIN
HER THOUGHT WAS NOT VEINED BY ANY SOLEMNITY OR PATHOS ABOUT THE OLD MANON THE BED SUCH SENTIMENTS ARE EASIER TO AFFECT THAN TO FEEL ABOUT ANAGED CREATURE WHOSE LIFE IS NOT VISIBLY ANYTHING BUT A REMNANT OFVICES
 SHE HAD ALWAYS SEEN THE MOST DISAGREEABLE SIDE OF MR
FEATHERSTONE HE WAS NOT PROUD OF HER AND SHE WAS ONLY USEFUL TO HIM
TO BE ANXIOUS ABOUT A SOUL THAT IS ALWAYS SNAPPING AT YOU MUST BE LEFTTO THE SAINTS OF THE EARTH AND MARY WAS NOT ONE OF THEM
 SHE HAD NEVERRETURNED HIM A HARSH WORD AND HAD WAITED ON HIM FAITHFULLY THAT WASHER UTMOST
 OLD FEATHERSTONE HIMSELF WAS NOT IN THE LEAST ANXIOUS ABOUTHIS SOUL AND HAD DECLINED TO SEE MR
 TUCKER ON THE SUBJECT
TONIGHT HE HAD NOT SNAPPED AND FOR THE FIRST HOUR OR TWO HE LAYREMARKABLY STILL UNTIL AT LAST MARY HEARD HIM RATTLING HIS BUNCH OFKEYS AGAINST THE TIN BOX WHICH HE ALWAYS KEPT IN THE BED BESIDE HIM
ABOUT THREE OCLOCK HE SAID WITH REMARKABLE DISTINCTNESS MISSY COMEHERE
MARY OBEYED AND FOUND THAT HE HAD ALREADY DRAWN THE TIN BOX FROM UNDERTHE CLOTHES THOUGH HE USUALLY ASKED TO HAVE THIS DONE FOR HIM AND HEHAD SELECTED THE KEY
 HE NOW UNLOCKED THE BOX AND DRAWING FROM ITANOTHER KEY LOOKED STRAIGHT AT HER WITH EYES THAT SEEMED TO HAVERECOVERED ALL THEIR SHARPNESS AND SAID HOW MANY OF EM ARE IN THEHOUSE
YOU MEAN OF YOUR OWN RELATIONS SIR SAID MARY WELL USED TO THE OLDMANS WAY OF SPEECH
 HE NODDED SLIGHTLY AND SHE WENT ON
MR
 JONAH FEATHERSTONE AND YOUNG CRANCH ARE SLEEPING HERE
OH AY THEY STICK DO THEY
 AND THE RESTTHEY COME EVERY DAY ILLWARRANTSOLOMON AND JANE AND ALL THE YOUNG UNS
 THEY COME PEEPING ANDCOUNTING AND CASTING UP
NOT ALL OF THEM EVERY DAY
 MR
 SOLOMON AND MRS
 WAULE ARE HERE EVERYDAY AND THE OTHERS COME OFTEN
THE OLD MAN LISTENED WITH A GRIMACE WHILE SHE SPOKE AND THEN SAIDRELAXING HIS FACE THE MORE FOOLS THEY
 YOU HEARKEN MISSY
 ITS THREEOCLOCK IN THE MORNING AND IVE GOT ALL MY FACULTIES AS WELL AS EVER IHAD IN MY LIFE
 I KNOW ALL MY PROPERTY AND WHERE THE MONEYS PUT OUTAND EVERYTHING
 AND IVE MADE EVERYTHING READY TO CHANGE MY MIND ANDDO AS I LIKE AT THE LAST
 DO YOU HEAR MISSY
 IVE GOT MY FACULTIES
WELL SIR
 SAID MARY QUIETLY
HE NOW LOWERED HIS TONE WITH AN AIR OF DEEPER CUNNING
 IVE MADE TWOWILLS AND IM GOING TO BURN ONE
 NOW YOU DO AS I TELL YOU
 THIS IS THEKEY OF MY IRON CHEST IN THE CLOSET THERE
 YOU PUSH WELL AT THE SIDE OFTHE BRASS PLATE AT THE TOP TILL IT GOES LIKE A BOLT THEN YOU CAN PUTTHE KEY IN THE FRONT LOCK AND TURN IT
 SEE AND DO THAT AND TAKE OUTTHE TOPMOST PAPERLAST WILL AND TESTAMENTBIG PRINTED
NO SIR SAID MARY IN A FIRM VOICE I CANNOT DO THAT
NOT DO IT
 I TELL YOU YOU MUST SAID THE OLD MAN HIS VOICEBEGINNING TO SHAKE UNDER THE SHOCK OF THIS RESISTANCE
I CANNOT TOUCH YOUR IRON CHEST OR YOUR WILL
 I MUST REFUSE TO DOANYTHING THAT MIGHT LAY ME OPEN TO SUSPICION
I TELL YOU IM IN MY RIGHT MIND
 SHANT I DO AS I LIKE AT THE LAST
 IMADE TWO WILLS ON PURPOSE
 TAKE THE KEY I SAY
NO SIR I WILL NOT SAID MARY MORE RESOLUTELY STILL
 HER REPULSIONWAS GETTING STRONGER
I TELL YOU THERES NO TIME TO LOSE
I CANNOT HELP THAT SIR
 I WILL NOT LET THE CLOSE OF YOUR LIFE SOILTHE BEGINNING OF MINE
 I WILL NOT TOUCH YOUR IRON CHEST OR YOUR WILL
SHE MOVED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE BEDSIDE
THE OLD MAN PAUSED WITH A BLANK STARE FOR A LITTLE WHILE HOLDING THEONE KEY ERECT ON THE RING THEN WITH AN AGITATED JERK HE BEGAN TO WORKWITH HIS BONY LEFT HAND AT EMPTYING THE TIN BOX BEFORE HIM
MISSY HE BEGAN TO SAY HURRIEDLY LOOK HERE
 TAKE THE MONEYTHENOTES AND GOLDLOOK HERETAKE ITYOU SHALL HAVE IT ALLDO AS I TELLYOU
HE MADE AN EFFORT TO STRETCH OUT THE KEY TOWARDS HER AS FAR ASPOSSIBLE AND MARY AGAIN RETREATED
I WILL NOT TOUCH YOUR KEY OR YOUR MONEY SIR
 PRAY DONT ASK ME TO DOIT AGAIN
 IF YOU DO I MUST GO AND CALL YOUR BROTHER
HE LET HIS HAND FALL AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE MARY SAW OLDPETER FEATHERSTONE BEGIN TO CRY CHILDISHLY
 SHE SAID IN AS GENTLE ATONE AS SHE COULD COMMAND PRAY PUT UP YOUR MONEY SIR AND THEN WENTAWAY TO HER SEAT BY THE FIRE HOPING THIS WOULD HELP TO CONVINCE HIMTHAT IT WAS USELESS TO SAY MORE
 PRESENTLY HE RALLIED AND SAID EAGERLYLOOK HERE THEN
 CALL THE YOUNG CHAP
 CALL FRED VINCY
MARYS HEART BEGAN TO BEAT MORE QUICKLY
 VARIOUS IDEAS RUSHED THROUGHHER MIND AS TO WHAT THE BURNING OF A SECOND WILL MIGHT IMPLY
 SHE HADTO MAKE A DIFFICULT DECISION IN A HURRY
I WILL CALL HIM IF YOU WILL LET ME CALL MR
 JONAH AND OTHERS WITHHIM
NOBODY ELSE I SAY
 THE YOUNG CHAP
 I SHALL DO AS I LIKE
WAIT TILL BROAD DAYLIGHT SIR WHEN EVERY ONE IS STIRRING
 OR LET MECALL SIMMONS NOW TO GO AND FETCH THE LAWYER
 HE CAN BE HERE IN LESSTHAN TWO HOURS
LAWYER
 WHAT DO I WANT WITH THE LAWYER
 NOBODY SHALL KNOWI SAYNOBODY SHALL KNOW
 I SHALL DO AS I LIKE
LET ME CALL SOME ONE ELSE SIR SAID MARY PERSUASIVELY
 SHE DID NOTLIKE HER POSITIONALONE WITH THE OLD MAN WHO SEEMED TO SHOW A STRANGEFLARING OF NERVOUS ENERGY WHICH ENABLED HIM TO SPEAK AGAIN AND AGAINWITHOUT FALLING INTO HIS USUAL COUGH YET SHE DESIRED NOT TO PUSHUNNECESSARILY THE CONTRADICTION WHICH AGITATED HIM
 LET ME PRAY CALLSOME ONE ELSE
YOU LET ME ALONE I SAY
 LOOK HERE MISSY
 TAKE THE MONEY
 YOULLNEVER HAVE THE CHANCE AGAIN
 ITS PRETTY NIGH TWO HUNDREDTHERES MOREIN THE BOX AND NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH THERE WAS
 TAKE IT AND DO AS ITELL YOU
MARY STANDING BY THE FIRE SAW ITS RED LIGHT FALLING ON THE OLD MANPROPPED UP ON HIS PILLOWS AND BEDREST WITH HIS BONY HAND HOLDING OUTTHE KEY AND THE MONEY LYING ON THE QUILT BEFORE HIM
 SHE NEVER FORGOTTHAT VISION OF A MAN WANTING TO DO AS HE LIKED AT THE LAST
 BUT THE WAYIN WHICH HE HAD PUT THE OFFER OF THE MONEY URGED HER TO SPEAK WITHHARDER RESOLUTION THAN EVER
IT IS OF NO USE SIR
 I WILL NOT DO IT
 PUT UP YOUR MONEY
 I WILL NOTTOUCH YOUR MONEY
 I WILL DO ANYTHING ELSE I CAN TO COMFORT YOU BUT IWILL NOT TOUCH YOUR KEYS OR YOUR MONEY
ANYTHING ELSEANYTHING ELSE
 SAID OLD FEATHERSTONE WITH HOARSE RAGEWHICH AS IF IN A NIGHTMARE TRIED TO BE LOUD AND YET WAS ONLY JUSTAUDIBLE
 I WANT NOTHING ELSE
 YOU COME HEREYOU COME HERE
MARY APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY KNOWING HIM TOO WELL
 SHE SAW HIMDROPPING HIS KEYS AND TRYING TO GRASP HIS STICK WHILE HE LOOKED AT HERLIKE AN AGED HYENA THE MUSCLES OF HIS FACE GETTING DISTORTED WITH THEEFFORT OF HIS HAND
 SHE PAUSED AT A SAFE DISTANCE
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME CORDIAL SHE SAID QUIETLY AND TRY TO COMPOSEYOURSELF
 YOU WILL PERHAPS GO TO SLEEP
 AND TOMORROW BY DAYLIGHT YOUCAN DO AS YOU LIKE
HE LIFTED THE STICK IN SPITE OF HER BEING BEYOND HIS REACH AND THREWIT WITH A HARD EFFORT WHICH WAS BUT IMPOTENCE
 IT FELL SLIPPING OVERTHE FOOT OF THE BED
 MARY LET IT LIE AND RETREATED TO HER CHAIR BY THEFIRE
 BYANDBY SHE WOULD GO TO HIM WITH THE CORDIAL
 FATIGUE WOULDMAKE HIM PASSIVE
 IT WAS GETTING TOWARDS THE CHILLEST MOMENT OF THEMORNING THE FIRE HAD GOT LOW AND SHE COULD SEE THROUGH THE CHINKBETWEEN THE MOREEN WINDOWCURTAINS THE LIGHT WHITENED BY THE BLIND
HAVING PUT SOME WOOD ON THE FIRE AND THROWN A SHAWL OVER HER SHE SATDOWN HOPING THAT MR
 FEATHERSTONE MIGHT NOW FALL ASLEEP
 IF SHE WENTNEAR HIM THE IRRITATION MIGHT BE KEPT UP
 HE HAD SAID NOTHING AFTERTHROWING THE STICK BUT SHE HAD SEEN HIM TAKING HIS KEYS AGAIN ANDLAYING HIS RIGHT HAND ON THE MONEY
 HE DID NOT PUT IT UP HOWEVER ANDSHE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS DROPPING OFF TO SLEEP
BUT MARY HERSELF BEGAN TO BE MORE AGITATED BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHATSHE HAD GONE THROUGH THAN SHE HAD BEEN BY THE REALITYQUESTIONINGTHOSE ACTS OF HERS WHICH HAD COME IMPERATIVELY AND EXCLUDED ALLQUESTION IN THE CRITICAL MOMENT
PRESENTLY THE DRY WOOD SENT OUT A FLAME WHICH ILLUMINATED EVERYCREVICE AND MARY SAW THAT THE OLD MAN WAS LYING QUIETLY WITH HIS HEADTURNED A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE
 SHE WENT TOWARDS HIM WITH INAUDIBLE STEPSAND THOUGHT THAT HIS FACE LOOKED STRANGELY MOTIONLESS BUT THE NEXTMOMENT THE MOVEMENT OF THE FLAME COMMUNICATING ITSELF TO ALL OBJECTSMADE HER UNCERTAIN
 THE VIOLENT BEATING OF HER HEART RENDERED HERPERCEPTIONS SO DOUBTFUL THAT EVEN WHEN SHE TOUCHED HIM AND LISTENED FORHIS BREATHING SHE COULD NOT TRUST HER CONCLUSIONS
 SHE WENT TO THEWINDOW AND GENTLY PROPPED ASIDE THE CURTAIN AND BLIND SO THAT THESTILL LIGHT OF THE SKY FELL ON THE BED
THE NEXT MOMENT SHE RAN TO THE BELL AND RANG IT ENERGETICALLY
 IN AVERY LITTLE WHILE THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY DOUBT THAT PETER FEATHERSTONEWAS DEAD WITH HIS RIGHT HAND CLASPING THE KEYS AND HIS LEFT HANDLYING ON THE HEAP OF NOTES AND GOLD
BOOK IV
THREE LOVE PROBLEMS
CHAPTER XXXIV
ST GENT
 SUCH MEN AS THIS ARE FEATHERS CHIPS AND STRAWS    CARRY NO WEIGHT NO FORCE
D GENT
 BUT LEVITY    IS CAUSAL TOO AND MAKES THE SUM OF WEIGHT
    FOR POWER FINDS ITS PLACE IN LACK OF POWER    ADVANCE IS CESSION AND THE DRIVEN SHIP    MAY RUN AGROUND BECAUSE THE HELMSMANS THOUGHT    LACKED FORCE TO BALANCE OPPOSITES
IT WAS ON A MORNING OF MAY THAT PETER FEATHERSTONE WAS BURIED
 IN THEPROSAIC NEIGHBORHOOD OF MIDDLEMARCH MAY WAS NOT ALWAYS WARM AND SUNNYAND ON THIS PARTICULAR MORNING A CHILL WIND WAS BLOWING THE BLOSSOMSFROM THE SURROUNDING GARDENS ON TO THE GREEN MOUNDS OF LOWICKCHURCHYARD
 SWIFTLY MOVING CLOUDS ONLY NOW AND THEN ALLOWED A GLEAM TOLIGHT UP ANY OBJECT WHETHER UGLY OR BEAUTIFUL THAT HAPPENED TO STANDWITHIN ITS GOLDEN SHOWER
 IN THE CHURCHYARD THE OBJECTS WERE REMARKABLYVARIOUS FOR THERE WAS A LITTLE COUNTRY CROWD WAITING TO SEE THEFUNERAL
 THE NEWS HAD SPREAD THAT IT WAS TO BE A BIG BURYING THE OLDGENTLEMAN HAD LEFT WRITTEN DIRECTIONS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND MEANT TOHAVE A FUNERAL BEYOND HIS BETTERS
 THIS WAS TRUE FOR OLDFEATHERSTONE HAD NOT BEEN A HARPAGON WHOSE PASSIONS HAD ALL BEENDEVOURED BY THE EVERLEAN AND EVERHUNGRY PASSION OF SAVING AND WHOWOULD DRIVE A BARGAIN WITH HIS UNDERTAKER BEFOREHAND
 HE LOVED MONEYBUT HE ALSO LOVED TO SPEND IT IN GRATIFYING HIS PECULIAR TASTES ANDPERHAPS HE LOVED IT BEST OF ALL AS A MEANS OF MAKING OTHERS FEEL HISPOWER MORE OR LESS UNCOMFORTABLY
 IF ANY ONE WILL HERE CONTEND THATTHERE MUST HAVE BEEN TRAITS OF GOODNESS IN OLD FEATHERSTONE I WILL NOTPRESUME TO DENY THIS BUT I MUST OBSERVE THAT GOODNESS IS OF A MODESTNATURE EASILY DISCOURAGED AND WHEN MUCH PRIVACY ELBOWED IN EARLYLIFE BY UNABASHED VICES IS APT TO RETIRE INTO EXTREME PRIVACY SO THATIT IS MORE EASILY BELIEVED IN BY THOSE WHO CONSTRUCT A SELFISH OLDGENTLEMAN THEORETICALLY THAN BY THOSE WHO FORM THE NARROWER JUDGMENTSBASED ON HIS PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE
 IN ANY CASE HE HAD BEEN BENT ONHAVING A HANDSOME FUNERAL AND ON HAVING PERSONS BID TO IT WHO WOULDRATHER HAVE STAYED AT HOME
 HE HAD EVEN DESIRED THAT FEMALE RELATIVESSHOULD FOLLOW HIM TO THE GRAVE AND POOR SISTER MARTHA HAD TAKEN ADIFFICULT JOURNEY FOR THIS PURPOSE FROM THE CHALKY FLATS
 SHE AND JANEWOULD HAVE BEEN ALTOGETHER CHEERED IN A TEARFUL MANNER BY THIS SIGNTHAT A BROTHER WHO DISLIKED SEEING THEM WHILE HE WAS LIVING HAD BEENPROSPECTIVELY FOND OF THEIR PRESENCE WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE BECOME ATESTATOR IF THE SIGN HAD NOT BEEN MADE EQUIVOCAL BY BEING EXTENDED TOMRS
 VINCY WHOSE EXPENSE IN HANDSOME CRAPE SEEMED TO IMPLY THE MOSTPRESUMPTUOUS HOPES AGGRAVATED BY A BLOOM OF COMPLEXION WHICH TOLDPRETTY PLAINLY THAT SHE WAS NOT A BLOODRELATION BUT OF THAT GENERALLYOBJECTIONABLE CLASS CALLED WIFES KIN
WE ARE ALL OF US IMAGINATIVE IN SOME FORM OR OTHER FOR IMAGES ARE THEBROOD OF DESIRE AND POOR OLD FEATHERSTONE WHO LAUGHED MUCH AT THE WAYIN WHICH OTHERS CAJOLED THEMSELVES DID NOT ESCAPE THE FELLOWSHIP OFILLUSION
 IN WRITING THE PROGRAMME FOR HIS BURIAL HE CERTAINLY DID NOTMAKE CLEAR TO HIMSELF THAT HIS PLEASURE IN THE LITTLE DRAMA OF WHICH ITFORMED A PART WAS CONFINED TO ANTICIPATION
 IN CHUCKLING OVER THEVEXATIONS HE COULD INFLICT BY THE RIGID CLUTCH OF HIS DEAD HAND HEINEVITABLY MINGLED HIS CONSCIOUSNESS WITH THAT LIVID STAGNANT PRESENCEAND SO FAR AS HE WAS PREOCCUPIED WITH A FUTURE LIFE IT WAS WITH ONE OFGRATIFICATION INSIDE HIS COFFIN
 THUS OLD FEATHERSTONE WAS IMAGINATIVEAFTER HIS FASHION
HOWEVER THE THREE MOURNINGCOACHES WERE FILLED ACCORDING TO THEWRITTEN ORDERS OF THE DECEASED
 THERE WERE PALLBEARERS ON HORSEBACKWITH THE RICHEST SCARFS AND HATBANDS AND EVEN THE UNDERBEARERS HADTRAPPINGS OF WOE WHICH WERE OF A GOOD WELLPRICED QUALITY
 THE BLACKPROCESSION WHEN DISMOUNTED LOOKED THE LARGER FOR THE SMALLNESS OF THECHURCHYARD THE HEAVY HUMAN FACES AND THE BLACK DRAPERIES SHIVERING INTHE WIND SEEMED TO TELL OF A WORLD STRANGELY INCONGRUOUS WITH THELIGHTLY DROPPING BLOSSOMS AND THE GLEAMS OF SUNSHINE ON THE DAISIES
THE CLERGYMAN WHO MET THE PROCESSION WAS MR
 CADWALLADERALSO ACCORDINGTO THE REQUEST OF PETER FEATHERSTONE PROMPTED AS USUAL BY PECULIARREASONS
 HAVING A CONTEMPT FOR CURATES WHOM HE ALWAYS CALLEDUNDERSTRAPPERS HE WAS RESOLVED TO BE BURIED BY A BENEFICED CLERGYMAN
MR
 CASAUBON WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOT MERELY BECAUSE HE DECLINEDDUTY OF THIS SORT BUT BECAUSE FEATHERSTONE HAD AN ESPECIAL DISLIKE TOHIM AS THE RECTOR OF HIS OWN PARISH WHO HAD A LIEN ON THE LAND IN THESHAPE OF TITHE ALSO AS THE DELIVERER OF MORNING SERMONS WHICH THE OLDMAN BEING IN HIS PEW AND NOT AT ALL SLEEPY HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO SITTHROUGH WITH AN INWARD SNARL
 HE HAD AN OBJECTION TO A PARSON STUCK UPABOVE HIS HEAD PREACHING TO HIM
 BUT HIS RELATIONS WITH MR
 CADWALLADERHAD BEEN OF A DIFFERENT KIND THE TROUTSTREAM WHICH RAN THROUGH MR
CASAUBONS LAND TOOK ITS COURSE THROUGH FEATHERSTONES ALSO SO THATMR
 CADWALLADER WAS A PARSON WHO HAD HAD TO ASK A FAVOR INSTEAD OFPREACHING
 MOREOVER HE WAS ONE OF THE HIGH GENTRY LIVING FOUR MILESAWAY FROM LOWICK AND WAS THUS EXALTED TO AN EQUAL SKY WITH THE SHERIFFOF THE COUNTY AND OTHER DIGNITIES VAGUELY REGARDED AS NECESSARY TO THESYSTEM OF THINGS
 THERE WOULD BE A SATISFACTION IN BEING BURIED BY MR
CADWALLADER WHOSE VERY NAME OFFERED A FINE OPPORTUNITY FOR PRONOUNCINGWRONGLY IF YOU LIKED
THIS DISTINCTION CONFERRED ON THE RECTOR OF TIPTON AND FRESHITT WAS THEREASON WHY MRS
 CADWALLADER MADE ONE OF THE GROUP THAT WATCHED OLDFEATHERSTONES FUNERAL FROM AN UPPER WINDOW OF THE MANOR
 SHE WAS NOTFOND OF VISITING THAT HOUSE BUT SHE LIKED AS SHE SAID TO SEECOLLECTIONS OF STRANGE ANIMALS SUCH AS THERE WOULD BE AT THIS FUNERALAND SHE HAD PERSUADED SIR JAMES AND THE YOUNG LADY CHETTAM TO DRIVE THERECTOR AND HERSELF TO LOWICK IN ORDER THAT THE VISIT MIGHT BEALTOGETHER PLEASANT
I WILL GO ANYWHERE WITH YOU MRS
 CADWALLADER CELIA HAD SAID BUT IDONT LIKE FUNERALS
OH MY DEAR WHEN YOU HAVE A CLERGYMAN IN YOUR FAMILY YOU MUSTACCOMMODATE YOUR TASTES I DID THAT VERY EARLY
 WHEN I MARRIED HUMPHREYI MADE UP MY MIND TO LIKE SERMONS AND I SET OUT BY LIKING THE END VERYMUCH
 THAT SOON SPREAD TO THE MIDDLE AND THE BEGINNING BECAUSE ICOULDNT HAVE THE END WITHOUT THEM
NO TO BE SURE NOT SAID THE DOWAGER LADY CHETTAM WITH STATELYEMPHASIS
THE UPPER WINDOW FROM WHICH THE FUNERAL COULD BE WELL SEEN WAS IN THEROOM OCCUPIED BY MR
 CASAUBON WHEN HE HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN TO WORK BUTHE HAD RESUMED NEARLY HIS HABITUAL STYLE OF LIFE NOW IN SPITE OFWARNINGS AND PRESCRIPTIONS AND AFTER POLITELY WELCOMING MRS
CADWALLADER HAD SLIPPED AGAIN INTO THE LIBRARY TO CHEW A CUD OF ERUDITEMISTAKE ABOUT CUSH AND MIZRAIM
BUT FOR HER VISITORS DOROTHEA TOO MIGHT HAVE BEEN SHUT UP IN THELIBRARY AND WOULD NOT HAVE WITNESSED THIS SCENE OF OLD FEATHERSTONESFUNERAL WHICH ALOOF AS IT SEEMED TO BE FROM THE TENOR OF HER LIFEALWAYS AFTERWARDS CAME BACK TO HER AT THE TOUCH OF CERTAIN SENSITIVEPOINTS IN MEMORY JUST AS THE VISION OF ST
 PETERS AT ROME WAS INWOVENWITH MOODS OF DESPONDENCY
 SCENES WHICH MAKE VITAL CHANGES IN OURNEIGHBORS LOT ARE BUT THE BACKGROUND OF OUR OWN YET LIKE APARTICULAR ASPECT OF THE FIELDS AND TREES THEY BECOME ASSOCIATED FORUS WITH THE EPOCHS OF OUR OWN HISTORY AND MAKE A PART OF THAT UNITYWHICH LIES IN THE SELECTION OF OUR KEENEST CONSCIOUSNESS
THE DREAMLIKE ASSOCIATION OF SOMETHING ALIEN AND ILLUNDERSTOOD WITHTHE DEEPEST SECRETS OF HER EXPERIENCE SEEMED TO MIRROR THAT SENSE OFLONELINESS WHICH WAS DUE TO THE VERY ARDOR OF DOROTHEAS NATURE
 THECOUNTRY GENTRY OF OLD TIME LIVED IN A RAREFIED SOCIAL AIR DOTTED APARTON THEIR STATIONS UP THE MOUNTAIN THEY LOOKED DOWN WITH IMPERFECTDISCRIMINATION ON THE BELTS OF THICKER LIFE BELOW
 AND DOROTHEA WAS NOTAT EASE IN THE PERSPECTIVE AND CHILLINESS OF THAT HEIGHT
I SHALL NOT LOOK ANY MORE SAID CELIA AFTER THE TRAIN HAD ENTEREDTHE CHURCH PLACING HERSELF A LITTLE BEHIND HER HUSBANDS ELBOW SO THATSHE COULD SLYLY TOUCH HIS COAT WITH HER CHEEK
 I DARE SAY DODO LIKESIT SHE IS FOND OF MELANCHOLY THINGS AND UGLY PEOPLE
I AM FOND OF KNOWING SOMETHING ABOUT THE PEOPLE I LIVE AMONG SAIDDOROTHEA WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING EVERYTHING WITH THE INTEREST OF A MONKON HIS HOLIDAY TOUR
 IT SEEMS TO ME WE KNOW NOTHING OF OUR NEIGHBORSUNLESS THEY ARE COTTAGERS
 ONE IS CONSTANTLY WONDERING WHAT SORT OFLIVES OTHER PEOPLE LEAD AND HOW THEY TAKE THINGS
 I AM QUITE OBLIGEDTO MRS
 CADWALLADER FOR COMING AND CALLING ME OUT OF THE LIBRARY
QUITE RIGHT TO FEEL OBLIGED TO ME SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER

 IT WAS TIME THE OLD MAN DIED AND NONEOF THESE PEOPLE ARE SORRY
HOW PITEOUS
 SAID DOROTHEA
 THIS FUNERAL SEEMS TO ME THE MOST DISMALTHING I EVER SAW
 IT IS A BLOT ON THE MORNING
 I CANNOT BEAR TO THINKTHAT ANY ONE SHOULD DIE AND LEAVE NO LOVE BEHIND
SHE WAS GOING TO SAY MORE BUT SHE SAW HER HUSBAND ENTER AND SEATHIMSELF A LITTLE IN THE BACKGROUND
 THE DIFFERENCE HIS PRESENCE MADE TOHER WAS NOT ALWAYS A HAPPY ONE SHE FELT THAT HE OFTEN INWARDLYOBJECTED TO HER SPEECH
POSITIVELY EXCLAIMED MRS
 CADWALLADER THERE IS A NEW FACE COME OUTFROM BEHIND THAT BROAD MAN QUEERER THAN ANY OF THEM A LITTLE ROUNDHEAD WITH BULGING EYESA SORT OF FROGFACEDO LOOK
 HE MUST BE OFANOTHER BLOOD I THINK
LET ME SEE
 SAID CELIA WITH AWAKENED CURIOSITY STANDING BEHIND MRS
CADWALLADER AND LEANING FORWARD OVER HER HEAD
 OH WHAT AN ODD FACE
THEN WITH A QUICK CHANGE TO ANOTHER SORT OF SURPRISED EXPRESSION SHEADDED WHY DODO YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT MR
 LADISLAW WAS COME AGAIN
DOROTHEA FELT A SHOCK OF ALARM EVERY ONE NOTICED HER SUDDEN PALENESSAS SHE LOOKED UP IMMEDIATELY AT HER UNCLE WHILE MR
 CASAUBON LOOKED ATHER

 HE TALKS UNCOMMONLY WELLPOINTS OUTTHIS THAT AND THE OTHERKNOWS ART AND EVERYTHING OF THATKINDCOMPANIONABLE YOU KNOWIS UP WITH YOU IN ANY TRACKWHAT IVE BEENWANTING A LONG WHILE
MR
 CASAUBON BOWED WITH COLD POLITENESS MASTERING HIS IRRITATION BUTONLY SO FAR AS TO BE SILENT
 HE REMEMBERED WILLS LETTER QUITE AS WELLAS DOROTHEA DID HE HAD NOTICED THAT IT WAS NOT AMONG THE LETTERS WHICHHAD BEEN RESERVED FOR HIM ON HIS RECOVERY AND SECRETLY CONCLUDING THATDOROTHEA HAD SENT WORD TO WILL NOT TO COME TO LOWICK HE HAD SHRUNKWITH PROUD SENSITIVENESS FROM EVER RECURRING TO THE SUBJECT
 HE NOWINFERRED THAT SHE HAD ASKED HER UNCLE TO INVITE WILL TO THE GRANGE ANDSHE FELT IT IMPOSSIBLE AT THAT MOMENT TO ENTER INTO ANY EXPLANATION
MRS
 CADWALLADERS EYES DIVERTED FROM THE CHURCHYARD SAW A GOOD DEALOF DUMB SHOW WHICH WAS NOT SO INTELLIGIBLE TO HER AS SHE COULD HAVEDESIRED AND COULD NOT REPRESS THE QUESTION WHO IS MR
 LADISLAW

WHEN THE ANIMALS ENTERED THE ARK IN PAIRS ONE MAY IMAGINE THAT ALLIEDSPECIES MADE MUCH PRIVATE REMARK ON EACH OTHER AND WERE TEMPTED TOTHINK THAT SO MANY FORMS FEEDING ON THE SAME STORE OF FODDER WEREEMINENTLY SUPERFLUOUS AS TENDING TO DIMINISH THE RATIONS
 I FEAR THEPART PLAYED BY THE VULTURES ON THAT OCCASION WOULD BE TOO PAINFUL FORART TO REPRESENT THOSE BIRDS BEING DISADVANTAGEOUSLY NAKED ABOUT THEGULLET AND APPARENTLY WITHOUT RITES AND CEREMONIES
THE SAME SORT OF TEMPTATION BEFELL THE CHRISTIAN CARNIVORA WHO FORMEDPETER FEATHERSTONES FUNERAL PROCESSION MOST OF THEM HAVING THEIRMINDS BENT ON A LIMITED STORE WHICH EACH WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THEMOST OF
 THE LONGRECOGNIZED BLOODRELATIONS AND CONNECTIONS BYMARRIAGE MADE ALREADY A GOODLY NUMBER WHICH MULTIPLIED BYPOSSIBILITIES PRESENTED A FINE RANGE FOR JEALOUS CONJECTURE ANDPATHETIC HOPEFULNESS
 JEALOUSY OF THE VINCYS HAD CREATED A FELLOWSHIPIN HOSTILITY AMONG ALL PERSONS OF THE FEATHERSTONE BLOOD SO THAT INTHE ABSENCE OF ANY DECIDED INDICATION THAT ONE OF THEMSELVES WAS TOHAVE MORE THAN THE REST THE DREAD LEST THAT LONGLEGGED FRED VINCYSHOULD HAVE THE LAND WAS NECESSARILY DOMINANT THOUGH IT LEFT ABUNDANTFEELING AND LEISURE FOR VAGUER JEALOUSIES SUCH AS WERE ENTERTAINEDTOWARDS MARY GARTH
 SOLOMON FOUND TIME TO REFLECT THAT JONAH WASUNDESERVING AND JONAH TO ABUSE SOLOMON AS GREEDY JANE THE ELDERSISTER HELD THAT MARTHAS CHILDREN OUGHT NOT TO EXPECT SO MUCH AS THEYOUNG WAULES AND MARTHA MORE LAX ON THE SUBJECT OF PRIMOGENITURE WASSORRY TO THINK THAT JANE WAS SO HAVING
 THESE NEAREST OF KIN WERENATURALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE UNREASONABLENESS OF EXPECTATIONS INCOUSINS AND SECOND COUSINS AND USED THEIR ARITHMETIC IN RECKONING THELARGE SUMS THAT SMALL LEGACIES MIGHT MOUNT TO IF THERE WERE TOO MANYOF THEM
 TWO COUSINS WERE PRESENT TO HEAR THE WILL AND A SECOND COUSINBESIDES MR
 TRUMBULL
 THIS SECOND COUSIN WAS A MIDDLEMARCH MERCER OFPOLITE MANNERS AND SUPERFLUOUS ASPIRATES
 THE TWO COUSINS WERE ELDERLYMEN FROM BRASSING ONE OF THEM CONSCIOUS OF CLAIMS ON THE SCORE OFINCONVENIENT EXPENSE SUSTAINED BY HIM IN PRESENTS OF OYSTERS AND OTHEREATABLES TO HIS RICH COUSIN PETER THE OTHER ENTIRELY SATURNINELEANING HIS HANDS AND CHIN ON A STICK AND CONSCIOUS OF CLAIMS BASED ONNO NARROW PERFORMANCE BUT ON MERIT GENERALLY BOTH BLAMELESS CITIZENSOF BRASSING WHO WISHED THAT JONAH FEATHERSTONE DID NOT LIVE THERE
 THEWIT OF A FAMILY IS USUALLY BEST RECEIVED AMONG STRANGERS
WHY TRUMBULL HIMSELF IS PRETTY SURE OF FIVE HUNDREDTHAT YOU MAYDEPENDI SHOULDNT WONDER IF MY BROTHER PROMISED HIM SAID SOLOMONMUSING ALOUD WITH HIS SISTERS THE EVENING BEFORE THE FUNERAL
DEAR DEAR
 SAID POOR SISTER MARTHA WHOSE IMAGINATION OF HUNDREDSHAD BEEN HABITUALLY NARROWED TO THE AMOUNT OF HER UNPAID RENT
BUT IN THE MORNING ALL THE ORDINARY CURRENTS OF CONJECTURE WEREDISTURBED BY THE PRESENCE OF A STRANGE MOURNER WHO HAD PLASHED AMONGTHEM AS IF FROM THE MOON
 THIS WAS THE STRANGER DESCRIBED BY MRS
CADWALLADER AS FROGFACED A MAN PERHAPS ABOUT TWO OR THREE AND THIRTYWHOSE PROMINENT EYES THINLIPPED DOWNWARDCURVED MOUTH AND HAIRSLEEKLY BRUSHED AWAY FROM A FOREHEAD THAT SANK SUDDENLY ABOVE THE RIDGEOF THE EYEBROWS CERTAINLY GAVE HIS FACE A BATRACHIAN UNCHANGEABLENESSOF EXPRESSION
 HERE CLEARLY WAS A NEW LEGATEE ELSE WHY WAS HE BIDDENAS A MOURNER
 HERE WERE NEW POSSIBILITIES RAISING A NEW UNCERTAINTYWHICH ALMOST CHECKED REMARK IN THE MOURNINGCOACHES
 WE ARE ALLHUMILIATED BY THE SUDDEN DISCOVERY OF A FACT WHICH HAS EXISTED VERYCOMFORTABLY AND PERHAPS BEEN STARING AT US IN PRIVATE WHILE WE HAVEBEEN MAKING UP OUR WORLD ENTIRELY WITHOUT IT
 NO ONE HAD SEEN THISQUESTIONABLE STRANGER BEFORE EXCEPT MARY GARTH AND SHE KNEW NOTHINGMORE OF HIM THAN THAT HE HAD TWICE BEEN TO STONE COURT WHEN MR
FEATHERSTONE WAS DOWNSTAIRS AND HAD SAT ALONE WITH HIM FOR SEVERALHOURS
 SHE HAD FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY OF MENTIONING THIS TO HER FATHERAND PERHAPS CALEBS WERE THE ONLY EYES EXCEPT THE LAWYERS WHICHEXAMINED THE STRANGER WITH MORE OF INQUIRY THAN OF DISGUST ORSUSPICION
 CALEB GARTH HAVING LITTLE EXPECTATION AND LESS CUPIDITYWAS INTERESTED IN THE VERIFICATION OF HIS OWN GUESSES AND THE CALMNESSWITH WHICH HE HALF SMILINGLY RUBBED HIS CHIN AND SHOT INTELLIGENTGLANCES MUCH AS IF HE WERE VALUING A TREE MADE A FINE CONTRAST WITHTHE ALARM OR SCORN VISIBLE IN OTHER FACES WHEN THE UNKNOWN MOURNERWHOSE NAME WAS UNDERSTOOD TO BE RIGG ENTERED THE WAINSCOTED PARLOR ANDTOOK HIS SEAT NEAR THE DOOR TO MAKE PART OF THE AUDIENCE WHEN THE WILLSHOULD BE READ
 JUST THEN MR
 SOLOMON AND MR
 JONAH WERE GONE UPSTAIRSWITH THE LAWYER TO SEARCH FOR THE WILL AND MRS
 WAULE SEEING TWOVACANT SEATS BETWEEN HERSELF AND MR
 BORTHROP TRUMBULL HAD THE SPIRITTO MOVE NEXT TO THAT GREAT AUTHORITY WHO WAS HANDLING HIS WATCHSEALSAND TRIMMING HIS OUTLINES WITH A DETERMINATION NOT TO SHOW ANYTHING SOCOMPROMISING TO A MAN OF ABILITY AS WONDER OR SURPRISE
I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT MY POOR BROTHERS DONE MR
TRUMBULL SAID MRS
 WAULE IN THE LOWEST OF HER WOOLLY TONES WHILESHE TURNED HER CRAPESHADOWED BONNET TOWARDS MR
 TRUMBULLS EAR
MY GOOD LADY WHATEVER WAS TOLD ME WAS TOLD IN CONFIDENCE SAID THEAUCTIONEER PUTTING HIS HAND UP TO SCREEN THAT SECRET
THEM WHOVE MADE SURE OF THEIR GOODLUCK MAY BE DISAPPOINTED YETMRS
 WAULE CONTINUED FINDING SOME RELIEF IN THIS COMMUNICATION
HOPES ARE OFTEN DELUSIVE SAID MR
 TRUMBULL STILL IN CONFIDENCE
AH
 SAID MRS
 WAULE LOOKING ACROSS AT THE VINCYS AND THEN MOVINGBACK TO THE SIDE OF HER SISTER MARTHA
ITS WONDERFUL HOW CLOSE POOR PETER WAS SHE SAID IN THE SAMEUNDERTONES
 WE NONE OF US KNOW WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE HAD ON HIS MIND
 IONLY HOPE AND TRUST HE WASNT A WORSE LIVER THAN WE THINK OF MARTHA
POOR MRS
 CRANCH WAS BULKY AND BREATHING ASTHMATICALLY HAD THEADDITIONAL MOTIVE FOR MAKING HER REMARKS UNEXCEPTIONABLE AND GIVINGTHEM A GENERAL BEARING THAT EVEN HER WHISPERS WERE LOUD AND LIABLE TOSUDDEN BURSTS LIKE THOSE OF A DERANGED BARRELORGAN
I NEVER WAS COVETOUS JANE SHE REPLIED BUT I HAVE SIX CHILDRENAND HAVE BURIED THREE AND I DIDNT MARRY INTO MONEY
 THE ELDEST THATSITS THERE IS BUT NINETEENSO I LEAVE YOU TO GUESS
 AND STOCK ALWAYSSHORT AND LAND MOST AWKWARD
 BUT IF EVER IVE BEGGED AND PRAYED ITSBEEN TO GOD ABOVE THOUGH WHERE THERES ONE BROTHER A BACHELOR AND THEOTHER CHILDLESS AFTER TWICE MARRYINGANYBODY MIGHT THINK
MEANWHILE MR
 VINCY HAD GLANCED AT THE PASSIVE FACE OF MR
 RIGG ANDHAD TAKEN OUT HIS SNUFFBOX AND TAPPED IT BUT HAD PUT IT AGAINUNOPENED AS AN INDULGENCE WHICH HOWEVER CLARIFYING TO THE JUDGMENTWAS UNSUITED TO THE OCCASION
 I SHOULDNT WONDER IF FEATHERSTONE HADBETTER FEELINGS THAN ANY OF US GAVE HIM CREDIT FOR HE OBSERVED INTHE EAR OF HIS WIFE
 THIS FUNERAL SHOWS A THOUGHT ABOUT EVERYBODY ITLOOKS WELL WHEN A MAN WANTS TO BE FOLLOWED BY HIS FRIENDS AND IF THEYARE HUMBLE NOT TO BE ASHAMED OF THEM
 I SHOULD BE ALL THE BETTERPLEASED IF HED LEFT LOTS OF SMALL LEGACIES
 THEY MAY BE UNCOMMONLYUSEFUL TO FELLOWS IN A SMALL WAY
EVERYTHING IS AS HANDSOME AS COULD BE CRAPE AND SILK AND EVERYTHINGSAID MRS
 VINCY CONTENTEDLY
BUT I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT FRED WAS UNDER SOME DIFFICULTY IN REPRESSINGA LAUGH WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE UNSUITABLE THAN HIS FATHERSSNUFFBOX
 FRED HAD OVERHEARD MR
 JONAH SUGGESTING SOMETHING ABOUT ALOVECHILD AND WITH THIS THOUGHT IN HIS MIND THE STRANGERS FACEWHICH HAPPENED TO BE OPPOSITE HIM AFFECTED HIM TOO LUDICROUSLY
 MARYGARTH DISCERNING HIS DISTRESS IN THE TWITCHINGS OF HIS MOUTH AND HISRECOURSE TO A COUGH CAME CLEVERLY TO HIS RESCUE BY ASKING HIM TOCHANGE SEATS WITH HER SO THAT HE GOT INTO A SHADOWY CORNER
 FRED WASFEELING AS GOODNATUREDLY AS POSSIBLE TOWARDS EVERYBODY INCLUDINGRIGG AND HAVING SOME RELENTING TOWARDS ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO WERE LESSLUCKY THAN HE WAS AWARE OF BEING HIMSELF HE WOULD NOT FOR THE WORLDHAVE BEHAVED AMISS STILL IT WAS PARTICULARLY EASY TO LAUGH
BUT THE ENTRANCE OF THE LAWYER AND THE TWO BROTHERS DREW EVERY ONESATTENTION
 THE LAWYER WAS MR
 STANDISH AND HE HAD COME TO STONE COURTTHIS MORNING BELIEVING THAT HE KNEW THOROUGHLY WELL WHO WOULD BEPLEASED AND WHO DISAPPOINTED BEFORE THE DAY WAS OVER
 THE WILL HEEXPECTED TO READ WAS THE LAST OF THREE WHICH HE HAD DRAWN UP FOR MR
FEATHERSTONE
 MR
 STANDISH WAS NOT A MAN WHO VARIED HIS MANNERS HEBEHAVED WITH THE SAME DEEPVOICED OFFHAND CIVILITY TO EVERYBODY ASIF HE SAW NO DIFFERENCE IN THEM AND TALKED CHIEFLY OF THE HAYCROPWHICH WOULD BE VERY FINE BY GOD
 OF THE LAST BULLETINS CONCERNINGTHE KING AND OF THE DUKE OF CLARENCE WHO WAS A SAILOR EVERY INCH OFHIM AND JUST THE MAN TO RULE OVER AN ISLAND LIKE BRITAIN
OLD FEATHERSTONE HAD OFTEN REFLECTED AS HE SAT LOOKING AT THE FIRE THATSTANDISH WOULD BE SURPRISED SOME DAY IT IS TRUE THAT IF HE HAD DONE ASHE LIKED AT THE LAST AND BURNT THE WILL DRAWN UP BY ANOTHER LAWYER HEWOULD NOT HAVE SECURED THAT MINOR END STILL HE HAD HAD HIS PLEASURE INRUMINATING ON IT
 AND CERTAINLY MR
 STANDISH WAS SURPRISED BUT NOT ATALL SORRY ON THE CONTRARY HE RATHER ENJOYED THE ZEST OF A LITTLECURIOSITY IN HIS OWN MIND WHICH THE DISCOVERY OF A SECOND WILL ADDEDTO THE PROSPECTIVE AMAZEMENT ON THE PART OF THE FEATHERSTONE FAMILY
AS TO THE SENTIMENTS OF SOLOMON AND JONAH THEY WERE HELD IN UTTERSUSPENSE IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT THE OLD WILL WOULD HAVE A CERTAINVALIDITY AND THAT THERE MIGHT BE SUCH AN INTERLACEMENT OF POOR PETERSFORMER AND LATTER INTENTIONS AS TO CREATE ENDLESS LAWING BEFOREANYBODY CAME BY THEIR OWNAN INCONVENIENCE WHICH WOULD HAVE AT LEASTTHE ADVANTAGE OF GOING ALL ROUND
 HENCE THE BROTHERS SHOWED ATHOROUGHLY NEUTRAL GRAVITY AS THEY REENTERED WITH MR
 STANDISH BUTSOLOMON TOOK OUT HIS WHITE HANDKERCHIEF AGAIN WITH A SENSE THAT IN ANYCASE THERE WOULD BE AFFECTING PASSAGES AND CRYING AT FUNERALS HOWEVERDRY WAS CUSTOMARILY SERVED UP IN LAWN
PERHAPS THE PERSON WHO FELT THE MOST THROBBING EXCITEMENT AT THISMOMENT WAS MARY GARTH IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IT WAS SHE WHO HADVIRTUALLY DETERMINED THE PRODUCTION OF THIS SECOND WILL WHICH MIGHTHAVE MOMENTOUS EFFECTS ON THE LOT OF SOME PERSONS PRESENT
 NO SOULEXCEPT HERSELF KNEW WHAT HAD PASSED ON THAT FINAL NIGHT
THE WILL I HOLD IN MY HAND SAID MR
 STANDISH WHO SEATED AT THETABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM TOOK HIS TIME ABOUT EVERYTHINGINCLUDING THE COUGHS WITH WHICH HE SHOWED A DISPOSITION TO CLEAR HISVOICE WAS DRAWN UP BY MYSELF AND EXECUTED BY OUR DECEASED FRIEND ONTHE TH OF AUGUST 
 BUT I FIND THAT THERE IS A SUBSEQUENTINSTRUMENT HITHERTO UNKNOWN TO ME BEARING DATE THE TH OF JULY HARDLY A YEAR LATER THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE
 AND THERE IS FARTHER ISEEMR
 STANDISH WAS CAUTIOUSLY TRAVELLING OVER THE DOCUMENT WITH HISSPECTACLESA CODICIL TO THIS LATTER WILL BEARING DATE MARCH  
DEAR DEAR
 SAID SISTER MARTHA NOT MEANING TO BE AUDIBLE BUT DRIVENTO SOME ARTICULATION UNDER THIS PRESSURE OF DATES
I SHALL BEGIN BY READING THE EARLIER WILL CONTINUED MR
 STANDISHSINCE SUCH AS APPEARS BY HIS NOT HAVING DESTROYED THE DOCUMENT WASTHE INTENTION OF THE DECEASED
THE PREAMBLE WAS FELT TO BE RATHER LONG AND SEVERAL BESIDES SOLOMONSHOOK THEIR HEADS PATHETICALLY LOOKING ON THE GROUND ALL EYES AVOIDEDMEETING OTHER EYES AND WERE CHIEFLY FIXED EITHER ON THE SPOTS IN THETABLECLOTH OR ON MR
 STANDISHS BALD HEAD EXCEPTING MARY GARTHS
WHEN ALL THE REST WERE TRYING TO LOOK NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR IT WASSAFE FOR HER TO LOOK AT THEM
 AND AT THE SOUND OF THE FIRST GIVE ANDBEQUEATH SHE COULD SEE ALL COMPLEXIONS CHANGING SUBTLY AS IF SOMEFAINT VIBRATION WERE PASSING THROUGH THEM SAVE THAT OF MR
 RIGG
 HESAT IN UNALTERED CALM AND IN FACT THE COMPANY PREOCCUPIED WITH MOREIMPORTANT PROBLEMS AND WITH THE COMPLICATION OF LISTENING TO BEQUESTSWHICH MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE REVOKED HAD CEASED TO THINK OF HIM
 FREDBLUSHED AND MR
 VINCY FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DO WITHOUT HIS SNUFFBOXIN HIS HAND THOUGH HE KEPT IT CLOSED
THE SMALL BEQUESTS CAME FIRST AND EVEN THE RECOLLECTION THAT THERE WASANOTHER WILL AND THAT POOR PETER MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT BETTER OF IT COULDNOT QUELL THE RISING DISGUST AND INDIGNATION
 ONE LIKES TO BE DONE WELLBY IN EVERY TENSE PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE
 AND HERE WAS PETERCAPABLE FIVE YEARS AGO OF LEAVING ONLY TWO HUNDRED APIECE TO HIS OWNBROTHERS AND SISTERS AND ONLY A HUNDRED APIECE TO HIS OWN NEPHEWS ANDNIECES THE GARTHS WERE NOT MENTIONED BUT MRS
 VINCY AND ROSAMOND WEREEACH TO HAVE A HUNDRED
 MR
 TRUMBULL WAS TO HAVE THE GOLDHEADED CANEAND FIFTY POUNDS THE OTHER SECOND COUSINS AND THE COUSINS PRESENT WEREEACH TO HAVE THE LIKE HANDSOME SUM WHICH AS THE SATURNINE COUSINOBSERVED WAS A SORT OF LEGACY THAT LEFT A MAN NOWHERE AND THERE WASMUCH MORE OF SUCH OFFENSIVE DRIBBLING IN FAVOR OF PERSONS NOTPRESENTPROBLEMATICAL AND IT WAS TO BE FEARED LOW CONNECTIONS
ALTOGETHER RECKONING HASTILY HERE WERE ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DISPOSEDOF
 WHERE THEN HAD PETER MEANT THE REST OF THE MONEY TO GOAND WHERETHE LAND
 AND WHAT WAS REVOKED AND WHAT NOT REVOKEDAND WAS THEREVOCATION FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE
 ALL EMOTION MUST BE CONDITIONALAND MIGHT TURN OUT TO BE THE WRONG THING
 THE MEN WERE STRONG ENOUGH TOBEAR UP AND KEEP QUIET UNDER THIS CONFUSED SUSPENSE SOME LETTING THEIRLOWER LIP FALL OTHERS PURSING IT UP ACCORDING TO THE HABIT OF THEIRMUSCLES
 BUT JANE AND MARTHA SANK UNDER THE RUSH OF QUESTIONS ANDBEGAN TO CRY POOR MRS
 CRANCH BEING HALF MOVED WITH THE CONSOLATION OFGETTING ANY HUNDREDS AT ALL WITHOUT WORKING FOR THEM AND HALF AWARETHAT HER SHARE WAS SCANTY WHEREAS MRS
 WAULES MIND WAS ENTIRELYFLOODED WITH THE SENSE OF BEING AN OWN SISTER AND GETTING LITTLE WHILESOMEBODY ELSE WAS TO HAVE MUCH
 THE GENERAL EXPECTATION NOW WAS THATTHE MUCH WOULD FALL TO FRED VINCY BUT THE VINCYS THEMSELVES WERESURPRISED WHEN TEN THOUSAND POUNDS IN SPECIFIED INVESTMENTS WEREDECLARED TO BE BEQUEATHED TO HIMWAS THE LAND COMING TOO
 FRED BIT HISLIPS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO HELP SMILING AND MRS
 VINCY FELT HERSELF THEHAPPIEST OF WOMENPOSSIBLE REVOCATION SHRINKING OUT OF SIGHT IN THISDAZZLING VISION
THERE WAS STILL A RESIDUE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY AS WELL AS THE LAND BUTTHE WHOLE WAS LEFT TO ONE PERSON AND THAT PERSON WASO POSSIBILITIES
O EXPECTATIONS FOUNDED ON THE FAVOR OF CLOSE OLD GENTLEMEN
 O ENDLESSVOCATIVES THAT WOULD STILL LEAVE EXPRESSION SLIPPING HELPLESS FROM THEMEASUREMENT OF MORTAL FOLLY
THAT RESIDUARY LEGATEE WAS JOSHUA RIGGWHO WAS ALSO SOLE EXECUTOR AND WHO WAS TO TAKE THENCEFORTH THE NAME OFFEATHERSTONE
THERE WAS A RUSTLING WHICH SEEMED LIKE A SHUDDER RUNNING ROUND THEROOM
 EVERY ONE STARED AFRESH AT MR
 RIGG WHO APPARENTLY EXPERIENCEDNO SURPRISE
A MOST SINGULAR TESTAMENTARY DISPOSITION
 EXCLAIMED MR
 TRUMBULLPREFERRING FOR ONCE THAT HE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IGNORANT IN THE PAST
BUT THERE IS A SECOND WILLTHERE IS A FURTHER DOCUMENT
 WE HAVE NOTYET HEARD THE FINAL WISHES OF THE DECEASED
MARY GARTH WAS FEELING THAT WHAT THEY HAD YET TO HEAR WERE NOT THEFINAL WISHES
 THE SECOND WILL REVOKED EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE LEGACIES TOTHE LOW PERSONS BEFORE MENTIONED SOME ALTERATIONS IN THESE BEING THEOCCASION OF THE CODICIL AND THE BEQUEST OF ALL THE LAND LYING INLOWICK PARISH WITH ALL THE STOCK AND HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE TO JOSHUARIGG
 THE RESIDUE OF THE PROPERTY WAS TO BE DEVOTED TO THE ERECTION ANDENDOWMENT OF ALMSHOUSES FOR OLD MEN TO BE CALLED FEATHERSTONESALMSHOUSES AND TO BE BUILT ON A PIECE OF LAND NEAR MIDDLEMARCHALREADY BOUGHT FOR THE PURPOSE BY THE TESTATOR HE WISHINGSO THEDOCUMENT DECLAREDTO PLEASE GOD ALMIGHTY
 NOBODY PRESENT HAD AFARTHING BUT MR
 TRUMBULL HAD THE GOLDHEADED CANE
 IT TOOK SOME TIMEFOR THE COMPANY TO RECOVER THE POWER OF EXPRESSION
 MARY DARED NOT LOOKAT FRED
MR
 VINCY WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAKAFTER USING HIS SNUFFBOXENERGETICALLYAND HE SPOKE WITH LOUD INDIGNATION
 THE MOSTUNACCOUNTABLE WILL I EVER HEARD
 I SHOULD SAY HE WAS NOT IN HIS RIGHTMIND WHEN HE MADE IT
 I SHOULD SAY THIS LAST WILL WAS VOID ADDED MR
VINCY FEELING THAT THIS EXPRESSION PUT THE THING IN THE TRUE LIGHT
EH STANDISH
OUR DECEASED FRIEND ALWAYS KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT I THINK SAID MR
STANDISH
 EVERYTHING IS QUITE REGULAR
 HERE IS A LETTER FROM CLEMMENSOF BRASSING TIED WITH THE WILL
 HE DREW IT UP
 A VERY RESPECTABLESOLICITOR
I NEVER NOTICED ANY ALIENATION OF MINDANY ABERRATION OF INTELLECT INTHE LATE MR
 FEATHERSTONE SAID BORTHROP TRUMBULL BUT I CALL THISWILL ECCENTRIC
 I WAS ALWAYS WILLINGLY OF SERVICE TO THE OLD SOUL ANDHE INTIMATED PRETTY PLAINLY A SENSE OF OBLIGATION WHICH WOULD SHOWITSELF IN HIS WILL
 THE GOLDHEADED CANE IS FARCICAL CONSIDERED AS ANACKNOWLEDGMENT TO ME BUT HAPPILY I AM ABOVE MERCENARY CONSIDERATIONS
THERES NOTHING VERY SURPRISING IN THE MATTER THAT I CAN SEE SAIDCALEB GARTH
 ANYBODY MIGHT HAVE HAD MORE REASON FOR WONDERING IF THEWILL HAD BEEN WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT FROM AN OPENMINDED STRAIGHTFORWARDMAN
 FOR MY PART I WISH THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS A WILL
THATS A STRANGE SENTIMENT TO COME FROM A CHRISTIAN MAN BY GOD
 SAIDTHE LAWYER
 I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW YOU WILL BACK THAT UP GARTH
OH SAID CALEB LEANING FORWARD ADJUSTING HIS FINGERTIPS WITHNICETY AND LOOKING MEDITATIVELY ON THE GROUND
 IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO HIMTHAT WORDS WERE THE HARDEST PART OF BUSINESS
BUT HERE MR
 JONAH FEATHERSTONE MADE HIMSELF HEARD
 WELL HE ALWAYSWAS A FINE HYPOCRITE WAS MY BROTHER PETER
 BUT THIS WILL CUTS OUTEVERYTHING
 IF ID KNOWN A WAGON AND SIX HORSES SHOULDNT HAVE DRAWNME FROM BRASSING
 ILL PUT A WHITE HAT AND DRAB COAT ON TOMORROW
DEAR DEAR WEPT MRS
 CRANCH AND WEVE BEEN AT THE EXPENSE OFTRAVELLING AND THAT POOR LAD SITTING IDLE HERE SO LONG
 ITS THE FIRSTTIME I EVER HEARD MY BROTHER PETER WAS SO WISHFUL TO PLEASE GODALMIGHTY BUT IF I WAS TO BE STRUCK HELPLESS I MUST SAY ITS HARDI CANTHINK NO OTHER
ITLL DO HIM NO GOOD WHERE HES GONE THATS MY BELIEF SAID SOLOMONWITH A BITTERNESS WHICH WAS REMARKABLY GENUINE THOUGH HIS TONE COULDNOT HELP BEING SLY
 PETER WAS A BAD LIVER AND ALMSHOUSES WONT COVERIT WHEN HES HAD THE IMPUDENCE TO SHOW IT AT THE LAST
AND ALL THE WHILE HAD GOT HIS OWN LAWFUL FAMILYBROTHERS AND SISTERSAND NEPHEWS AND NIECESAND HAS SAT IN CHURCH WITH EM WHENEVER HETHOUGHT WELL TO COME SAID MRS
 WAULE
 AND MIGHT HAVE LEFT HISPROPERTY SO RESPECTABLE TO THEM THATS NEVER BEEN USED TO EXTRAVAGANCEOR UNSTEADINESS IN NO MANNER OF WAYAND NOT SO POOR BUT WHAT THEY COULDHAVE SAVED EVERY PENNY AND MADE MORE OF IT
 AND METHE TROUBLE IVEBEEN AT TIMES AND TIMES TO COME HERE AND BE SISTERLYAND HIM WITHTHINGS ON HIS MIND ALL THE WHILE THAT MIGHT MAKE ANYBODYS FLESH CREEP
BUT IF THE ALMIGHTYS ALLOWED IT HE MEANS TO PUNISH HIM FOR IT
BROTHER SOLOMON I SHALL BE GOING IF YOULL DRIVE ME
IVE NO DESIRE TO PUT MY FOOT ON THE PREMISES AGAIN SAID SOLOMON
IVE GOT LAND OF MY OWN AND PROPERTY OF MY OWN TO WILL AWAY
ITS A POOR TALE HOW LUCK GOES IN THE WORLD SAID JONAH
 IT NEVERANSWERS TO HAVE A BIT OF SPIRIT IN YOU
 YOUD BETTER BE A DOG IN THEMANGER
 BUT THOSE ABOVE GROUND MIGHT LEARN A LESSON
 ONE FOOLS WILL ISENOUGH IN A FAMILY
THERES MORE WAYS THAN ONE OF BEING A FOOL SAID SOLOMON
 I SHANTLEAVE MY MONEY TO BE POURED DOWN THE SINK AND I SHANT LEAVE IT TOFOUNDLINGS FROM AFRICAY
 I LIKE FEATHERSTONES THAT WERE BREWED SUCHAND NOT TURNED FEATHERSTONES WITH STICKING THE NAME ON EM
SOLOMON ADDRESSED THESE REMARKS IN A LOUD ASIDE TO MRS
 WAULE AS HEROSE TO ACCOMPANY HER
 BROTHER JONAH FELT HIMSELF CAPABLE OF MUCH MORESTINGING WIT THAN THIS BUT HE REFLECTED THAT THERE WAS NO USE INOFFENDING THE NEW PROPRIETOR OF STONE COURT UNTIL YOU WERE CERTAINTHAT HE WAS QUITE WITHOUT INTENTIONS OF HOSPITALITY TOWARDS WITTY MENWHOSE NAME HE WAS ABOUT TO BEAR
MR
 JOSHUA RIGG IN FACT APPEARED TO TROUBLE HIMSELF LITTLE ABOUT ANYINNUENDOES BUT SHOWED A NOTABLE CHANGE OF MANNER WALKING COOLLY UP TOMR
 STANDISH AND PUTTING BUSINESS QUESTIONS WITH MUCH COOLNESS
 HE HADA HIGH CHIRPING VOICE AND A VILE ACCENT
 FRED WHOM HE NO LONGER MOVEDTO LAUGHTER THOUGHT HIM THE LOWEST MONSTER HE HAD EVER SEEN
 BUT FREDWAS FEELING RATHER SICK
 THE MIDDLEMARCH MERCER WAITED FOR ANOPPORTUNITY OF ENGAGING MR
 RIGG IN CONVERSATION THERE WAS NO KNOWINGHOW MANY PAIRS OF LEGS THE NEW PROPRIETOR MIGHT REQUIRE HOSE FOR ANDPROFITS WERE MORE TO BE RELIED ON THAN LEGACIES
 ALSO THE MERCER AS ASECOND COUSIN WAS DISPASSIONATE ENOUGH TO FEEL CURIOSITY
MR
 VINCY AFTER HIS ONE OUTBURST HAD REMAINED PROUDLY SILENT THOUGHTOO MUCH PREOCCUPIED WITH UNPLEASANT FEELINGS TO THINK OF MOVING TILLHE OBSERVED THAT HIS WIFE HAD GONE TO FREDS SIDE AND WAS CRYINGSILENTLY WHILE SHE HELD HER DARLINGS HAND
 HE ROSE IMMEDIATELY ANDTURNING HIS BACK ON THE COMPANY WHILE HE SAID TO HER IN ANUNDERTONEDONT GIVE WAY LUCY DONT MAKE A FOOL OF YOURSELF MYDEAR BEFORE THESE PEOPLE HE ADDED IN HIS USUAL LOUD VOICEGO ANDORDER THE PHAETON FRED I HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE
MARY GARTH HAD BEFORE THIS BEEN GETTING READY TO GO HOME WITH HERFATHER
 SHE MET FRED IN THE HALL AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME HAD THECOURAGE TO LOOK AT HIM
 HE HAD THAT WITHERED SORT OF PALENESS WHICHWILL SOMETIMES COME ON YOUNG FACES AND HIS HAND WAS VERY COLD WHEN SHESHOOK IT
 MARY TOO WAS AGITATED SHE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT FATALLYWITHOUT WILL OF HER OWN SHE HAD PERHAPS MADE A GREAT DIFFERENCE TOFREDS LOT
GOODBY SHE SAID WITH AFFECTIONATE SADNESS
 BE BRAVE FRED
 I DOBELIEVE YOU ARE BETTER WITHOUT THE MONEY
 WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF IT TOMR
 FEATHERSTONE
THATS ALL VERY FINE SAID FRED PETTISHLY
 WHAT IS A FELLOW TO DO
I MUST GO INTO THE CHURCH NOW
 HE KNEW THAT THIS WOULD VEX MARY VERYWELL THEN SHE MUST TELL HIM WHAT ELSE HE COULD DO
 AND I THOUGHT ISHOULD BE ABLE TO PAY YOUR FATHER AT ONCE AND MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT
AND YOU HAVE NOT EVEN A HUNDRED POUNDS LEFT YOU
 WHAT SHALL YOU DO NOWMARY
TAKE ANOTHER SITUATION OF COURSE AS SOON AS I CAN GET ONE
 MY FATHERHAS ENOUGH TO DO TO KEEP THE REST WITHOUT ME
 GOODBY
IN A VERY SHORT TIME STONE COURT WAS CLEARED OF WELLBREWEDFEATHERSTONES AND OTHER LONGACCUSTOMED VISITORS
 ANOTHER STRANGER HADBEEN BROUGHT TO SETTLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF MIDDLEMARCH BUT IN THECASE OF MR
 RIGG FEATHERSTONE THERE WAS MORE DISCONTENT WITH IMMEDIATEVISIBLE CONSEQUENCES THAN SPECULATION AS TO THE EFFECT WHICH HISPRESENCE MIGHT HAVE IN THE FUTURE
 NO SOUL WAS PROPHETIC ENOUGH TO HAVEANY FOREBODING AS TO WHAT MIGHT APPEAR ON THE TRIAL OF JOSHUA RIGG
AND HERE I AM NATURALLY LED TO REFLECT ON THE MEANS OF ELEVATING A LOWSUBJECT
 HISTORICAL PARALLELS ARE REMARKABLY EFFICIENT IN THIS WAY
 THECHIEF OBJECTION TO THEM IS THAT THE DILIGENT NARRATOR MAY LACK SPACEOR WHAT IS OFTEN THE SAME THING MAY NOT BE ABLE TO THINK OF THEM WITHANY DEGREE OF PARTICULARITY THOUGH HE MAY HAVE A PHILOSOPHICALCONFIDENCE THAT IF KNOWN THEY WOULD BE ILLUSTRATIVE
 IT SEEMS AN EASIERAND SHORTER WAY TO DIGNITY TO OBSERVE THATSINCE THERE NEVER WAS ATRUE STORY WHICH COULD NOT BE TOLD IN PARABLES WHERE YOU MIGHT PUT AMONKEY FOR A MARGRAVE AND VICE VERSAWHATEVER HAS BEEN OR IS TO BENARRATED BY ME ABOUT LOW PEOPLE MAY BE ENNOBLED BY BEING CONSIDERED APARABLE SO THAT IF ANY BAD HABITS AND UGLY CONSEQUENCES ARE BROUGHTINTO VIEW THE READER MAY HAVE THE RELIEF OF REGARDING THEM AS NOT MORETHAN FIGURATIVELY UNGENTEEL AND MAY FEEL HIMSELF VIRTUALLY IN COMPANYWITH PERSONS OF SOME STYLE
 THUS WHILE I TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT LOOBIESMY READERS IMAGINATION NEED NOT BE ENTIRELY EXCLUDED FROM ANOCCUPATION WITH LORDS AND THE PETTY SUMS WHICH ANY BANKRUPT OF HIGHSTANDING WOULD BE SORRY TO RETIRE UPON MAY BE LIFTED TO THE LEVEL OFHIGH COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS BY THE INEXPENSIVE ADDITION OFPROPORTIONAL CIPHERS
AS TO ANY PROVINCIAL HISTORY IN WHICH THE AGENTS ARE ALL OF HIGH MORALRANK THAT MUST BE OF A DATE LONG POSTERIOR TO THE FIRST REFORM BILLAND PETER FEATHERSTONE YOU PERCEIVE WAS DEAD AND BURIED SOME MONTHSBEFORE LORD GREY CAME INTO OFFICE
CHAPTER XXXVI

DANIEL TRAGEDY OF PHILOTAS
MR
 VINCY WENT HOME FROM THE READING OF THE WILL WITH HIS POINT OF VIEWCONSIDERABLY CHANGED IN RELATION TO MANY SUBJECTS
 HE WAS ANOPENMINDED MAN BUT GIVEN TO INDIRECT MODES OF EXPRESSING HIMSELFWHEN HE WAS DISAPPOINTED IN A MARKET FOR HIS SILK BRAIDS HE SWORE ATTHE GROOM WHEN HIS BROTHERINLAW BULSTRODE HAD VEXED HIM HE MADECUTTING REMARKS ON METHODISM AND IT WAS NOW APPARENT THAT HE REGARDEDFREDS IDLENESS WITH A SUDDEN INCREASE OF SEVERITY BY HIS THROWING ANEMBROIDERED CAP OUT OF THE SMOKINGROOM ON TO THE HALLFLOOR
WELL SIR HE OBSERVED WHEN THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN WAS MOVING OFF TOBED I HOPE YOUVE MADE UP YOUR MIND NOW TO GO UP NEXT TERM AND PASSYOUR EXAMINATION
 IVE TAKEN MY RESOLUTION SO I ADVISE YOU TO LOSE NOTIME IN TAKING YOURS
FRED MADE NO ANSWER HE WAS TOO UTTERLY DEPRESSED
 TWENTYFOUR HOURSAGO HE HAD THOUGHT THAT INSTEAD OF NEEDING TO KNOW WHAT HE SHOULD DOHE SHOULD BY THIS TIME KNOW THAT HE NEEDED TO DO NOTHING THAT HESHOULD HUNT IN PINK HAVE A FIRSTRATE HUNTER RIDE TO COVER ON A FINEHACK AND BE GENERALLY RESPECTED FOR DOING SO MOREOVER THAT HE SHOULDBE ABLE AT ONCE TO PAY MR
 GARTH AND THAT MARY COULD NO LONGER HAVEANY REASON FOR NOT MARRYING HIM
 AND ALL THIS WAS TO HAVE COME WITHOUTSTUDY OR OTHER INCONVENIENCE PURELY BY THE FAVOR OF PROVIDENCE IN THESHAPE OF AN OLD GENTLEMANS CAPRICE
 BUT NOW AT THE END OF THETWENTYFOUR HOURS ALL THOSE FIRM EXPECTATIONS WERE UPSET
 IT WASRATHER HARD LINES THAT WHILE HE WAS SMARTING UNDER THISDISAPPOINTMENT HE SHOULD BE TREATED AS IF HE COULD HAVE HELPED IT
 BUTHE WENT AWAY SILENTLY AND HIS MOTHER PLEADED FOR HIM
DONT BE HARD ON THE POOR BOY VINCY
 HELL TURN OUT WELL YET THOUGHTHAT WICKED MAN HAS DECEIVED HIM
 I FEEL AS SURE AS I SIT HERE FREDWILL TURN OUT WELLELSE WHY WAS HE BROUGHT BACK FROM THE BRINK OF THEGRAVE
 AND I CALL IT A ROBBERY IT WAS LIKE GIVING HIM THE LAND TOPROMISE IT AND WHAT IS PROMISING IF MAKING EVERYBODY BELIEVE IS NOTPROMISING
 AND YOU SEE HE DID LEAVE HIM TEN THOUSAND POUNDS AND THENTOOK IT AWAY AGAIN
TOOK IT AWAY AGAIN
 SAID MR
 VINCY PETTISHLY
 I TELL YOU THE LADSAN UNLUCKY LAD LUCY
 AND YOUVE ALWAYS SPOILED HIM
WELL VINCY HE WAS MY FIRST AND YOU MADE A FINE FUSS WITH HIM WHENHE CAME
 YOU WERE AS PROUD AS PROUD SAID MRS
 VINCY EASILYRECOVERING HER CHEERFUL SMILE
WHO KNOWS WHAT BABIES WILL TURN TO
 I WAS FOOL ENOUGH I DARE SAYSAID THE HUSBANDMORE MILDLY HOWEVER
BUT WHO HAS HANDSOMER BETTER CHILDREN THAN OURS
 FRED IS FAR BEYONDOTHER PEOPLES SONS YOU MAY HEAR IT IN HIS SPEECH THAT HE HAS KEPTCOLLEGE COMPANY
 AND ROSAMONDWHERE IS THERE A GIRL LIKE HER
 SHE MIGHTSTAND BESIDE ANY LADY IN THE LAND AND ONLY LOOK THE BETTER FOR IT
 YOUSEEMR
 LYDGATE HAS KEPT THE HIGHEST COMPANY AND BEEN EVERYWHERE ANDHE FELL IN LOVE WITH HER AT ONCE
 NOT BUT WHAT I COULD HAVE WISHEDROSAMOND HAD NOT ENGAGED HERSELF
 SHE MIGHT HAVE MET SOMEBODY ON AVISIT WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN A FAR BETTER MATCH I MEAN AT HERSCHOOLFELLOW MISS WILLOUGHBYS
 THERE ARE RELATIONS IN THAT FAMILYQUITE AS HIGH AS MR
 LYDGATES
DAMN RELATIONS
 SAID MR
 VINCY IVE HAD ENOUGH OF THEM
 I DONTWANT A SONINLAW WHO HAS GOT NOTHING BUT HIS RELATIONS TO RECOMMENDHIM
WHY MY DEAR SAID MRS
 VINCY YOU SEEMED AS PLEASED AS COULD BEABOUT IT
 ITS TRUE I WASNT AT HOME BUT ROSAMOND TOLD ME YOU HADNTA WORD TO SAY AGAINST THE ENGAGEMENT
 AND SHE HAS BEGUN TO BUY IN THEBEST LINEN AND CAMBRIC FOR HER UNDERCLOTHING
NOT BY MY WILL SAID MR
 VINCY
 I SHALL HAVE ENOUGH TO DO THIS YEARWITH AN IDLE SCAMP OF A SON WITHOUT PAYING FOR WEDDINGCLOTHES
 THETIMES ARE AS TIGHT AS CAN BE EVERYBODY IS BEING RUINED AND I DONTBELIEVE LYDGATE HAS GOT A FARTHING
 I SHANT GIVE MY CONSENT TO THEIRMARRYING
 LET EM WAIT AS THEIR ELDERS HAVE DONE BEFORE EM
ROSAMOND WILL TAKE IT HARD VINCY AND YOU KNOW YOU NEVER COULD BEARTO CROSS HER
YES I COULD
 THE SOONER THE ENGAGEMENTS OFF THE BETTER
 I DONTBELIEVE HELL EVER MAKE AN INCOME THE WAY HE GOES ON
 HE MAKESENEMIES THATS ALL I HEAR OF HIS MAKING
BUT HE STANDS VERY HIGH WITH MR
 BULSTRODE MY DEAR
 THE MARRIAGEWOULD PLEASE HIM I SHOULD THINK
PLEASE THE DEUCE
 SAID MR
 VINCY
 BULSTRODE WONT PAY FOR THEIRKEEP
 AND IF LYDGATE THINKS IM GOING TO GIVE MONEY FOR THEM TO SET UPHOUSEKEEPING HES MISTAKEN THATS ALL
 I EXPECT I SHALL HAVE TO PUTDOWN MY HORSES SOON
 YOUD BETTER TELL ROSY WHAT I SAY
THIS WAS A NOT INFREQUENT PROCEDURE WITH MR
 VINCYTO BE RASH IN JOVIALASSENT AND ON BECOMING SUBSEQUENTLY CONSCIOUS THAT HE HAD BEEN RASHTO EMPLOY OTHERS IN MAKING THE OFFENSIVE RETRACTATION
 HOWEVER MRS
VINCY WHO NEVER WILLINGLY OPPOSED HER HUSBAND LOST NO TIME THE NEXTMORNING IN LETTING ROSAMOND KNOW WHAT HE HAD SAID
 ROSAMOND EXAMININGSOME MUSLINWORK LISTENED IN SILENCE AND AT THE END GAVE A CERTAINTURN OF HER GRACEFUL NECK OF WHICH ONLY LONG EXPERIENCE COULD TEACHYOU THAT IT MEANT PERFECT OBSTINACY
WHAT DO YOU SAY MY DEAR
 SAID HER MOTHER WITH AFFECTIONATEDEFERENCE
PAPA DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING OF THE KIND SAID ROSAMOND QUITE CALMLY
HE HAS ALWAYS SAID THAT HE WISHED ME TO MARRY THE MAN I LOVED
 AND ISHALL MARRY MR
 LYDGATE
 IT IS SEVEN WEEKS NOW SINCE PAPA GAVE HISCONSENT
 AND I HOPE WE SHALL HAVE MRS
 BRETTONS HOUSE
WELL MY DEAR I SHALL LEAVE YOU TO MANAGE YOUR PAPA
 YOU ALWAYS DOMANAGE EVERYBODY
 BUT IF WE EVER DO GO AND GET DAMASK SADLERS IS THEPLACEFAR BETTER THAN HOPKINSS
 MRS
 BRETTONS IS VERY LARGE THOUGHI SHOULD LOVE YOU TO HAVE SUCH A HOUSE BUT IT WILL TAKE A GREAT DEALOF FURNITURECARPETING AND EVERYTHING BESIDES PLATE AND GLASS
 AND YOUHEAR YOUR PAPA SAYS HE WILL GIVE NO MONEY
 DO YOU THINK MR
 LYDGATEEXPECTS IT
YOU CANNOT IMAGINE THAT I SHOULD ASK HIM MAMMA
 OF COURSE HEUNDERSTANDS HIS OWN AFFAIRS
BUT HE MAY HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR MONEY MY DEAR AND WE ALL THOUGHT OFYOUR HAVING A PRETTY LEGACY AS WELL AS FREDAND NOW EVERYTHING IS SODREADFULTHERES NO PLEASURE IN THINKING OF ANYTHING WITH THAT POORBOY DISAPPOINTED AS HE IS
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY MARRIAGE MAMMA
 FRED MUST LEAVE OFFBEING IDLE
 I AM GOING UPSTAIRS TO TAKE THIS WORK TO MISS MORGAN SHEDOES THE OPEN HEMMING VERY WELL
 MARY GARTH MIGHT DO SOME WORK FOR MENOW I SHOULD THINK
 HER SEWING IS EXQUISITE IT IS THE NICEST THING IKNOW ABOUT MARY
 I SHOULD SO LIKE TO HAVE ALL MY CAMBRIC FRILLINGDOUBLEHEMMED
 AND IT TAKES A LONG TIME
MRS
 VINCYS BELIEF THAT ROSAMOND COULD MANAGE HER PAPA WAS WELLFOUNDED
 APART FROM HIS DINNERS AND HIS COURSING MR
 VINCY BLUSTERINGAS HE WAS HAD AS LITTLE OF HIS OWN WAY AS IF HE HAD BEEN A PRIMEMINISTER THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES WAS EASILY TOO MUCH FOR HIM AS ITIS FOR MOST PLEASURELOVING FLORID MEN AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE CALLEDROSAMOND WAS PARTICULARLY FORCIBLE BY MEANS OF THAT MILD PERSISTENCEWHICH AS WE KNOW ENABLES A WHITE SOFT LIVING SUBSTANCE TO MAKE ITSWAY IN SPITE OF OPPOSING ROCK
 PAPA WAS NOT A ROCK HE HAD NO OTHERFIXITY THAN THAT FIXITY OF ALTERNATING IMPULSES SOMETIMES CALLED HABITAND THIS WAS ALTOGETHER UNFAVORABLE TO HIS TAKING THE ONLY DECISIVELINE OF CONDUCT IN RELATION TO HIS DAUGHTERS ENGAGEMENTNAMELY TOINQUIRE THOROUGHLY INTO LYDGATES CIRCUMSTANCES DECLARE HIS OWNINABILITY TO FURNISH MONEY AND FORBID ALIKE EITHER A SPEEDY MARRIAGEOR AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH MUST BE TOO LENGTHY
 THAT SEEMS VERY SIMPLE ANDEASY IN THE STATEMENT BUT A DISAGREEABLE RESOLVE FORMED IN THE CHILLHOURS OF THE MORNING HAD AS MANY CONDITIONS AGAINST IT AS THE EARLYFROST AND RARELY PERSISTED UNDER THE WARMING INFLUENCES OF THE DAY
THE INDIRECT THOUGH EMPHATIC EXPRESSION OF OPINION TO WHICH MR
 VINCYWAS PRONE SUFFERED MUCH RESTRAINT IN THIS CASE LYDGATE WAS A PROUD MANTOWARDS WHOM INNUENDOES WERE OBVIOUSLY UNSAFE AND THROWING HIS HAT ONTHE FLOOR WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION
 MR
 VINCY WAS A LITTLE IN AWE OFHIM A LITTLE VAIN THAT HE WANTED TO MARRY ROSAMOND A LITTLEINDISPOSED TO RAISE A QUESTION OF MONEY IN WHICH HIS OWN POSITION WASNOT ADVANTAGEOUS A LITTLE AFRAID OF BEING WORSTED IN DIALOGUE WITH AMAN BETTER EDUCATED AND MORE HIGHLY BRED THAN HIMSELF AND A LITTLEAFRAID OF DOING WHAT HIS DAUGHTER WOULD NOT LIKE
 THE PART MR
 VINCYPREFERRED PLAYING WAS THAT OF THE GENEROUS HOST WHOM NOBODY CRITICISES
IN THE EARLIER HALF OF THE DAY THERE WAS BUSINESS TO HINDER ANY FORMALCOMMUNICATION OF AN ADVERSE RESOLVE IN THE LATER THERE WAS DINNERWINE WHIST AND GENERAL SATISFACTION
 AND IN THE MEAN WHILE THE HOURSWERE EACH LEAVING THEIR LITTLE DEPOSIT AND GRADUALLY FORMING THE FINALREASON FOR INACTION NAMELY THAT ACTION WAS TOO LATE
 THE ACCEPTEDLOVER SPENT MOST OF HIS EVENINGS IN LOWICK GATE AND A LOVEMAKING NOTAT ALL DEPENDENT ON MONEYADVANCES FROM FATHERSINLAW OR PROSPECTIVEINCOME FROM A PROFESSION WENT ON FLOURISHINGLY UNDER MR
 VINCYS OWNEYES
 YOUNG LOVEMAKINGTHAT GOSSAMER WEB
 EVEN THE POINTS IT CLINGSTOTHE THINGS WHENCE ITS SUBTLE INTERLACINGS ARE SWUNGARE SCARCELYPERCEPTIBLE MOMENTARY TOUCHES OF FINGERTIPS MEETINGS OF RAYS FROMBLUE AND DARK ORBS UNFINISHED PHRASES LIGHTEST CHANGES OF CHEEK ANDLIP FAINTEST TREMORS
 THE WEB ITSELF IS MADE OF SPONTANEOUS BELIEFSAND INDEFINABLE JOYS YEARNINGS OF ONE LIFE TOWARDS ANOTHER VISIONS OFCOMPLETENESS INDEFINITE TRUST
 AND LYDGATE FELL TO SPINNING THAT WEBFROM HIS INWARD SELF WITH WONDERFUL RAPIDITY IN SPITE OF EXPERIENCESUPPOSED TO BE FINISHED OFF WITH THE DRAMA OF LAUREIN SPITE TOO OFMEDICINE AND BIOLOGY FOR THE INSPECTION OF MACERATED MUSCLE OR OF EYESPRESENTED IN A DISH LIKE SANTA LUCIAS AND OTHER INCIDENTS OFSCIENTIFIC INQUIRY ARE OBSERVED TO BE LESS INCOMPATIBLE WITH POETICLOVE THAN A NATIVE DULNESS OR A LIVELY ADDICTION TO THE LOWEST PROSE
AS FOR ROSAMOND SHE WAS IN THE WATERLILYS EXPANDING WONDERMENT ATITS OWN FULLER LIFE AND SHE TOO WAS SPINNING INDUSTRIOUSLY AT THEMUTUAL WEB
 ALL THIS WENT ON IN THE CORNER OF THE DRAWINGROOM WHERETHE PIANO STOOD AND SUBTLE AS IT WAS THE LIGHT MADE IT A SORT OFRAINBOW VISIBLE TO MANY OBSERVERS BESIDES MR
 FAREBROTHER
 THECERTAINTY THAT MISS VINCY AND MR
 LYDGATE WERE ENGAGED BECAME GENERALIN MIDDLEMARCH WITHOUT THE AID OF FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT
AUNT BULSTRODE WAS AGAIN STIRRED TO ANXIETY BUT THIS TIME SHEADDRESSED HERSELF TO HER BROTHER GOING TO THE WAREHOUSE EXPRESSLY TOAVOID MRS
 VINCYS VOLATILITY
 HIS REPLIES WERE NOT SATISFACTORY
WALTER YOU NEVER MEAN TO TELL ME THAT YOU HAVE ALLOWED ALL THIS TO GOON WITHOUT INQUIRY INTO MR
 LYDGATES PROSPECTS
 SAID MRS
 BULSTRODEOPENING HER EYES WITH WIDER GRAVITY AT HER BROTHER WHO WAS IN HISPEEVISH WAREHOUSE HUMOR
 THINK OF THIS GIRL BROUGHT UP IN LUXURYINTOO WORLDLY A WAY I AM SORRY TO SAYWHAT WILL SHE DO ON A SMALLINCOME
OH CONFOUND IT HARRIET
 WHAT CAN I DO WHEN MEN COME INTO THE TOWNWITHOUT ANY ASKING OF MINE
 DID YOU SHUT YOUR HOUSE UP AGAINST LYDGATE
BULSTRODE HAS PUSHED HIM FORWARD MORE THAN ANYBODY
 I NEVER MADE ANYFUSS ABOUT THE YOUNG FELLOW
 YOU SHOULD GO AND TALK TO YOUR HUSBANDABOUT IT NOT ME
WELL REALLY WALTER HOW CAN MR
 BULSTRODE BE TO BLAME
 I AM SURE HEDID NOT WISH FOR THE ENGAGEMENT
OH IF BULSTRODE HAD NOT TAKEN HIM BY THE HAND I SHOULD NEVER HAVEINVITED HIM
BUT YOU CALLED HIM IN TO ATTEND ON FRED AND I AM SURE THAT WAS AMERCY SAID MRS
 BULSTRODE LOSING HER CLEW IN THE INTRICACIES OF THESUBJECT
I DONT KNOW ABOUT MERCY SAID MR
 VINCY TESTILY
 I KNOW I AMWORRIED MORE THAN I LIKE WITH MY FAMILY
 I WAS A GOOD BROTHER TO YOUHARRIET BEFORE YOU MARRIED BULSTRODE AND I MUST SAY HE DOESNT ALWAYSSHOW THAT FRIENDLY SPIRIT TOWARDS YOUR FAMILY THAT MIGHT HAVE BEENEXPECTED OF HIM
 MR
 VINCY WAS VERY LITTLE LIKE A JESUIT BUT NOACCOMPLISHED JESUIT COULD HAVE TURNED A QUESTION MORE ADROITLY
 HARRIETHAD TO DEFEND HER HUSBAND INSTEAD OF BLAMING HER BROTHER AND THECONVERSATION ENDED AT A POINT AS FAR FROM THE BEGINNING AS SOME RECENTSPARRING BETWEEN THE BROTHERSINLAW AT A VESTRY MEETING
MRS
 BULSTRODE DID NOT REPEAT HER BROTHERS COMPLAINTS TO HER HUSBANDBUT IN THE EVENING SHE SPOKE TO HIM OF LYDGATE AND ROSAMOND
 HE DID NOTSHARE HER WARM INTEREST HOWEVER AND ONLY SPOKE WITH RESIGNATION OFTHE RISKS ATTENDANT ON THE BEGINNING OF MEDICAL PRACTICE AND THEDESIRABILITY OF PRUDENCE
I AM SURE WE ARE BOUND TO PRAY FOR THAT THOUGHTLESS GIRLBROUGHT UP ASSHE HAS BEEN SAID MRS
 BULSTRODE WISHING TO ROUSE HER HUSBANDSFEELINGS
TRULY MY DEAR SAID MR
 BULSTRODE ASSENTINGLY
 THOSE WHO ARE NOTOF THIS WORLD CAN DO LITTLE ELSE TO ARREST THE ERRORS OF THEOBSTINATELY WORLDLY
 THAT IS WHAT WE MUST ACCUSTOM OURSELVES TORECOGNIZE WITH REGARD TO YOUR BROTHERS FAMILY
 I COULD HAVE WISHEDTHAT MR
 LYDGATE HAD NOT ENTERED INTO SUCH A UNION BUT MY RELATIONSWITH HIM ARE LIMITED TO THAT USE OF HIS GIFTS FOR GODS PURPOSES WHICHIS TAUGHT US BY THE DIVINE GOVERNMENT UNDER EACH DISPENSATION
MRS
 BULSTRODE SAID NO MORE ATTRIBUTING SOME DISSATISFACTION WHICH SHEFELT TO HER OWN WANT OF SPIRITUALITY
 SHE BELIEVED THAT HER HUSBAND WASONE OF THOSE MEN WHOSE MEMOIRS SHOULD BE WRITTEN WHEN THEY DIED
AS TO LYDGATE HIMSELF HAVING BEEN ACCEPTED HE WAS PREPARED TO ACCEPTALL THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO FORESEE WITH PERFECTCLEARNESS
 OF COURSE HE MUST BE MARRIED IN A YEARPERHAPS EVEN IN HALFA YEAR
 THIS WAS NOT WHAT HE HAD INTENDED BUT OTHER SCHEMES WOULD NOTBE HINDERED THEY WOULD SIMPLY ADJUST THEMSELVES ANEW
 MARRIAGE OFCOURSE MUST BE PREPARED FOR IN THE USUAL WAY
 A HOUSE MUST BE TAKENINSTEAD OF THE ROOMS HE AT PRESENT OCCUPIED AND LYDGATE HAVING HEARDROSAMOND SPEAK WITH ADMIRATION OF OLD MRS
 BRETTONS HOUSE SITUATED INLOWICK GATE TOOK NOTICE WHEN IT FELL VACANT AFTER THE OLD LADYSDEATH AND IMMEDIATELY ENTERED INTO TREATY FOR IT
HE DID THIS IN AN EPISODIC WAY VERY MUCH AS HE GAVE ORDERS TO HISTAILOR FOR EVERY REQUISITE OF PERFECT DRESS WITHOUT ANY NOTION OFBEING EXTRAVAGANT
 ON THE CONTRARY HE WOULD HAVE DESPISED ANYOSTENTATION OF EXPENSE HIS PROFESSION HAD FAMILIARIZED HIM WITH ALLGRADES OF POVERTY AND HE CARED MUCH FOR THOSE WHO SUFFERED HARDSHIPS
HE WOULD HAVE BEHAVED PERFECTLY AT A TABLE WHERE THE SAUCE WAS SERVEDIN A JUG WITH THE HANDLE OFF AND HE WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED NOTHINGABOUT A GRAND DINNER EXCEPT THAT A MAN WAS THERE WHO TALKED WELL
 BUTIT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD LIVE IN ANY OTHER THAN WHATHE WOULD HAVE CALLED AN ORDINARY WAY WITH GREEN GLASSES FOR HOCK ANDEXCELLENT WAITING AT TABLE
 IN WARMING HIMSELF AT FRENCH SOCIALTHEORIES HE HAD BROUGHT AWAY NO SMELL OF SCORCHING
 WE MAY HANDLE EVENEXTREME OPINIONS WITH IMPUNITY WHILE OUR FURNITURE OUR DINNERGIVINGAND PREFERENCE FOR ARMORIAL BEARINGS IN OUR OWN CASE LINK USINDISSOLUBLY WITH THE ESTABLISHED ORDER
 AND LYDGATES TENDENCY WAS NOTTOWARDS EXTREME OPINIONS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED NO BAREFOOTED DOCTRINESBEING PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS BOOTS HE WAS NO RADICAL IN RELATION TOANYTHING BUT MEDICAL REFORM AND THE PROSECUTION OF DISCOVERY
 IN THEREST OF PRACTICAL LIFE HE WALKED BY HEREDITARY HABIT HALF FROM THATPERSONAL PRIDE AND UNREFLECTING EGOISM WHICH I HAVE ALREADY CALLEDCOMMONNESS AND HALF FROM THAT NAIVETE WHICH BELONGED TO PREOCCUPATIONWITH FAVORITE IDEAS
ANY INWARD DEBATE LYDGATE HAD AS TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS ENGAGEMENTWHICH HAD STOLEN UPON HIM TURNED ON THE PAUCITY OF TIME RATHER THAN OFMONEY
 CERTAINLY BEING IN LOVE AND BEING EXPECTED CONTINUALLY BY SOMEONE WHO ALWAYS TURNED OUT TO BE PRETTIER THAN MEMORY COULD REPRESENTHER TO BE DID INTERFERE WITH THE DILIGENT USE OF SPARE HOURS WHICHMIGHT SERVE SOME PLODDING FELLOW OF A GERMAN TO MAKE THE GREATIMMINENT DISCOVERY
 THIS WAS REALLY AN ARGUMENT FOR NOT DEFERRING THEMARRIAGE TOO LONG AS HE IMPLIED TO MR
 FAREBROTHER ONE DAY THAT THEVICAR CAME TO HIS ROOM WITH SOME PONDPRODUCTS WHICH HE WANTED TOEXAMINE UNDER A BETTER MICROSCOPE THAN HIS OWN AND FINDING LYDGATESTABLEFUL OF APPARATUS AND SPECIMENS IN CONFUSION SAID SARCASTICALLYEROS HAS DEGENERATED HE BEGAN BY INTRODUCING ORDER AND HARMONY ANDNOW HE BRINGS BACK CHAOS
YES AT SOME STAGES SAID LYDGATE LIFTING HIS BROWS AND SMILINGWHILE HE BEGAN TO ARRANGE HIS MICROSCOPE
 BUT A BETTER ORDER WILLBEGIN AFTER
SOON
 SAID THE VICAR
I HOPE SO REALLY
 THIS UNSETTLED STATE OF AFFAIRS USES UP THE TIMEAND WHEN ONE HAS NOTIONS IN SCIENCE EVERY MOMENT IS AN OPPORTUNITY
 IFEEL SURE THAT MARRIAGE MUST BE THE BEST THING FOR A MAN WHO WANTS TOWORK STEADILY
 HE HAS EVERYTHING AT HOME THENNO TEASING WITH PERSONALSPECULATIONSHE CAN GET CALMNESS AND FREEDOM
YOU ARE AN ENVIABLE DOG SAID THE VICAR TO HAVE SUCH APROSPECTROSAMOND CALMNESS AND FREEDOM ALL TO YOUR SHARE
 HERE AM IWITH NOTHING BUT MY PIPE AND PONDANIMALCULES
 NOW ARE YOU READY
LYDGATE DID NOT MENTION TO THE VICAR ANOTHER REASON HE HAD FOR WISHINGTO SHORTEN THE PERIOD OF COURTSHIP
 IT WAS RATHER IRRITATING TO HIMEVEN WITH THE WINE OF LOVE IN HIS VEINS TO BE OBLIGED TO MINGLE SOOFTEN WITH THE FAMILY PARTY AT THE VINCYS AND TO ENTER SO MUCH INTOMIDDLEMARCH GOSSIP PROTRACTED GOOD CHEER WHISTPLAYING AND GENERALFUTILITY
 HE HAD TO BE DEFERENTIAL WHEN MR
 VINCY DECIDED QUESTIONSWITH TRENCHANT IGNORANCE ESPECIALLY AS TO THOSE LIQUORS WHICH WERE THEBEST INWARD PICKLE PRESERVING YOU FROM THE EFFECTS OF BAD AIR
 MRS
VINCYS OPENNESS AND SIMPLICITY WERE QUITE UNSTREAKED WITH SUSPICION ASTO THE SUBTLE OFFENCE SHE MIGHT GIVE TO THE TASTE OF HER INTENDEDSONINLAW AND ALTOGETHER LYDGATE HAD TO CONFESS TO HIMSELF THAT HEWAS DESCENDING A LITTLE IN RELATION TO ROSAMONDS FAMILY
 BUT THATEXQUISITE CREATURE HERSELF SUFFERED IN THE SAME SORT OF WAYIT WAS ATLEAST ONE DELIGHTFUL THOUGHT THAT IN MARRYING HER HE COULD GIVE HER AMUCHNEEDED TRANSPLANTATION
DEAR
 HE SAID TO HER ONE EVENING IN HIS GENTLEST TONE AS HE SATDOWN BY HER AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT HER FACEBUT I MUST FIRST SAY THAT HE HAD FOUND HER ALONE IN THE DRAWINGROOMWHERE THE GREAT OLDFASHIONED WINDOW ALMOST AS LARGE AS THE SIDE OFTHE ROOM WAS OPENED TO THE SUMMER SCENTS OF THE GARDEN AT THE BACK OFTHE HOUSE
 HER FATHER AND MOTHER WERE GONE TO A PARTY AND THE RESTWERE ALL OUT WITH THE BUTTERFLIES
DEAR
 YOUR EYELIDS ARE RED
ARE THEY
 SAID ROSAMOND
 I WONDER WHY
 IT WAS NOT IN HER NATURE TOPOUR FORTH WISHES OR GRIEVANCES
 THEY ONLY CAME FORTH GRACEFULLY ONSOLICITATION
AS IF YOU COULD HIDE IT FROM ME
 SAID LYDGATE LAYING HIS HANDTENDERLY ON BOTH OF HERS
 DONT I SEE A TINY DROP ON ONE OF THELASHES
 THINGS TROUBLE YOU AND YOU DONT TELL ME
 THAT IS UNLOVING
WHY SHOULD I TELL YOU WHAT YOU CANNOT ALTER
 THEY ARE EVERYDAYTHINGSPERHAPS THEY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE WORSE LATELY
FAMILY ANNOYANCES
 DONT FEAR SPEAKING
 I GUESS THEM
PAPA HAS BEEN MORE IRRITABLE LATELY
 FRED MAKES HIM ANGRY AND THISMORNING THERE WAS A FRESH QUARREL BECAUSE FRED THREATENS TO THROW HISWHOLE EDUCATION AWAY AND DO SOMETHING QUITE BENEATH HIM
 AND BESIDESROSAMOND HESITATED AND HER CHEEKS WERE GATHERING A SLIGHT FLUSH
LYDGATE HAD NEVER SEEN HER IN TROUBLE SINCE THE MORNING OF THEIRENGAGEMENT AND HE HAD NEVER FELT SO PASSIONATELY TOWARDS HER AS ATTHIS MOMENT
 HE KISSED THE HESITATING LIPS GENTLY AS IF TO ENCOURAGETHEM
I FEEL THAT PAPA IS NOT QUITE PLEASED ABOUT OUR ENGAGEMENT ROSAMONDCONTINUED ALMOST IN A WHISPER AND HE SAID LAST NIGHT THAT HE SHOULDCERTAINLY SPEAK TO YOU AND SAY IT MUST BE GIVEN UP
WILL YOU GIVE IT UP
 SAID LYDGATE WITH QUICK ENERGYALMOST ANGRILY
I NEVER GIVE UP ANYTHING THAT I CHOOSE TO DO SAID ROSAMONDRECOVERING HER CALMNESS AT THE TOUCHING OF THIS CHORD
GOD BLESS YOU
 SAID LYDGATE KISSING HER AGAIN
 THIS CONSTANCY OFPURPOSE IN THE RIGHT PLACE WAS ADORABLE
 HE WENT ONIT IS TOO LATE NOW FOR YOUR FATHER TO SAY THAT OUR ENGAGEMENT MUST BEGIVEN UP
 YOU ARE OF AGE AND I CLAIM YOU AS MINE
 IF ANYTHING IS DONETO MAKE YOU UNHAPPYTHAT IS A REASON FOR HASTENING OUR MARRIAGE
AN UNMISTAKABLE DELIGHT SHONE FORTH FROM THE BLUE EYES THAT MET HISAND THE RADIANCE SEEMED TO LIGHT UP ALL HIS FUTURE WITH MILD SUNSHINE
IDEAL HAPPINESS OF THE KIND KNOWN IN THE ARABIAN NIGHTS IN WHICH YOUARE INVITED TO STEP FROM THE LABOR AND DISCORD OF THE STREET INTO APARADISE WHERE EVERYTHING IS GIVEN TO YOU AND NOTHING CLAIMED SEEMEDTO BE AN AFFAIR OF A FEW WEEKS WAITING MORE OR LESS
WHY SHOULD WE DEFER IT
 HE SAID WITH ARDENT INSISTENCE
 I HAVETAKEN THE HOUSE NOW EVERYTHING ELSE CAN SOON BE GOT READYCAN IT NOT
YOU WILL NOT MIND ABOUT NEW CLOTHES
 THOSE CAN BE BOUGHT AFTERWARDS
WHAT ORIGINAL NOTIONS YOU CLEVER MEN HAVE
 SAID ROSAMOND DIMPLINGWITH MORE THOROUGH LAUGHTER THAN USUAL AT THIS HUMOROUS INCONGRUITY
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I EVER HEARD OF WEDDINGCLOTHES BEING BOUGHTAFTER MARRIAGE
BUT YOU DONT MEAN TO SAY YOU WOULD INSIST ON MY WAITING MONTHS FORTHE SAKE OF CLOTHES
 SAID LYDGATE HALF THINKING THAT ROSAMOND WASTORMENTING HIM PRETTILY AND HALF FEARING THAT SHE REALLY SHRANK FROMSPEEDY MARRIAGE
 REMEMBER WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO A BETTER SORT OFHAPPINESS EVEN THAN THISBEING CONTINUALLY TOGETHER INDEPENDENT OFOTHERS AND ORDERING OUR LIVES AS WE WILL
 COME DEAR TELL ME HOW SOONYOU CAN BE ALTOGETHER MINE
THERE WAS A SERIOUS PLEADING IN LYDGATES TONE AS IF HE FELT THAT SHEWOULD BE INJURING HIM BY ANY FANTASTIC DELAYS
 ROSAMOND BECAME SERIOUSTOO AND SLIGHTLY MEDITATIVE IN FACT SHE WAS GOING THROUGH MANYINTRICACIES OF LACEEDGING AND HOSIERY AND PETTICOATTUCKING IN ORDERTO GIVE AN ANSWER THAT WOULD AT LEAST BE APPROXIMATIVE
SIX WEEKS WOULD BE AMPLESAY SO ROSAMOND INSISTED LYDGATERELEASING HER HANDS TO PUT HIS ARM GENTLY ROUND HER
ONE LITTLE HAND IMMEDIATELY WENT TO PAT HER HAIR WHILE SHE GAVE HERNECK A MEDITATIVE TURN AND THEN SAID SERIOUSLYTHERE WOULD BE THE HOUSELINEN AND THE FURNITURE TO BE PREPARED
STILL MAMMA COULD SEE TO THOSE WHILE WE WERE AWAY
YES TO BE SURE
 WE MUST BE AWAY A WEEK OR SO
OH MORE THAN THAT
 SAID ROSAMOND EARNESTLY
 SHE WAS THINKING OF HEREVENING DRESSES FOR THE VISIT TO SIR GODWIN LYDGATES WHICH SHE HADLONG BEEN SECRETLY HOPING FOR AS A DELIGHTFUL EMPLOYMENT OF AT LEASTONE QUARTER OF THE HONEYMOON EVEN IF SHE DEFERRED HER INTRODUCTION TOTHE UNCLE WHO WAS A DOCTOR OF DIVINITY ALSO A PLEASING THOUGH SOBERKIND OF RANK WHEN SUSTAINED BY BLOOD
 SHE LOOKED AT HER LOVER WITHSOME WONDERING REMONSTRANCE AS SHE SPOKE AND HE READILY UNDERSTOODTHAT SHE MIGHT WISH TO LENGTHEN THE SWEET TIME OF DOUBLE SOLITUDE
WHATEVER YOU WISH MY DARLING WHEN THE DAY IS FIXED
 BUT LET US TAKEA DECIDED COURSE AND PUT AN END TO ANY DISCOMFORT YOU MAY BESUFFERING
 SIX WEEKS
I AM SURE THEY WOULD BE AMPLE
I COULD CERTAINLY HASTEN THE WORK SAID ROSAMOND
 WILL YOU THENMENTION IT TO PAPA
I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO WRITE TO HIM
 SHEBLUSHED AND LOOKED AT HIM AS THE GARDEN FLOWERS LOOK AT US WHEN WE WALKFORTH HAPPILY AMONG THEM IN THE TRANSCENDENT EVENING LIGHT IS THERENOT A SOUL BEYOND UTTERANCE HALF NYMPH HALF CHILD IN THOSE DELICATEPETALS WHICH GLOW AND BREATHE ABOUT THE CENTRES OF DEEP COLOR
HE TOUCHED HER EAR AND A LITTLE BIT OF NECK UNDER IT WITH HIS LIPS ANDTHEY SAT QUITE STILL FOR MANY MINUTES WHICH FLOWED BY THEM LIKE A SMALLGURGLING BROOK WITH THE KISSES OF THE SUN UPON IT
 ROSAMOND THOUGHTTHAT NO ONE COULD BE MORE IN LOVE THAN SHE WAS AND LYDGATE THOUGHTTHAT AFTER ALL HIS WILD MISTAKES AND ABSURD CREDULITY HE HAD FOUNDPERFECT WOMANHOODFELT AS IF ALREADY BREATHED UPON BY EXQUISITE WEDDEDAFFECTION SUCH AS WOULD BE BESTOWED BY AN ACCOMPLISHED CREATURE WHOVENERATED HIS HIGH MUSINGS AND MOMENTOUS LABORS AND WOULD NEVERINTERFERE WITH THEM WHO WOULD CREATE ORDER IN THE HOME AND ACCOUNTSWITH STILL MAGIC YET KEEP HER FINGERS READY TO TOUCH THE LUTE ANDTRANSFORM LIFE INTO ROMANCE AT ANY MOMENT WHO WAS INSTRUCTED TO THETRUE WOMANLY LIMIT AND NOT A HAIRSBREADTH BEYONDDOCILE THEREFOREAND READY TO CARRY OUT BEHESTS WHICH CAME FROM THAT LIMIT
 IT WASPLAINER NOW THAN EVER THAT HIS NOTION OF REMAINING MUCH LONGER ABACHELOR HAD BEEN A MISTAKE MARRIAGE WOULD NOT BE AN OBSTRUCTION BUT AFURTHERANCE
 AND HAPPENING THE NEXT DAY TO ACCOMPANY A PATIENT TOBRASSING HE SAW A DINNERSERVICE THERE WHICH STRUCK HIM AS SO EXACTLYTHE RIGHT THING THAT HE BOUGHT IT AT ONCE
 IT SAVED TIME TO DO THESETHINGS JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT OF THEM AND LYDGATE HATED UGLY CROCKERY
THE DINNERSERVICE IN QUESTION WAS EXPENSIVE BUT THAT MIGHT BE IN THENATURE OF DINNERSERVICES
 FURNISHING WAS NECESSARILY EXPENSIVE BUTTHEN IT HAD TO BE DONE ONLY ONCE
IT MUST BE LOVELY SAID MRS
 VINCY WHEN LYDGATE MENTIONED HISPURCHASE WITH SOME DESCRIPTIVE TOUCHES
 JUST WHAT ROSY OUGHT TO HAVE
I TRUST IN HEAVEN IT WONT BE BROKEN
ONE MUST HIRE SERVANTS WHO WILL NOT BREAK THINGS SAID LYDGATE
CERTAINLY THIS WAS REASONING WITH AN IMPERFECT VISION OF SEQUENCES
BUT AT THAT PERIOD THERE WAS NO SORT OF REASONING WHICH WAS NOT MORE ORLESS SANCTIONED BY MEN OF SCIENCE
OF COURSE IT WAS UNNECESSARY TO DEFER THE MENTION OF ANYTHING TO MAMMAWHO DID NOT READILY TAKE VIEWS THAT WERE NOT CHEERFUL AND BEING AHAPPY WIFE HERSELF HAD HARDLY ANY FEELING BUT PRIDE IN HER DAUGHTERSMARRIAGE
 BUT ROSAMOND HAD GOOD REASONS FOR SUGGESTING TO LYDGATE THATPAPA SHOULD BE APPEALED TO IN WRITING
 SHE PREPARED FOR THE ARRIVAL OFTHE LETTER BY WALKING WITH HER PAPA TO THE WAREHOUSE THE NEXT MORNINGAND TELLING HIM ON THE WAY THAT MR
 LYDGATE WISHED TO BE MARRIED SOON
NONSENSE MY DEAR
 SAID MR
 VINCY
 WHAT HAS HE GOT TO MARRY ON
YOUD MUCH BETTER GIVE UP THE ENGAGEMENT
 IVE TOLD YOU SO PRETTYPLAINLY BEFORE THIS
 WHAT HAVE YOU HAD SUCH AN EDUCATION FOR IF YOUARE TO GO AND MARRY A POOR MAN
 ITS A CRUEL THING FOR A FATHER TOSEE
MR
 LYDGATE IS NOT POOR PAPA
 HE BOUGHT MR
 PEACOCKS PRACTICEWHICH THEY SAY IS WORTH EIGHT OR NINE HUNDRED AYEAR
STUFF AND NONSENSE
 WHATS BUYING A PRACTICE
 HE MIGHT AS WELL BUYNEXT YEARS SWALLOWS
 ITLL ALL SLIP THROUGH HIS FINGERS
ON THE CONTRARY PAPA HE WILL INCREASE THE PRACTICE
 SEE HOW HE HASBEEN CALLED IN BY THE CHETTAMS AND CASAUBONS
I HOPE HE KNOWS I SHANT GIVE ANYTHINGWITH THIS DISAPPOINTMENT ABOUTFRED AND PARLIAMENT GOING TO BE DISSOLVED AND MACHINEBREAKINGEVERYWHERE AND AN ELECTION COMING ONDEAR PAPA
 WHAT CAN THAT HAVE TO DO WITH MY MARRIAGE
A PRETTY DEAL TO DO WITH IT
 WE MAY ALL BE RUINED FOR WHAT I KNOWTHECOUNTRYS IN THAT STATE
 SOME SAY ITS THE END OF THE WORLD AND BEHANGED IF I DONT THINK IT LOOKS LIKE IT
 ANYHOW ITS NOT A TIME FORME TO BE DRAWING MONEY OUT OF MY BUSINESS AND I SHOULD WISH LYDGATE TOKNOW THAT
I AM SURE HE EXPECTS NOTHING PAPA
 AND HE HAS SUCH VERY HIGHCONNECTIONS HE IS SURE TO RISE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
 HE IS ENGAGED INMAKING SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES
MR
 VINCY WAS SILENT
I CANNOT GIVE UP MY ONLY PROSPECT OF HAPPINESS PAPA
 MR
 LYDGATE IS AGENTLEMAN
 I COULD NEVER LOVE ANY ONE WHO WAS NOT A PERFECT GENTLEMAN
YOU WOULD NOT LIKE ME TO GO INTO A CONSUMPTION AS ARABELLA HAWLEY DID
AND YOU KNOW THAT I NEVER CHANGE MY MIND
AGAIN PAPA WAS SILENT
PROMISE ME PAPA THAT YOU WILL CONSENT TO WHAT WE WISH
 WE SHALLNEVER GIVE EACH OTHER UP AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS OBJECTED TOLONG COURTSHIPS AND LATE MARRIAGES
THERE WAS A LITTLE MORE URGENCY OF THIS KIND TILL MR
 VINCY SAIDWELL WELL CHILD HE MUST WRITE TO ME FIRST BEFORE I CAN ANSWERHIMAND ROSAMOND WAS CERTAIN THAT SHE HAD GAINED HER POINT
MR
 VINCYS ANSWER CONSISTED CHIEFLY IN A DEMAND THAT LYDGATE SHOULDINSURE HIS LIFEA DEMAND IMMEDIATELY CONCEDED
 THIS WAS A DELIGHTFULLYREASSURING IDEA SUPPOSING THAT LYDGATE DIED BUT IN THE MEAN TIME NOT ASELFSUPPORTING IDEA
 HOWEVER IT SEEMED TO MAKE EVERYTHING COMFORTABLEABOUT ROSAMONDS MARRIAGE AND THE NECESSARY PURCHASES WENT ON WITHMUCH SPIRIT
 NOT WITHOUT PRUDENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS HOWEVER
 A BRIDEWHO IS GOING TO VISIT AT A BARONETS MUST HAVE A FEW FIRSTRATEPOCKETHANDKERCHIEFS BUT BEYOND THE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY HALFDOZENROSAMOND CONTENTED HERSELF WITHOUT THE VERY HIGHEST STYLE OF EMBROIDERYAND VALENCIENNES
 LYDGATE ALSO FINDING THAT HIS SUM OF EIGHT HUNDREDPOUNDS HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLY REDUCED SINCE HE HAD COME TO MIDDLEMARCHRESTRAINED HIS INCLINATION FOR SOME PLATE OF AN OLD PATTERN WHICH WASSHOWN TO HIM WHEN HE WENT INTO KIBBLES ESTABLISHMENT AT BRASSING TOBUY FORKS AND SPOONS
 HE WAS TOO PROUD TO ACT AS IF HE PRESUPPOSED THATMR
 VINCY WOULD ADVANCE MONEY TO PROVIDE FURNITURE AND THOUGH SINCEIT WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING AT ONCE SOME BILLSWOULD BE LEFT STANDING OVER HE DID NOT WASTE TIME IN CONJECTURING HOWMUCH HIS FATHERINLAW WOULD GIVE IN THE FORM OF DOWRY TO MAKE PAYMENTEASY
 HE WAS NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING EXTRAVAGANT BUT THE REQUISITETHINGS MUST BE BOUGHT AND IT WOULD BE BAD ECONOMY TO BUY THEM OF APOOR QUALITY
 ALL THESE MATTERS WERE BY THE BYE
 LYDGATE FORESAW THATSCIENCE AND HIS PROFESSION WERE THE OBJECTS HE SHOULD ALONE PURSUEENTHUSIASTICALLY BUT HE COULD NOT IMAGINE HIMSELF PURSUING THEM INSUCH A HOME AS WRENCH HADTHE DOORS ALL OPEN THE OILCLOTH WORN THECHILDREN IN SOILED PINAFORES AND LUNCH LINGERING IN THE FORM OF BONESBLACKHANDLED KNIVES AND WILLOWPATTERN
 BUT WRENCH HAD A WRETCHEDLYMPHATIC WIFE WHO MADE A MUMMY OF HERSELF INDOORS IN A LARGE SHAWLAND HE MUST HAVE ALTOGETHER BEGUN WITH AN ILLCHOSEN DOMESTICAPPARATUS
ROSAMOND HOWEVER WAS ON HER SIDE MUCH OCCUPIED WITH CONJECTURESTHOUGH HER QUICK IMITATIVE PERCEPTION WARNED HER AGAINST BETRAYING THEMTOO CRUDELY
I SHALL LIKE SO MUCH TO KNOW YOUR FAMILY SHE SAID ONE DAY WHEN THEWEDDING JOURNEY WAS BEING DISCUSSED
 WE MIGHT PERHAPS TAKE A DIRECTIONTHAT WOULD ALLOW US TO SEE THEM AS WE RETURNED
 WHICH OF YOUR UNCLES DOYOU LIKE BEST
OHMY UNCLE GODWIN I THINK
 HE IS A GOODNATURED OLD FELLOW
YOU WERE CONSTANTLY AT HIS HOUSE AT QUALLINGHAM WHEN YOU WERE A BOYWERE YOU NOT
 I SHOULD SO LIKE TO SEE THE OLD SPOT AND EVERYTHING YOUWERE USED TO
 DOES HE KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO BE MARRIED
NO SAID LYDGATE CARELESSLY TURNING IN HIS CHAIR AND RUBBING HISHAIR UP
DO SEND HIM WORD OF IT YOU NAUGHTY UNDUTIFUL NEPHEW
 HE WILL PERHAPSASK YOU TO TAKE ME TO QUALLINGHAM AND THEN YOU COULD SHOW ME ABOUT THEGROUNDS AND I COULD IMAGINE YOU THERE WHEN YOU WERE A BOY
 REMEMBERYOU SEE ME IN MY HOME JUST AS IT HAS BEEN SINCE I WAS A CHILD
 IT ISNOT FAIR THAT I SHOULD BE SO IGNORANT OF YOURS
 BUT PERHAPS YOU WOULDBE A LITTLE ASHAMED OF ME
 I FORGOT THAT
LYDGATE SMILED AT HER TENDERLY AND REALLY ACCEPTED THE SUGGESTION THATTHE PROUD PLEASURE OF SHOWING SO CHARMING A BRIDE WAS WORTH SOMETROUBLE
 AND NOW HE CAME TO THINK OF IT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE OLDSPOTS WITH ROSAMOND
I WILL WRITE TO HIM THEN
 BUT MY COUSINS ARE BORES
IT SEEMED MAGNIFICENT TO ROSAMOND TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK SO SLIGHTINGLY OFA BARONETS FAMILY AND SHE FELT MUCH CONTENTMENT IN THE PROSPECT OFBEING ABLE TO ESTIMATE THEM CONTEMPTUOUSLY ON HER OWN ACCOUNT
BUT MAMMA WAS NEAR SPOILING ALL A DAY OR TWO LATER BY SAYINGI HOPE YOUR UNCLE SIR GODWIN WILL NOT LOOK DOWN ON ROSY MR
 LYDGATE
I SHOULD THINK HE WOULD DO SOMETHING HANDSOME
 A THOUSAND OR TWO CAN BENOTHING TO A BARONET
MAMMA
 SAID ROSAMOND BLUSHING DEEPLY AND LYDGATE PITIED HER SO MUCHTHAT HE REMAINED SILENT AND WENT TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM TOEXAMINE A PRINT CURIOUSLY AS IF HE HAD BEEN ABSENTMINDED
 MAMMA HAD ALITTLE FILIAL LECTURE AFTERWARDS AND WAS DOCILE AS USUAL
 BUT ROSAMONDREFLECTED THAT IF ANY OF THOSE HIGHBRED COUSINS WHO WERE BORES SHOULDBE INDUCED TO VISIT MIDDLEMARCH THEY WOULD SEE MANY THINGS IN HER OWNFAMILY WHICH MIGHT SHOCK THEM
 HENCE IT SEEMED DESIRABLE THAT LYDGATESHOULD BYANDBY GET SOME FIRSTRATE POSITION ELSEWHERE THAN INMIDDLEMARCH AND THIS COULD HARDLY BE DIFFICULT IN THE CASE OF A MANWHO HAD A TITLED UNCLE AND COULD MAKE DISCOVERIES
 LYDGATE YOUPERCEIVE HAD TALKED FERVIDLY TO ROSAMOND OF HIS HOPES AS TO THEHIGHEST USES OF HIS LIFE AND HAD FOUND IT DELIGHTFUL TO BE LISTENED TOBY A CREATURE WHO WOULD BRING HIM THE SWEET FURTHERANCE OF SATISFYINGAFFECTIONBEAUTYREPOSESUCH HELP AS OUR THOUGHTS GET FROM THE SUMMERSKY AND THE FLOWERFRINGED MEADOWS

THE DOUBT HINTED BY MR
 VINCY WHETHER IT WERE ONLY THE GENERAL ELECTIONOR THE END OF THE WORLD THAT WAS COMING ON NOW THAT GEORGE THE FOURTHWAS DEAD PARLIAMENT DISSOLVED WELLINGTON AND PEEL GENERALLYDEPRECIATED AND THE NEW KING APOLOGETIC WAS A FEEBLE TYPE OF THEUNCERTAINTIES IN PROVINCIAL OPINION AT THAT TIME
 WITH THE GLOWWORMLIGHTS OF COUNTRY PLACES HOW COULD MEN SEE WHICH WERE THEIR OWNTHOUGHTS IN THE CONFUSION OF A TORY MINISTRY PASSING LIBERAL MEASURESOF TORY NOBLES AND ELECTORS BEING ANXIOUS TO RETURN LIBERALS RATHERTHAN FRIENDS OF THE RECREANT MINISTERS AND OF OUTCRIES FOR REMEDIESWHICH SEEMED TO HAVE A MYSTERIOUSLY REMOTE BEARING ON PRIVATE INTERESTAND WERE MADE SUSPICIOUS BY THE ADVOCACY OF DISAGREEABLE NEIGHBORS
BUYERS OF THE MIDDLEMARCH NEWSPAPERS FOUND THEMSELVES IN AN ANOMALOUSPOSITION DURING THE AGITATION ON THE CATHOLIC QUESTION MANY HAD GIVENUP THE PIONEERWHICH HAD A MOTTO FROM CHARLES JAMES FOX AND WAS INTHE VAN OF PROGRESSBECAUSE IT HAD TAKEN PEELS SIDE ABOUT THE PAPISTSAND HAD THUS BLOTTED ITS LIBERALISM WITH A TOLERATION OF JESUITRY ANDBAAL BUT THEY WERE ILLSATISFIED WITH THE TRUMPET WHICHSINCE ITSBLASTS AGAINST ROME AND IN THE GENERAL FLACCIDITY OF THE PUBLIC MINDNOBODY KNOWING WHO WOULD SUPPORT WHOMHAD BECOME FEEBLE IN ITSBLOWING
IT WAS A TIME ACCORDING TO A NOTICEABLE ARTICLE IN THE PIONEER WHENTHE CRYING NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY MIGHT WELL COUNTERACT A RELUCTANCE TOPUBLIC ACTION ON THE PART OF MEN WHOSE MINDS HAD FROM LONG EXPERIENCEACQUIRED BREADTH AS WELL AS CONCENTRATION DECISION OF JUDGMENT AS WELLAS TOLERANCE DISPASSIONATENESS AS WELL AS ENERGYIN FACT ALL THOSEQUALITIES WHICH IN THE MELANCHOLY EXPERIENCE OF MANKIND HAVE BEEN THELEAST DISPOSED TO SHARE LODGINGS
MR
 HACKBUTT WHOSE FLUENT SPEECH WAS AT THAT TIME FLOATING MORE WIDELYTHAN USUAL AND LEAVING MUCH UNCERTAINTY AS TO ITS ULTIMATE CHANNELWAS HEARD TO SAY IN MR
 HAWLEYS OFFICE THAT THE ARTICLE IN QUESTIONEMANATED FROM BROOKE OF TIPTON AND THAT BROOKE HAD SECRETLY BOUGHTTHE PIONEER SOME MONTHS AGO
THAT MEANS MISCHIEF EH
 SAID MR
 HAWLEY
 HES GOT THE FREAK OFBEING A POPULAR MAN NOW AFTER DANGLING ABOUT LIKE A STRAY TORTOISE
 SOMUCH THE WORSE FOR HIM
 IVE HAD MY EYE ON HIM FOR SOME TIME
 HE SHALLBE PRETTILY PUMPED UPON
 HES A DAMNED BAD LANDLORD
 WHAT BUSINESS HASAN OLD COUNTY MAN TO COME CURRYING FAVOR WITH A LOW SET OF DARKBLUEFREEMEN
 AS TO HIS PAPER I ONLY HOPE HE MAY DO THE WRITING HIMSELF
 ITWOULD BE WORTH OUR PAYING FOR
I UNDERSTAND HE HAS GOT A VERY BRILLIANT YOUNG FELLOW TO EDIT IT WHOCAN WRITE THE HIGHEST STYLE OF LEADING ARTICLE QUITE EQUAL TO ANYTHINGIN THE LONDON PAPERS
 AND HE MEANS TO TAKE VERY HIGH GROUND ON REFORM
LET BROOKE REFORM HIS RENTROLL
 HES A CURSED OLD SCREW AND THEBUILDINGS ALL OVER HIS ESTATE ARE GOING TO RACK
 I SUPPOSE THIS YOUNGFELLOW IS SOME LOOSE FISH FROM LONDON
HIS NAME IS LADISLAW
 HE IS SAID TO BE OF FOREIGN EXTRACTION
I KNOW THE SORT SAID MR
 HAWLEY SOME EMISSARY
 HELL BEGIN WITHFLOURISHING ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF MAN AND END WITH MURDERING A WENCH
THATS THE STYLE
YOU MUST CONCEDE THAT THERE ARE ABUSES HAWLEY SAID MR
 HACKBUTTFORESEEING SOME POLITICAL DISAGREEMENT WITH HIS FAMILY LAWYER
 IMYSELF SHOULD NEVER FAVOR IMMODERATE VIEWSIN FACT I TAKE MY STAND WITHHUSKISSONBUT I CANNOT BLIND MYSELF TO THE CONSIDERATION THAT THENONREPRESENTATION OF LARGE TOWNSLARGE TOWNS BE DAMNED
 SAID MR
 HAWLEY IMPATIENT OF EXPOSITION
 IKNOW A LITTLE TOO MUCH ABOUT MIDDLEMARCH ELECTIONS
 LET EM QUASH EVERYPOCKET BOROUGH TOMORROW AND BRING IN EVERY MUSHROOM TOWN IN THEKINGDOMTHEYLL ONLY INCREASE THE EXPENSE OF GETTING INTO PARLIAMENT
 IGO UPON FACTS
MR
 HAWLEYS DISGUST AT THE NOTION OF THE PIONEER BEING EDITED BY ANEMISSARY AND OF BROOKE BECOMING ACTIVELY POLITICALAS IF A TORTOISE OFDESULTORY PURSUITS SHOULD PROTRUDE ITS SMALL HEAD AMBITIOUSLY ANDBECOME RAMPANTWAS HARDLY EQUAL TO THE ANNOYANCE FELT BY SOME MEMBERSOF MR
 BROOKES OWN FAMILY
 THE RESULT HAD OOZED FORTH GRADUALLY LIKETHE DISCOVERY THAT YOUR NEIGHBOR HAS SET UP AN UNPLEASANT KIND OFMANUFACTURE WHICH WILL BE PERMANENTLY UNDER YOUR NOSTRILS WITHOUT LEGALREMEDY
 THE PIONEER HAD BEEN SECRETLY BOUGHT EVEN BEFORE WILLLADISLAWS ARRIVAL THE EXPECTED OPPORTUNITY HAVING OFFERED ITSELF INTHE READINESS OF THE PROPRIETOR TO PART WITH A VALUABLE PROPERTY WHICHDID NOT PAY AND IN THE INTERVAL SINCE MR
 BROOKE HAD WRITTEN HISINVITATION THOSE GERMINAL IDEAS OF MAKING HIS MIND TELL UPON THE WORLDAT LARGE WHICH HAD BEEN PRESENT IN HIM FROM HIS YOUNGER YEARS BUT HADHITHERTO LAIN IN SOME OBSTRUCTION HAD BEEN SPROUTING UNDER COVER
THE DEVELOPMENT WAS MUCH FURTHERED BY A DELIGHT IN HIS GUEST WHICHPROVED GREATER EVEN THAN HE HAD ANTICIPATED
 FOR IT SEEMED THAT WILLWAS NOT ONLY AT HOME IN ALL THOSE ARTISTIC AND LITERARY SUBJECTS WHICHMR
 BROOKE HAD GONE INTO AT ONE TIME BUT THAT HE WAS STRIKINGLY READYAT SEIZING THE POINTS OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION AND DEALING WITH THEMIN THAT LARGE SPIRIT WHICH AIDED BY ADEQUATE MEMORY LENDS ITSELF TOQUOTATION AND GENERAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TREATMENT
HE SEEMS TO ME A KIND OF SHELLEY YOU KNOW MR
 BROOKE TOOK ANOPPORTUNITY OF SAYING FOR THE GRATIFICATION OF MR
 CASAUBON
 I DONTMEAN AS TO ANYTHING OBJECTIONABLELAXITIES OR ATHEISM OR ANYTHING OFTHAT KIND YOU KNOWLADISLAWS SENTIMENTS IN EVERY WAY I AM SURE AREGOODINDEED WE WERE TALKING A GREAT DEAL TOGETHER LAST NIGHT
 BUT HEHAS THE SAME SORT OF ENTHUSIASM FOR LIBERTY FREEDOM EMANCIPATIONAFINE THING UNDER GUIDANCEUNDER GUIDANCE YOU KNOW
 I THINK I SHALL BEABLE TO PUT HIM ON THE RIGHT TACK AND I AM THE MORE PLEASED BECAUSE HEIS A RELATION OF YOURS CASAUBON
IF THE RIGHT TACK IMPLIED ANYTHING MORE PRECISE THAN THE REST OF MR
BROOKES SPEECH MR
 CASAUBON SILENTLY HOPED THAT IT REFERRED TO SOMEOCCUPATION AT A GREAT DISTANCE FROM LOWICK
 HE HAD DISLIKED WILL WHILEHE HELPED HIM BUT HE HAD BEGUN TO DISLIKE HIM STILL MORE NOW THAT WILLHAD DECLINED HIS HELP
 THAT IS THE WAY WITH US WHEN WE HAVE ANY UNEASYJEALOUSY IN OUR DISPOSITION IF OUR TALENTS ARE CHIEFLY OF THEBURROWING KIND OUR HONEYSIPPING COUSIN WHOM WE HAVE GRAVE REASONSFOR OBJECTING TO IS LIKELY TO HAVE A SECRET CONTEMPT FOR US AND ANYONE WHO ADMIRES HIM PASSES AN OBLIQUE CRITICISM ON OURSELVES
 HAVINGTHE SCRUPLES OF RECTITUDE IN OUR SOULS WE ARE ABOVE THE MEANNESS OFINJURING HIMRATHER WE MEET ALL HIS CLAIMS ON US BY ACTIVE BENEFITSAND THE DRAWING OF CHEQUES FOR HIM BEING A SUPERIORITY WHICH HE MUSTRECOGNIZE GIVES OUR BITTERNESS A MILDER INFUSION
 NOW MR
 CASAUBON HADBEEN DEPRIVED OF THAT SUPERIORITY AS ANYTHING MORE THAN A REMEMBRANCEIN A SUDDEN CAPRICIOUS MANNER
 HIS ANTIPATHY TO WILL DID NOT SPRINGFROM THE COMMON JEALOUSY OF A WINTERWORN HUSBAND IT WAS SOMETHINGDEEPER BRED BY HIS LIFELONG CLAIMS AND DISCONTENTS BUT DOROTHEA NOWTHAT SHE WAS PRESENTDOROTHEA AS A YOUNG WIFE WHO HERSELF HAD SHOWN ANOFFENSIVE CAPABILITY OF CRITICISM NECESSARILY GAVE CONCENTRATION TOTHE UNEASINESS WHICH HAD BEFORE BEEN VAGUE
WILL LADISLAW ON HIS SIDE FELT THAT HIS DISLIKE WAS FLOURISHING AT THEEXPENSE OF HIS GRATITUDE AND SPENT MUCH INWARD DISCOURSE IN JUSTIFYINGTHE DISLIKE
 CASAUBON HATED HIMHE KNEW THAT VERY WELL ON HIS FIRSTENTRANCE HE COULD DISCERN A BITTERNESS IN THE MOUTH AND A VENOM IN THEGLANCE WHICH WOULD ALMOST JUSTIFY DECLARING WAR IN SPITE OF PASTBENEFITS
 HE WAS MUCH OBLIGED TO CASAUBON IN THE PAST BUT REALLY THEACT OF MARRYING THIS WIFE WAS A SETOFF AGAINST THE OBLIGATION
 IT WASA QUESTION WHETHER GRATITUDE WHICH REFERS TO WHAT IS DONE FOR ONESSELF OUGHT NOT TO GIVE WAY TO INDIGNATION AT WHAT IS DONE AGAINSTANOTHER
 AND CASAUBON HAD DONE A WRONG TO DOROTHEA IN MARRYING HER
 AMAN WAS BOUND TO KNOW HIMSELF BETTER THAN THAT AND IF HE CHOSE TO GROWGRAY CRUNCHING BONES IN A CAVERN HE HAD NO BUSINESS TO BE LURING AGIRL INTO HIS COMPANIONSHIP
 IT IS THE MOST HORRIBLE OFVIRGINSACRIFICES SAID WILL AND HE PAINTED TO HIMSELF WHAT WEREDOROTHEAS INWARD SORROWS AS IF HE HAD BEEN WRITING A CHORIC WAIL
 BUTHE WOULD NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF HER HE WOULD WATCH OVER HERIF HE GAVE UPEVERYTHING ELSE IN LIFE HE WOULD WATCH OVER HER AND SHE SHOULD KNOWTHAT SHE HAD ONE SLAVE IN THE WORLD
 WILL HADTO USE SIR THOMASBROWNES PHRASEA PASSIONATE PRODIGALITY OF STATEMENT BOTH TO HIMSELFAND OTHERS
 THE SIMPLE TRUTH WAS THAT NOTHING THEN INVITED HIM SOSTRONGLY AS THE PRESENCE OF DOROTHEA
INVITATIONS OF THE FORMAL KIND HAD BEEN WANTING HOWEVER FOR WILL HADNEVER BEEN ASKED TO GO TO LOWICK
 MR
 BROOKE INDEED CONFIDENT OFDOING EVERYTHING AGREEABLE WHICH CASAUBON POOR FELLOW WAS TOO MUCHABSORBED TO THINK OF HAD ARRANGED TO BRING LADISLAW TO LOWICK SEVERALTIMES NOT NEGLECTING MEANWHILE TO INTRODUCE HIM ELSEWHERE ON EVERYOPPORTUNITY AS A YOUNG RELATIVE OF CASAUBONS
 AND THOUGH WILL HADNOT SEEN DOROTHEA ALONE THEIR INTERVIEWS HAD BEEN ENOUGH TO RESTOREHER FORMER SENSE OF YOUNG COMPANIONSHIP WITH ONE WHO WAS CLEVERER THANHERSELF YET SEEMED READY TO BE SWAYED BY HER
 POOR DOROTHEA BEFORE HERMARRIAGE HAD NEVER FOUND MUCH ROOM IN OTHER MINDS FOR WHAT SHE CAREDMOST TO SAY AND SHE HAD NOT AS WE KNOW ENJOYED HER HUSBANDSSUPERIOR INSTRUCTION SO MUCH AS SHE HAD EXPECTED
 IF SHE SPOKE WITH ANYKEENNESS OF INTEREST TO MR
 CASAUBON HE HEARD HER WITH AN AIR OFPATIENCE AS IF SHE HAD GIVEN A QUOTATION FROM THE DELECTUS FAMILIAR TOHIM FROM HIS TENDER YEARS AND SOMETIMES MENTIONED CURTLY WHAT ANCIENTSECTS OR PERSONAGES HAD HELD SIMILAR IDEAS AS IF THERE WERE TOO MUCHOF THAT SORT IN STOCK ALREADY AT OTHER TIMES HE WOULD INFORM HER THATSHE WAS MISTAKEN AND REASSERT WHAT HER REMARK HAD QUESTIONED
BUT WILL LADISLAW ALWAYS SEEMED TO SEE MORE IN WHAT SHE SAID THAN SHEHERSELF SAW
 DOROTHEA HAD LITTLE VANITY BUT SHE HAD THE ARDENT WOMANSNEED TO RULE BENEFICENTLY BY MAKING THE JOY OF ANOTHER SOUL
 HENCE THEMERE CHANCE OF SEEING WILL OCCASIONALLY WAS LIKE A LUNETTE OPENED INTHE WALL OF HER PRISON GIVING HER A GLIMPSE OF THE SUNNY AIR AND THISPLEASURE BEGAN TO NULLIFY HER ORIGINAL ALARM AT WHAT HER HUSBAND MIGHTTHINK ABOUT THE INTRODUCTION OF WILL AS HER UNCLES GUEST
 ON THISSUBJECT MR
 CASAUBON HAD REMAINED DUMB
BUT WILL WANTED TO TALK WITH DOROTHEA ALONE AND WAS IMPATIENT OF SLOWCIRCUMSTANCE
 HOWEVER SLIGHT THE TERRESTRIAL INTERCOURSE BETWEEN DANTEAND BEATRICE OR PETRARCH AND LAURA TIME CHANGES THE PROPORTION OFTHINGS AND IN LATER DAYS IT IS PREFERABLE TO HAVE FEWER SONNETS ANDMORE CONVERSATION
 NECESSITY EXCUSED STRATAGEM BUT STRATAGEM WASLIMITED BY THE DREAD OF OFFENDING DOROTHEA
 HE FOUND OUT AT LAST THATHE WANTED TO TAKE A PARTICULAR SKETCH AT LOWICK AND ONE MORNING WHENMR
 BROOKE HAD TO DRIVE ALONG THE LOWICK ROAD ON HIS WAY TO THE COUNTYTOWN WILL ASKED TO BE SET DOWN WITH HIS SKETCHBOOK AND CAMPSTOOL ATLOWICK AND WITHOUT ANNOUNCING HIMSELF AT THE MANOR SETTLED HIMSELF TOSKETCH IN A POSITION WHERE HE MUST SEE DOROTHEA IF SHE CAME OUT TOWALKAND HE KNEW THAT SHE USUALLY WALKED AN HOUR IN THE MORNING
BUT THE STRATAGEM WAS DEFEATED BY THE WEATHER
 CLOUDS GATHERED WITHTREACHEROUS QUICKNESS THE RAIN CAME DOWN AND WILL WAS OBLIGED TO TAKESHELTER IN THE HOUSE
 HE INTENDED ON THE STRENGTH OF RELATIONSHIP TOGO INTO THE DRAWINGROOM AND WAIT THERE WITHOUT BEING ANNOUNCED ANDSEEING HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCE THE BUTLER IN THE HALL HE SAID DONTMENTION THAT I AM HERE PRATT I WILL WAIT TILL LUNCHEON I KNOW MR
CASAUBON DOES NOT LIKE TO BE DISTURBED WHEN HE IS IN THE LIBRARY
MASTER IS OUT SIR THERES ONLY MRS
 CASAUBON IN THE LIBRARY
 IDBETTER TELL HER YOURE HERE SIR SAID PRATT A REDCHEEKED MAN GIVENTO LIVELY CONVERSE WITH TANTRIPP AND OFTEN AGREEING WITH HER THAT ITMUST BE DULL FOR MADAM
OH VERY WELL THIS CONFOUNDED RAIN HAS HINDERED ME FROM SKETCHINGSAID WILL FEELING SO HAPPY THAT HE AFFECTED INDIFFERENCE WITHDELIGHTFUL EASE
IN ANOTHER MINUTE HE WAS IN THE LIBRARY AND DOROTHEA WAS MEETING HIMWITH HER SWEET UNCONSTRAINED SMILE
MR
 CASAUBON HAS GONE TO THE ARCHDEACONS SHE SAID AT ONCE
 IDONT KNOW WHETHER HE WILL BE AT HOME AGAIN LONG BEFORE DINNER
 HE WASUNCERTAIN HOW LONG HE SHOULD BE
 DID YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHINGPARTICULAR TO HIM
NO I CAME TO SKETCH BUT THE RAIN DROVE ME IN
 ELSE I WOULD NOT HAVEDISTURBED YOU YET
 I SUPPOSED THAT MR
 CASAUBON WAS HERE AND I KNOW HEDISLIKES INTERRUPTION AT THIS HOUR
I AM INDEBTED TO THE RAIN THEN
 I AM SO GLAD TO SEE YOU
 DOROTHEAUTTERED THESE COMMON WORDS WITH THE SIMPLE SINCERITY OF AN UNHAPPYCHILD VISITED AT SCHOOL
I REALLY CAME FOR THE CHANCE OF SEEING YOU ALONE SAID WILLMYSTERIOUSLY FORCED TO BE JUST AS SIMPLE AS SHE WAS
 HE COULD NOT STAYTO ASK HIMSELF WHY NOT
 I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THINGS AS WE DID INROME
 IT ALWAYS MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE PRESENT
YES SAID DOROTHEA IN HER CLEAR FULL TONE OF ASSENT
 SIT DOWN
 SHESEATED HERSELF ON A DARK OTTOMAN WITH THE BROWN BOOKS BEHIND HERLOOKING IN HER PLAIN DRESS OF SOME THIN WOOLLENWHITE MATERIAL WITHOUTA SINGLE ORNAMENT ON HER BESIDES HER WEDDINGRING AS IF SHE WERE UNDERA VOW TO BE DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER WOMEN AND WILL SAT DOWN OPPOSITEHER AT TWO YARDS DISTANCE THE LIGHT FALLING ON HIS BRIGHT CURLS ANDDELICATE BUT RATHER PETULANT PROFILE WITH ITS DEFIANT CURVES OF LIPAND CHIN
 EACH LOOKED AT THE OTHER AS IF THEY HAD BEEN TWO FLOWERSWHICH HAD OPENED THEN AND THERE
 DOROTHEA FOR THE MOMENT FORGOT HERHUSBANDS MYSTERIOUS IRRITATION AGAINST WILL IT SEEMED FRESH WATER ATHER THIRSTY LIPS TO SPEAK WITHOUT FEAR TO THE ONE PERSON WHOM SHE HADFOUND RECEPTIVE FOR IN LOOKING BACKWARD THROUGH SADNESS SHEEXAGGERATED A PAST SOLACE
I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU AGAIN SHESAID IMMEDIATELY
 IT SEEMS STRANGE TO ME HOW MANY THINGS I SAID TOYOU
I REMEMBER THEM ALL SAID WILL WITH THE UNSPEAKABLE CONTENT IN HISSOUL OF FEELING THAT HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF A CREATURE WORTHY TO BEPERFECTLY LOVED
 I THINK HIS OWN FEELINGS AT THAT MOMENT WERE PERFECTFOR WE MORTALS HAVE OUR DIVINE MOMENTS WHEN LOVE IS SATISFIED IN THECOMPLETENESS OF THE BELOVED OBJECT
I HAVE TRIED TO LEARN A GREAT DEAL SINCE WE WERE IN ROME SAIDDOROTHEA
 I CAN READ LATIN A LITTLE AND I AM BEGINNING TO UNDERSTANDJUST A LITTLE GREEK
 I CAN HELP MR
 CASAUBON BETTER NOW
 I CAN FIND OUTREFERENCES FOR HIM AND SAVE HIS EYES IN MANY WAYS
 BUT IT IS VERYDIFFICULT TO BE LEARNED IT SEEMS AS IF PEOPLE WERE WORN OUT ON THE WAYTO GREAT THOUGHTS AND CAN NEVER ENJOY THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE TOOTIRED
IF A MAN HAS A CAPACITY FOR GREAT THOUGHTS HE IS LIKELY TO OVERTAKETHEM BEFORE HE IS DECREPIT SAID WILL WITH IRREPRESSIBLE QUICKNESS
BUT THROUGH CERTAIN SENSIBILITIES DOROTHEA WAS AS QUICK AS HE ANDSEEING HER FACE CHANGE HE ADDED IMMEDIATELY BUT IT IS QUITE TRUETHAT THE BEST MINDS HAVE BEEN SOMETIMES OVERSTRAINED IN WORKING OUTTHEIR IDEAS
YOU CORRECT ME SAID DOROTHEA
 I EXPRESSED MYSELF ILL
 I SHOULD HAVESAID THAT THOSE WHO HAVE GREAT THOUGHTS GET TOO MUCH WORN IN WORKINGTHEM OUT
 I USED TO FEEL ABOUT THAT EVEN WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL ANDIT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THAT THE USE I SHOULD LIKE TO MAKE OF MY LIFEWOULD BE TO HELP SOME ONE WHO DID GREAT WORKS SO THAT HIS BURTHENMIGHT BE LIGHTER
DOROTHEA WAS LED ON TO THIS BIT OF AUTOBIOGRAPHY WITHOUT ANY SENSE OFMAKING A REVELATION
 BUT SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE SAID ANYTHING TO WILLWHICH THREW SO STRONG A LIGHT ON HER MARRIAGE
 HE DID NOT SHRUG HISSHOULDERS AND FOR WANT OF THAT MUSCULAR OUTLET HE THOUGHT THE MOREIRRITABLY OF BEAUTIFUL LIPS KISSING HOLY SKULLS AND OTHER EMPTINESSESECCLESIASTICALLY ENSHRINED
 ALSO HE HAD TO TAKE CARE THAT HIS SPEECHSHOULD NOT BETRAY THAT THOUGHT
BUT YOU MAY EASILY CARRY THE HELP TOO FAR HE SAID AND GETOVERWROUGHT YOURSELF
 ARE YOU NOT TOO MUCH SHUT UP
 YOU ALREADY LOOKPALER
 IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR MR
 CASAUBON TO HAVE A SECRETARY HECOULD EASILY GET A MAN WHO WOULD DO HALF HIS WORK FOR HIM
 IT WOULDSAVE HIM MORE EFFECTUALLY AND YOU NEED ONLY HELP HIM IN LIGHTER WAYS
HOW CAN YOU THINK OF THAT
 SAID DOROTHEA IN A TONE OF EARNESTREMONSTRANCE
 I SHOULD HAVE NO HAPPINESS IF I DID NOT HELP HIM IN HISWORK
 WHAT COULD I DO
 THERE IS NO GOOD TO BE DONE IN LOWICK
 THE ONLYTHING I DESIRE IS TO HELP HIM MORE
 AND HE OBJECTS TO A SECRETARYPLEASE NOT TO MENTION THAT AGAIN
CERTAINLY NOT NOW I KNOW YOUR FEELING
 BUT I HAVE HEARD BOTH MR
BROOKE AND SIR JAMES CHETTAM EXPRESS THE SAME WISH
YES SAID DOROTHEA BUT THEY DONT UNDERSTANDTHEY WANT ME TO BE AGREAT DEAL ON HORSEBACK AND HAVE THE GARDEN ALTERED AND NEWCONSERVATORIES TO FILL UP MY DAYS
 I THOUGHT YOU COULD UNDERSTAND THATONES MIND HAS OTHER WANTS SHE ADDED RATHER IMPATIENTLYBESIDESMR
 CASAUBON CANNOT BEAR TO HEAR OF A SECRETARY
MY MISTAKE IS EXCUSABLE SAID WILL
 IN OLD DAYS I USED TO HEAR MR
CASAUBON SPEAK AS IF HE LOOKED FORWARD TO HAVING A SECRETARY
 INDEED HEHELD OUT THE PROSPECT OF THAT OFFICE TO ME
 BUT I TURNED OUT TO BENOTGOOD ENOUGH FOR IT
DOROTHEA WAS TRYING TO EXTRACT OUT OF THIS AN EXCUSE FOR HER HUSBANDSEVIDENT REPULSION AS SHE SAID WITH A PLAYFUL SMILE YOU WERE NOT ASTEADY WORKER ENOUGH
NO SAID WILL SHAKING HIS HEAD BACKWARD SOMEWHAT AFTER THE MANNER OFA SPIRITED HORSE
 AND THEN THE OLD IRRITABLE DEMON PROMPTING HIM TOGIVE ANOTHER GOOD PINCH AT THE MOTHWINGS OF POOR MR
 CASAUBONS GLORYHE WENT ON AND I HAVE SEEN SINCE THAT MR
 CASAUBON DOES NOT LIKE ANYONE TO OVERLOOK HIS WORK AND KNOW THOROUGHLY WHAT HE IS DOING
 HE ISTOO DOUBTFULTOO UNCERTAIN OF HIMSELF
 I MAY NOT BE GOOD FOR MUCH BUTHE DISLIKES ME BECAUSE I DISAGREE WITH HIM
WILL WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS INTENTIONS TO BE ALWAYS GENEROUS BUT OURTONGUES ARE LITTLE TRIGGERS WHICH HAVE USUALLY BEEN PULLED BEFOREGENERAL INTENTIONS CAN BE BROUGHT TO BEAR
 AND IT WAS TOO INTOLERABLETHAT CASAUBONS DISLIKE OF HIM SHOULD NOT BE FAIRLY ACCOUNTED FOR TODOROTHEA
 YET WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN HE WAS RATHER UNEASY AS TO THE EFFECTON HER
BUT DOROTHEA WAS STRANGELY QUIETNOT IMMEDIATELY INDIGNANT AS SHE HADBEEN ON A LIKE OCCASION IN ROME
 AND THE CAUSE LAY DEEP
 SHE WAS NOLONGER STRUGGLING AGAINST THE PERCEPTION OF FACTS BUT ADJUSTINGHERSELF TO THEIR CLEAREST PERCEPTION AND NOW WHEN SHE LOOKED STEADILYAT HER HUSBANDS FAILURE STILL MORE AT HIS POSSIBLE CONSCIOUSNESS OFFAILURE SHE SEEMED TO BE LOOKING ALONG THE ONE TRACK WHERE DUTY BECAMETENDERNESS
 WILLS WANT OF RETICENCE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MET WITH MORESEVERITY IF HE HAD NOT ALREADY BEEN RECOMMENDED TO HER MERCY BY HERHUSBANDS DISLIKE WHICH MUST SEEM HARD TO HER TILL SHE SAW BETTERREASON FOR IT
SHE DID NOT ANSWER AT ONCE BUT AFTER LOOKING DOWN RUMINATINGLY SHESAID WITH SOME EARNESTNESS MR
 CASAUBON MUST HAVE OVERCOME HISDISLIKE OF YOU SO FAR AS HIS ACTIONS WERE CONCERNED AND THAT ISADMIRABLE
YES HE HAS SHOWN A SENSE OF JUSTICE IN FAMILY MATTERS
 IT WAS ANABOMINABLE THING THAT MY GRANDMOTHER SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISINHERITEDBECAUSE SHE MADE WHAT THEY CALLED A MESALLIANCE THOUGH THERE WASNOTHING TO BE SAID AGAINST HER HUSBAND EXCEPT THAT HE WAS A POLISHREFUGEE WHO GAVE LESSONS FOR HIS BREAD
I WISH I KNEW ALL ABOUT HER
 SAID DOROTHEA
 I WONDER HOW SHE BORETHE CHANGE FROM WEALTH TO POVERTY I WONDER WHETHER SHE WAS HAPPY WITHHER HUSBAND
 DO YOU KNOW MUCH ABOUT THEM
NO ONLY THAT MY GRANDFATHER WAS A PATRIOTA BRIGHT FELLOWCOULD SPEAKMANY LANGUAGESMUSICALGOT HIS BREAD BY TEACHING ALL SORTS OF THINGS
THEY BOTH DIED RATHER EARLY
 AND I NEVER KNEW MUCH OF MY FATHER BEYONDWHAT MY MOTHER TOLD ME BUT HE INHERITED THE MUSICAL TALENTS
 IREMEMBER HIS SLOW WALK AND HIS LONG THIN HANDS AND ONE DAY REMAINSWITH ME WHEN HE WAS LYING ILL AND I WAS VERY HUNGRY AND HAD ONLY ALITTLE BIT OF BREAD
AH WHAT A DIFFERENT LIFE FROM MINE
 SAID DOROTHEA WITH KEENINTEREST CLASPING HER HANDS ON HER LAP
 I HAVE ALWAYS HAD TOO MUCH OFEVERYTHING
 BUT TELL ME HOW IT WASMR
 CASAUBON COULD NOT HAVE KNOWNABOUT YOU THEN
NO BUT MY FATHER HAD MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO MR
 CASAUBON AND THAT WASMY LAST HUNGRY DAY
 MY FATHER DIED SOON AFTER AND MY MOTHER AND I WEREWELL TAKEN CARE OF
 MR
 CASAUBON ALWAYS EXPRESSLY RECOGNIZED IT AS HISDUTY TO TAKE CARE OF US BECAUSE OF THE HARSH INJUSTICE WHICH HAD BEENSHOWN TO HIS MOTHERS SISTER
 BUT NOW I AM TELLING YOU WHAT IS NOT NEWTO YOU
IN HIS INMOST SOUL WILL WAS CONSCIOUS OF WISHING TO TELL DOROTHEA WHATWAS RATHER NEW EVEN IN HIS OWN CONSTRUCTION OF THINGSNAMELY THAT MR
CASAUBON HAD NEVER DONE MORE THAN PAY A DEBT TOWARDS HIM
 WILL WAS MUCHTOO GOOD A FELLOW TO BE EASY UNDER THE SENSE OF BEING UNGRATEFUL
 ANDWHEN GRATITUDE HAS BECOME A MATTER OF REASONING THERE ARE MANY WAYS OFESCAPING FROM ITS BONDS
NO ANSWERED DOROTHEA MR
 CASAUBON HAS ALWAYS AVOIDED DWELLING ONHIS OWN HONORABLE ACTIONS
 SHE DID NOT FEEL THAT HER HUSBANDS CONDUCTWAS DEPRECIATED BUT THIS NOTION OF WHAT JUSTICE HAD REQUIRED IN HISRELATIONS WITH WILL LADISLAW TOOK STRONG HOLD ON HER MIND
 AFTER AMOMENTS PAUSE SHE ADDED HE HAD NEVER TOLD ME THAT HE SUPPORTED YOURMOTHER
 IS SHE STILL LIVING
NO SHE DIED BY AN ACCIDENTA FALLFOUR YEARS AGO
 IT IS CURIOUS THATMY MOTHER TOO RAN AWAY FROM HER FAMILY BUT NOT FOR THE SAKE OF HERHUSBAND
 SHE NEVER WOULD TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT HER FAMILY EXCEPT THATSHE FORSOOK THEM TO GET HER OWN LIVINGWENT ON THE STAGE IN FACT
 SHEWAS A DARKEYED CREATURE WITH CRISP RINGLETS AND NEVER SEEMED TO BEGETTING OLD
 YOU SEE I COME OF REBELLIOUS BLOOD ON BOTH SIDES WILLENDED SMILING BRIGHTLY AT DOROTHEA WHILE SHE WAS STILL LOOKING WITHSERIOUS INTENTNESS BEFORE HER LIKE A CHILD SEEING A DRAMA FOR THEFIRST TIME
BUT HER FACE TOO BROKE INTO A SMILE AS SHE SAID THAT IS YOURAPOLOGY I SUPPOSE FOR HAVING YOURSELF BEEN RATHER REBELLIOUS I MEANTO MR
 CASAUBONS WISHES
 YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE NOT DONE WHATHE THOUGHT BEST FOR YOU
 AND IF HE DISLIKES YOUYOU WERE SPEAKING OFDISLIKE A LITTLE WHILE AGOBUT I SHOULD RATHER SAY IF HE HAS SHOWN ANYPAINFUL FEELINGS TOWARDS YOU YOU MUST CONSIDER HOW SENSITIVE HE HASBECOME FROM THE WEARING EFFECT OF STUDY
 PERHAPS SHE CONTINUEDGETTING INTO A PLEADING TONE MY UNCLE HAS NOT TOLD YOU HOW SERIOUSMR
 CASAUBONS ILLNESS WAS
 IT WOULD BE VERY PETTY OF US WHO ARE WELLAND CAN BEAR THINGS TO THINK MUCH OF SMALL OFFENCES FROM THOSE WHOCARRY A WEIGHT OF TRIAL
YOU TEACH ME BETTER SAID WILL
 I WILL NEVER GRUMBLE ON THAT SUBJECTAGAIN
 THERE WAS A GENTLENESS IN HIS TONE WHICH CAME FROM THEUNUTTERABLE CONTENTMENT OF PERCEIVINGWHAT DOROTHEA WAS HARDLYCONSCIOUS OFTHAT SHE WAS TRAVELLING INTO THE REMOTENESS OF PURE PITYAND LOYALTY TOWARDS HER HUSBAND
 WILL WAS READY TO ADORE HER PITY ANDLOYALTY IF SHE WOULD ASSOCIATE HIMSELF WITH HER IN MANIFESTING THEM
I HAVE REALLY SOMETIMES BEEN A PERVERSE FELLOW HE WENT ON BUT IWILL NEVER AGAIN IF I CAN HELP IT DO OR SAY WHAT YOU WOULDDISAPPROVE
THAT IS VERY GOOD OF YOU SAID DOROTHEA WITH ANOTHER OPEN SMILE
 ISHALL HAVE A LITTLE KINGDOM THEN WHERE I SHALL GIVE LAWS
 BUT YOU WILLSOON GO AWAY OUT OF MY RULE I IMAGINE
 YOU WILL SOON BE TIRED OFSTAYING AT THE GRANGE
THAT IS A POINT I WANTED TO MENTION TO YOUONE OF THE REASONS WHY IWISHED TO SPEAK TO YOU ALONE
 MR
 BROOKE PROPOSES THAT I SHOULD STAY INTHIS NEIGHBORHOOD
 HE HAS BOUGHT ONE OF THE MIDDLEMARCH NEWSPAPERS ANDHE WISHES ME TO CONDUCT THAT AND ALSO TO HELP HIM IN OTHER WAYS
WOULD NOT THAT BE A SACRIFICE OF HIGHER PROSPECTS FOR YOU
 SAIDDOROTHEA
PERHAPS BUT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN BLAMED FOR THINKING OF PROSPECTS ANDNOT SETTLING TO ANYTHING
 AND HERE IS SOMETHING OFFERED TO ME
 IF YOUWOULD NOT LIKE ME TO ACCEPT IT I WILL GIVE IT UP
 OTHERWISE I WOULDRATHER STAY IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY THAN GO AWAY
 I BELONG TONOBODY ANYWHERE ELSE
I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO STAY VERY MUCH SAID DOROTHEA AT ONCE ASSIMPLY AND READILY AS SHE HAD SPOKEN AT ROME
 THERE WAS NOT THE SHADOWOF A REASON IN HER MIND AT THE MOMENT WHY SHE SHOULD NOT SAY SO
THEN I WILL STAY SAID LADISLAW SHAKING HIS HEAD BACKWARD RISINGAND GOING TOWARDS THE WINDOW AS IF TO SEE WHETHER THE RAIN HAD CEASED
BUT THE NEXT MOMENT DOROTHEA ACCORDING TO A HABIT WHICH WAS GETTINGCONTINUALLY STRONGER BEGAN TO REFLECT THAT HER HUSBAND FELTDIFFERENTLY FROM HERSELF AND SHE COLORED DEEPLY UNDER THE DOUBLEEMBARRASSMENT OF HAVING EXPRESSED WHAT MIGHT BE IN OPPOSITION TO HERHUSBANDS FEELING AND OF HAVING TO SUGGEST THIS OPPOSITION TO WILL
HIS FACE WAS NOT TURNED TOWARDS HER AND THIS MADE IT EASIER TO SAYBUT MY OPINION IS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE ON SUCH A SUBJECT
 I THINK YOUSHOULD BE GUIDED BY MR
 CASAUBON
 I SPOKE WITHOUT THINKING OF ANYTHINGELSE THAN MY OWN FEELING WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REALQUESTION
 BUT IT NOW OCCURS TO MEPERHAPS MR
 CASAUBON MIGHT SEE THATTHE PROPOSAL WAS NOT WISE
 CAN YOU NOT WAIT NOW AND MENTION IT TO HIM
I CANT WAIT TODAY SAID WILL INWARDLY SEARED BY THE POSSIBILITYTHAT MR
 CASAUBON WOULD ENTER
 THE RAIN IS QUITE OVER NOW
 I TOLD MR
BROOKE NOT TO CALL FOR ME I WOULD RATHER WALK THE FIVE MILES
 I SHALLSTRIKE ACROSS HALSELL COMMON AND SEE THE GLEAMS ON THE WET GRASS
 ILIKE THAT
HE APPROACHED HER TO SHAKE HANDS QUITE HURRIEDLY LONGING BUT NOTDARING TO SAY DONT MENTION THE SUBJECT TO MR
 CASAUBON
 NO HEDARED NOT COULD NOT SAY IT
 TO ASK HER TO BE LESS SIMPLE AND DIRECTWOULD BE LIKE BREATHING ON THE CRYSTAL THAT YOU WANT TO SEE THE LIGHTTHROUGH
 AND THERE WAS ALWAYS THE OTHER GREAT DREADOF HIMSELF BECOMINGDIMMED AND FOREVER RAYSHORN IN HER EYES
I WISH YOU COULD HAVE STAYED SAID DOROTHEA WITH A TOUCH OFMOURNFULNESS AS SHE ROSE AND PUT OUT HER HAND
 SHE ALSO HAD HERTHOUGHT WHICH SHE DID NOT LIKE TO EXPRESSWILL CERTAINLY OUGHT TO LOSENO TIME IN CONSULTING MR
 CASAUBONS WISHES BUT FOR HER TO URGE THISMIGHT SEEM AN UNDUE DICTATION
SO THEY ONLY SAID GOODBY AND WILL QUITTED THE HOUSE STRIKINGACROSS THE FIELDS SO AS NOT TO RUN ANY RISK OF ENCOUNTERING MR
CASAUBONS CARRIAGE WHICH HOWEVER DID NOT APPEAR AT THE GATE UNTILFOUR OCLOCK
 THAT WAS AN UNPROPITIOUS HOUR FOR COMING HOME IT WAS TOOEARLY TO GAIN THE MORAL SUPPORT UNDER ENNUI OF DRESSING HIS PERSON FORDINNER AND TOO LATE TO UNDRESS HIS MIND OF THE DAYS FRIVOLOUSCEREMONY AND AFFAIRS SO AS TO BE PREPARED FOR A GOOD PLUNGE INTO THESERIOUS BUSINESS OF STUDY
 ON SUCH OCCASIONS HE USUALLY THREW INTO ANEASYCHAIR IN THE LIBRARY AND ALLOWED DOROTHEA TO READ THE LONDONPAPERS TO HIM CLOSING HIS EYES THE WHILE
 TODAY HOWEVER HE DECLINEDTHAT RELIEF OBSERVING THAT HE HAD ALREADY HAD TOO MANY PUBLIC DETAILSURGED UPON HIM BUT HE SPOKE MORE CHEERFULLY THAN USUAL WHEN DOROTHEAASKED ABOUT HIS FATIGUE AND ADDED WITH THAT AIR OF FORMAL EFFORT WHICHNEVER FORSOOK HIM EVEN WHEN HE SPOKE WITHOUT HIS WAISTCOAT AND CRAVATI HAVE HAD THE GRATIFICATION OF MEETING MY FORMER ACQUAINTANCE DR
SPANNING TODAY AND OF BEING PRAISED BY ONE WHO IS HIMSELF A WORTHYRECIPIENT OF PRAISE
 HE SPOKE VERY HANDSOMELY OF MY LATE TRACTATE ONTHE EGYPTIAN MYSTERIESUSING IN FACT TERMS WHICH IT WOULD NOT BECOMEME TO REPEAT
 IN UTTERING THE LAST CLAUSE MR
 CASAUBON LEANED OVERTHE ELBOW OF HIS CHAIR AND SWAYED HIS HEAD UP AND DOWN APPARENTLY ASA MUSCULAR OUTLET INSTEAD OF THAT RECAPITULATION WHICH WOULD NOT HAVEBEEN BECOMING
I AM VERY GLAD YOU HAVE HAD THAT PLEASURE SAID DOROTHEA DELIGHTEDTO SEE HER HUSBAND LESS WEARY THAN USUAL AT THIS HOUR
 BEFORE YOU CAMEI HAD BEEN REGRETTING THAT YOU HAPPENED TO BE OUT TODAY
WHY SO MY DEAR
 SAID MR
 CASAUBON THROWING HIMSELF BACKWARD AGAIN
BECAUSE MR
 LADISLAW HAS BEEN HERE AND HE HAS MENTIONED A PROPOSAL OFMY UNCLES WHICH I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR OPINION OF
 HER HUSBANDSHE FELT WAS REALLY CONCERNED IN THIS QUESTION
 EVEN WITH HER IGNORANCEOF THE WORLD SHE HAD A VAGUE IMPRESSION THAT THE POSITION OFFERED TOWILL WAS OUT OF KEEPING WITH HIS FAMILY CONNECTIONS AND CERTAINLY MR
CASAUBON HAD A CLAIM TO BE CONSULTED
 HE DID NOT SPEAK BUT MERELYBOWED
DEAR UNCLE YOU KNOW HAS MANY PROJECTS
 IT APPEARS THAT HE HAS BOUGHTONE OF THE MIDDLEMARCH NEWSPAPERS AND HE HAS ASKED MR
 LADISLAW TOSTAY IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND CONDUCT THE PAPER FOR HIM BESIDESHELPING HIM IN OTHER WAYS
DOROTHEA LOOKED AT HER HUSBAND WHILE SHE SPOKE BUT HE HAD AT FIRSTBLINKED AND FINALLY CLOSED HIS EYES AS IF TO SAVE THEM WHILE HIS LIPSBECAME MORE TENSE
 WHAT IS YOUR OPINION
 SHE ADDED RATHER TIMIDLYAFTER A SLIGHT PAUSE
DID MR
 LADISLAW COME ON PURPOSE TO ASK MY OPINION
 SAID MR
CASAUBON OPENING HIS EYES NARROWLY WITH A KNIFEEDGED LOOK ATDOROTHEA
 SHE WAS REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE ON THE POINT HE INQUIRED ABOUTBUT SHE ONLY BECAME A LITTLE MORE SERIOUS AND HER EYES DID NOT SWERVE
NO SHE ANSWERED IMMEDIATELY HE DID NOT SAY THAT HE CAME TO ASKYOUR OPINION
 BUT WHEN HE MENTIONED THE PROPOSAL HE OF COURSE EXPECTEDME TO TELL YOU OF IT
MR
 CASAUBON WAS SILENT
I FEARED THAT YOU MIGHT FEEL SOME OBJECTION
 BUT CERTAINLY A YOUNG MANWITH SO MUCH TALENT MIGHT BE VERY USEFUL TO MY UNCLEMIGHT HELP HIM TODO GOOD IN A BETTER WAY
 AND MR
 LADISLAW WISHES TO HAVE SOME FIXEDOCCUPATION
 HE HAS BEEN BLAMED HE SAYS FOR NOT SEEKING SOMETHING OFTHAT KIND AND HE WOULD LIKE TO STAY IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE NOONE CARES FOR HIM ELSEWHERE
DOROTHEA FELT THAT THIS WAS A CONSIDERATION TO SOFTEN HER HUSBAND
HOWEVER HE DID NOT SPEAK AND SHE PRESENTLY RECURRED TO DR
 SPANNINGAND THE ARCHDEACONS BREAKFAST
 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER SUNSHINE ONTHESE SUBJECTS
THE NEXT MORNING WITHOUT DOROTHEAS KNOWLEDGE MR
 CASAUBON DESPATCHEDTHE FOLLOWING LETTER BEGINNING DEAR MR
 LADISLAW HE HAD ALWAYSBEFORE ADDRESSED HIM AS WILLMRS
 CASAUBON INFORMS ME THAT A PROPOSAL HAS BEEN MADE TO YOU ANDACCORDING TO AN INFERENCE BY NO MEANS STRETCHED HAS ON YOUR PART BEENIN SOME DEGREE ENTERTAINED WHICH INVOLVES YOUR RESIDENCE IN THISNEIGHBORHOOD IN A CAPACITY WHICH I AM JUSTIFIED IN SAYING TOUCHES MYOWN POSITION IN SUCH A WAY AS RENDERS IT NOT ONLY NATURAL ANDWARRANTABLE IN ME WHEN THAT EFFECT IS VIEWED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OFLEGITIMATE FEELING BUT INCUMBENT ON ME WHEN THE SAME EFFECT ISCONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF MY RESPONSIBILITIES TO STATE AT ONCE THATYOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE PROPOSAL ABOVE INDICATED WOULD BE HIGHLYOFFENSIVE TO ME
 THAT I HAVE SOME CLAIM TO THE EXERCISE OF A VETO HEREWOULD NOT I BELIEVE BE DENIED BY ANY REASONABLE PERSON COGNIZANT OFTHE RELATIONS BETWEEN US RELATIONS WHICH THOUGH THROWN INTO THE PASTBY YOUR RECENT PROCEDURE ARE NOT THEREBY ANNULLED IN THEIR CHARACTEROF DETERMINING ANTECEDENTS
 I WILL NOT HERE MAKE REFLECTIONS ON ANYPERSONS JUDGMENT
 IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO POINT OUT TO YOURSELF THATTHERE ARE CERTAIN SOCIAL FITNESSES AND PROPRIETIES WHICH SHOULD HINDERA SOMEWHAT NEAR RELATIVE OF MINE FROM BECOMING ANY WISE CONSPICUOUS INTHIS VICINITY IN A STATUS NOT ONLY MUCH BENEATH MY OWN BUT ASSOCIATEDAT BEST WITH THE SCIOLISM OF LITERARY OR POLITICAL ADVENTURERS
 AT ANYRATE THE CONTRARY ISSUE MUST EXCLUDE YOU FROM FURTHER RECEPTION AT MYHOUSE
YOURS FAITHFULLYEDWARD CASAUBON
MEANWHILE DOROTHEAS MIND WAS INNOCENTLY AT WORK TOWARDS THE FURTHEREMBITTERMENT OF HER HUSBAND DWELLING WITH A SYMPATHY THAT GREW TOAGITATION ON WHAT WILL HAD TOLD HER ABOUT HIS PARENTS ANDGRANDPARENTS
 ANY PRIVATE HOURS IN HER DAY WERE USUALLY SPENT IN HERBLUEGREEN BOUDOIR AND SHE HAD COME TO BE VERY FOND OF ITS PALLIDQUAINTNESS
 NOTHING HAD BEEN OUTWARDLY ALTERED THERE BUT WHILE THESUMMER HAD GRADUALLY ADVANCED OVER THE WESTERN FIELDS BEYOND THE AVENUEOF ELMS THE BARE ROOM HAD GATHERED WITHIN IT THOSE MEMORIES OF ANINWARD LIFE WHICH FILL THE AIR AS WITH A CLOUD OF GOOD OR BAD ANGELSTHE INVISIBLE YET ACTIVE FORMS OF OUR SPIRITUAL TRIUMPHS OR OURSPIRITUAL FALLS
 SHE HAD BEEN SO USED TO STRUGGLE FOR AND TO FINDRESOLVE IN LOOKING ALONG THE AVENUE TOWARDS THE ARCH OF WESTERN LIGHTTHAT THE VISION ITSELF HAD GAINED A COMMUNICATING POWER
 EVEN THE PALESTAG SEEMED TO HAVE REMINDING GLANCES AND TO MEAN MUTELY YES WEKNOW
 AND THE GROUP OF DELICATELY TOUCHED MINIATURES HAD MADE ANAUDIENCE AS OF BEINGS NO LONGER DISTURBED ABOUT THEIR OWN EARTHLY LOTBUT STILL HUMANLY INTERESTED
 ESPECIALLY THE MYSTERIOUS AUNT JULIAABOUT WHOM DOROTHEA HAD NEVER FOUND IT EASY TO QUESTION HER HUSBAND
AND NOW SINCE HER CONVERSATION WITH WILL MANY FRESH IMAGES HADGATHERED ROUND THAT AUNT JULIA WHO WAS WILLS GRANDMOTHER THE PRESENCEOF THAT DELICATE MINIATURE SO LIKE A LIVING FACE THAT SHE KNEWHELPING TO CONCENTRATE HER FEELINGS
 WHAT A WRONG TO CUT OFF THE GIRLFROM THE FAMILY PROTECTION AND INHERITANCE ONLY BECAUSE SHE HAD CHOSENA MAN WHO WAS POOR
 DOROTHEA EARLY TROUBLING HER ELDERS WITH QUESTIONSABOUT THE FACTS AROUND HER HAD WROUGHT HERSELF INTO SOME INDEPENDENTCLEARNESS AS TO THE HISTORICAL POLITICAL REASONS WHY ELDEST SONS HADSUPERIOR RIGHTS AND WHY LAND SHOULD BE ENTAILED THOSE REASONSIMPRESSING HER WITH A CERTAIN AWE MIGHT BE WEIGHTIER THAN SHE KNEWBUT HERE WAS A QUESTION OF TIES WHICH LEFT THEM UNINFRINGED
 HERE WAS ADAUGHTER WHOSE CHILDEVEN ACCORDING TO THE ORDINARY APING OFARISTOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS BY PEOPLE WHO ARE NO MORE ARISTOCRATIC THANRETIRED GROCERS AND WHO HAVE NO MORE LAND TO KEEP TOGETHER THAN ALAWN AND A PADDOCKWOULD HAVE A PRIOR CLAIM
 WAS INHERITANCE A QUESTIONOF LIKING OR OF RESPONSIBILITY
 ALL THE ENERGY OF DOROTHEAS NATUREWENT ON THE SIDE OF RESPONSIBILITYTHE FULFILMENT OF CLAIMS FOUNDED ONOUR OWN DEEDS SUCH AS MARRIAGE AND PARENTAGE
IT WAS TRUE SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT MR
 CASAUBON HAD A DEBT TO THELADISLAWSTHAT HE HAD TO PAY BACK WHAT THE LADISLAWS HAD BEEN WRONGEDOF
 AND NOW SHE BEGAN TO THINK OF HER HUSBANDS WILL WHICH HAD BEENMADE AT THE TIME OF THEIR MARRIAGE LEAVING THE BULK OF HIS PROPERTY TOHER WITH PROVISO IN CASE OF HER HAVING CHILDREN
 THAT OUGHT TO BEALTERED AND NO TIME OUGHT TO BE LOST
 THIS VERY QUESTION WHICH HADJUST ARISEN ABOUT WILL LADISLAWS OCCUPATION WAS THE OCCASION FORPLACING THINGS ON A NEW RIGHT FOOTING
 HER HUSBAND SHE FELT SUREACCORDING TO ALL HIS PREVIOUS CONDUCT WOULD BE READY TO TAKE THE JUSTVIEW IF SHE PROPOSED ITSHE IN WHOSE INTEREST AN UNFAIR CONCENTRATIONOF THE PROPERTY HAD BEEN URGED
 HIS SENSE OF RIGHT HAD SURMOUNTED ANDWOULD CONTINUE TO SURMOUNT ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE CALLED ANTIPATHY
 SHESUSPECTED THAT HER UNCLES SCHEME WAS DISAPPROVED BY MR
 CASAUBON ANDTHIS MADE IT SEEM ALL THE MORE OPPORTUNE THAT A FRESH UNDERSTANDINGSHOULD BE BEGUN SO THAT INSTEAD OF WILLS STARTING PENNILESS ANDACCEPTING THE FIRST FUNCTION THAT OFFERED ITSELF HE SHOULD FINDHIMSELF IN POSSESSION OF A RIGHTFUL INCOME WHICH SHOULD BE PAID BY HERHUSBAND DURING HIS LIFE AND BY AN IMMEDIATE ALTERATION OF THE WILLSHOULD BE SECURED AT HIS DEATH
 THE VISION OF ALL THIS AS WHAT OUGHT TOBE DONE SEEMED TO DOROTHEA LIKE A SUDDEN LETTING IN OF DAYLIGHT WAKINGHER FROM HER PREVIOUS STUPIDITY AND INCURIOUS SELFABSORBED IGNORANCEABOUT HER HUSBANDS RELATION TO OTHERS
 WILL LADISLAW HAD REFUSED MR
CASAUBONS FUTURE AID ON A GROUND THAT NO LONGER APPEARED RIGHT TO HERAND MR
 CASAUBON HAD NEVER HIMSELF SEEN FULLY WHAT WAS THE CLAIM UPONHIM
 BUT HE WILL
 SAID DOROTHEA
 THE GREAT STRENGTH OF HIS CHARACTERLIES HERE
 AND WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH OUR MONEY
 WE MAKE NO USE OF HALFOF OUR INCOME
 MY OWN MONEY BUYS ME NOTHING BUT AN UNEASY CONSCIENCE
THERE WAS A PECULIAR FASCINATION FOR DOROTHEA IN THIS DIVISION OFPROPERTY INTENDED FOR HERSELF AND ALWAYS REGARDED BY HER AS EXCESSIVE
SHE WAS BLIND YOU SEE TO MANY THINGS OBVIOUS TO OTHERSLIKELY TOTREAD IN THE WRONG PLACES AS CELIA HAD WARNED HER YET HER BLINDNESSTO WHATEVER DID NOT LIE IN HER OWN PURE PURPOSE CARRIED HER SAFELY BYTHE SIDE OF PRECIPICES WHERE VISION WOULD HAVE BEEN PERILOUS WITH FEAR
THE THOUGHTS WHICH HAD GATHERED VIVIDNESS IN THE SOLITUDE OF HERBOUDOIR OCCUPIED HER INCESSANTLY THROUGH THE DAY ON WHICH MR
 CASAUBONHAD SENT HIS LETTER TO WILL
 EVERYTHING SEEMED HINDRANCE TO HER TILLSHE COULD FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF OPENING HER HEART TO HER HUSBAND
 TOHIS PREOCCUPIED MIND ALL SUBJECTS WERE TO BE APPROACHED GENTLY AND SHEHAD NEVER SINCE HIS ILLNESS LOST FROM HER CONSCIOUSNESS THE DREAD OFAGITATING HIM
 BUT WHEN YOUNG ARDOR IS SET BROODING OVER THE CONCEPTIONOF A PROMPT DEED THE DEED ITSELF SEEMS TO START FORTH WITH INDEPENDENTLIFE MASTERING IDEAL OBSTACLES
 THE DAY PASSED IN A SOMBRE FASHIONNOT UNUSUAL THOUGH MR
 CASAUBON WAS PERHAPS UNUSUALLY SILENT BUTTHERE WERE HOURS OF THE NIGHT WHICH MIGHT BE COUNTED ON ASOPPORTUNITIES OF CONVERSATION FOR DOROTHEA WHEN AWARE OF HERHUSBANDS SLEEPLESSNESS HAD ESTABLISHED A HABIT OF RISING LIGHTING ACANDLE AND READING HIM TO SLEEP AGAIN
 AND THIS NIGHT SHE WAS FROM THEBEGINNING SLEEPLESS EXCITED BY RESOLVES
 HE SLEPT AS USUAL FOR A FEWHOURS BUT SHE HAD RISEN SOFTLY AND HAD SAT IN THE DARKNESS FOR NEARLYAN HOUR BEFORE HE SAIDDOROTHEA SINCE YOU ARE UP WILL YOU LIGHT A CANDLE
DO YOU FEEL ILL DEAR
 WAS HER FIRST QUESTION AS SHE OBEYED HIM
NO NOT AT ALL BUT I SHALL BE OBLIGED SINCE YOU ARE UP IF YOU WILLREAD ME A FEW PAGES OF LOWTH
MAY I TALK TO YOU A LITTLE INSTEAD
 SAID DOROTHEA
CERTAINLY
I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT MONEY ALL DAYTHAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD TOOMUCH AND ESPECIALLY THE PROSPECT OF TOO MUCH
THESE MY DEAR DOROTHEA ARE PROVIDENTIAL ARRANGEMENTS
BUT IF ONE HAS TOO MUCH IN CONSEQUENCE OF OTHERS BEING WRONGED ITSEEMS TO ME THAT THE DIVINE VOICE WHICH TELLS US TO SET THAT WRONGRIGHT MUST BE OBEYED
WHAT MY LOVE IS THE BEARING OF YOUR REMARK
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN TOO LIBERAL IN ARRANGEMENTS FOR MEI MEAN WITHREGARD TO PROPERTY AND THAT MAKES ME UNHAPPY
HOW SO
 I HAVE NONE BUT COMPARATIVELY DISTANT CONNECTIONS
I HAVE BEEN LED TO THINK ABOUT YOUR AUNT JULIA AND HOW SHE WAS LEFTIN POVERTY ONLY BECAUSE SHE MARRIED A POOR MAN AN ACT WHICH WAS NOTDISGRACEFUL SINCE HE WAS NOT UNWORTHY
 IT WAS ON THAT GROUND I KNOWTHAT YOU EDUCATED MR
 LADISLAW AND PROVIDED FOR HIS MOTHER
DOROTHEA WAITED A FEW MOMENTS FOR SOME ANSWER THAT WOULD HELP HERONWARD
 NONE CAME AND HER NEXT WORDS SEEMED THE MORE FORCIBLE TO HERFALLING CLEAR UPON THE DARK SILENCE
BUT SURELY WE SHOULD REGARD HIS CLAIM AS A MUCH GREATER ONE EVEN TOTHE HALF OF THAT PROPERTY WHICH I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE DESTINED FOR ME
AND I THINK HE OUGHT AT ONCE TO BE PROVIDED FOR ON THAT UNDERSTANDING
IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT HE SHOULD BE IN THE DEPENDENCE OF POVERTY WHILE WEARE RICH
 AND IF THERE IS ANY OBJECTION TO THE PROPOSAL HE MENTIONEDTHE GIVING HIM HIS TRUE PLACE AND HIS TRUE SHARE WOULD SET ASIDE ANYMOTIVE FOR HIS ACCEPTING IT
MR
 LADISLAW HAS PROBABLY BEEN SPEAKING TO YOU ON THIS SUBJECT
 SAIDMR
 CASAUBON WITH A CERTAIN BITING QUICKNESS NOT HABITUAL TO HIM
INDEED NO
 SAID DOROTHEA EARNESTLY
 HOW CAN YOU IMAGINE IT SINCEHE HAS SO LATELY DECLINED EVERYTHING FROM YOU
 I FEAR YOU THINK TOOHARDLY OF HIM DEAR
 HE ONLY TOLD ME A LITTLE ABOUT HIS PARENTS ANDGRANDPARENTS AND ALMOST ALL IN ANSWER TO MY QUESTIONS
 YOU ARE SOGOOD SO JUSTYOU HAVE DONE EVERYTHING YOU THOUGHT TO BE RIGHT
 BUT ITSEEMS TO ME CLEAR THAT MORE THAN THAT IS RIGHT AND I MUST SPEAK ABOUTIT SINCE I AM THE PERSON WHO WOULD GET WHAT IS CALLED BENEFIT BY THATMORE NOT BEING DONE
THERE WAS A PERCEPTIBLE PAUSE BEFORE MR
 CASAUBON REPLIED NOT QUICKLYAS BEFORE BUT WITH A STILL MORE BITING EMPHASIS
DOROTHEA MY LOVE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST OCCASION BUT IT WERE WELLTHAT IT SHOULD BE THE LAST ON WHICH YOU HAVE ASSUMED A JUDGMENT ONSUBJECTS BEYOND YOUR SCOPE
 INTO THE QUESTION HOW FAR CONDUCTESPECIALLY IN THE MATTER OF ALLIANCES CONSTITUTES A FORFEITURE OFFAMILY CLAIMS I DO NOT NOW ENTER
 SUFFICE IT THAT YOU ARE NOT HEREQUALIFIED TO DISCRIMINATE
 WHAT I NOW WISH YOU TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT IACCEPT NO REVISION STILL LESS DICTATION WITHIN THAT RANGE OF AFFAIRSWHICH I HAVE DELIBERATED UPON AS DISTINCTLY AND PROPERLY MINE
 IT ISNOT FOR YOU TO INTERFERE BETWEEN ME AND MR
 LADISLAW AND STILL LESS TOENCOURAGE COMMUNICATIONS FROM HIM TO YOU WHICH CONSTITUTE A CRITICISMON MY PROCEDURE
POOR DOROTHEA SHROUDED IN THE DARKNESS WAS IN A TUMULT OF CONFLICTINGEMOTIONS
 ALARM AT THE POSSIBLE EFFECT ON HIMSELF OF HER HUSBANDSSTRONGLY MANIFESTED ANGER WOULD HAVE CHECKED ANY EXPRESSION OF HER OWNRESENTMENT EVEN IF SHE HAD BEEN QUITE FREE FROM DOUBT AND COMPUNCTIONUNDER THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME JUSTICE IN HIS LASTINSINUATION
 HEARING HIM BREATHE QUICKLY AFTER HE HAD SPOKEN SHE SATLISTENING FRIGHTENED WRETCHEDWITH A DUMB INWARD CRY FOR HELP TO BEARTHIS NIGHTMARE OF A LIFE IN WHICH EVERY ENERGY WAS ARRESTED BY DREAD
BUT NOTHING ELSE HAPPENED EXCEPT THAT THEY BOTH REMAINED A LONG WHILESLEEPLESS WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN
THE NEXT DAY MR
 CASAUBON RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING ANSWER FROM WILLLADISLAWDEAR MR
 CASAUBONI HAVE GIVEN ALL DUE CONSIDERATION TO YOUR LETTEROF YESTERDAY BUT I AM UNABLE TO TAKE PRECISELY YOUR VIEW OF OUR MUTUALPOSITION
 WITH THE FULLEST ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF YOUR GENEROUS CONDUCT TOME IN THE PAST I MUST STILL MAINTAIN THAT AN OBLIGATION OF THIS KINDCANNOT FAIRLY FETTER ME AS YOU APPEAR TO EXPECT THAT IT SHOULD
 GRANTEDTHAT A BENEFACTORS WISHES MAY CONSTITUTE A CLAIM THERE MUST ALWAYS BEA RESERVATION AS TO THE QUALITY OF THOSE WISHES
 THEY MAY POSSIBLYCLASH WITH MORE IMPERATIVE CONSIDERATIONS
 OR A BENEFACTORS VETO MIGHTIMPOSE SUCH A NEGATION ON A MANS LIFE THAT THE CONSEQUENT BLANK MIGHTBE MORE CRUEL THAN THE BENEFACTION WAS GENEROUS
 I AM MERELY USINGSTRONG ILLUSTRATIONS
 IN THE PRESENT CASE I AM UNABLE TO TAKE YOUR VIEWOF THE BEARING WHICH MY ACCEPTANCE OF OCCUPATIONNOT ENRICHINGCERTAINLY BUT NOT DISHONORABLEWILL HAVE ON YOUR OWN POSITION WHICHSEEMS TO ME TOO SUBSTANTIAL TO BE AFFECTED IN THAT SHADOWY MANNER
 ANDTHOUGH I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY CHANGE IN OUR RELATIONS WILL OCCURCERTAINLY NONE HAS YET OCCURRED WHICH CAN NULLIFY THE OBLIGATIONSIMPOSED ON ME BY THE PAST PARDON ME FOR NOT SEEING THAT THOSEOBLIGATIONS SHOULD RESTRAIN ME FROM USING THE ORDINARY FREEDOM OFLIVING WHERE I CHOOSE AND MAINTAINING MYSELF BY ANY LAWFUL OCCUPATIONI MAY CHOOSE
 REGRETTING THAT THERE EXISTS THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN USAS TO A RELATION IN WHICH THE CONFERRING OF BENEFITS HAS BEEN ENTIRELYON YOUR SIDEI REMAIN YOURS WITH PERSISTENT OBLIGATIONWILL LADISLAW
POOR MR
 CASAUBON FELT AND MUST NOT WE BEING IMPARTIAL FEEL WITH HIMA LITTLE
 THAT NO MAN HAD JUSTER CAUSE FOR DISGUST AND SUSPICION THANHE
 YOUNG LADISLAW HE WAS SURE MEANT TO DEFY AND ANNOY HIM MEANT TOWIN DOROTHEAS CONFIDENCE AND SOW HER MIND WITH DISRESPECT AND PERHAPSAVERSION TOWARDS HER HUSBAND
 SOME MOTIVE BENEATH THE SURFACE HAD BEENNEEDED TO ACCOUNT FOR WILLS SUDDEN CHANGE OF COURSE IN REJECTING MR
CASAUBONS AID AND QUITTING HIS TRAVELS AND THIS DEFIANT DETERMINATIONTO FIX HIMSELF IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD BY TAKING UP SOMETHING SO MUCH ATVARIANCE WITH HIS FORMER CHOICE AS MR
 BROOKES MIDDLEMARCH PROJECTSREVEALED CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT THE UNDECLARED MOTIVE HAD RELATION TODOROTHEA
 NOT FOR ONE MOMENT DID MR
 CASAUBON SUSPECT DOROTHEA OF ANYDOUBLENESS HE HAD NO SUSPICIONS OF HER BUT HE HAD WHAT WAS LITTLELESS UNCOMFORTABLE THE POSITIVE KNOWLEDGE THAT HER TENDENCY TO FORMOPINIONS ABOUT HER HUSBANDS CONDUCT WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH A DISPOSITIONTO REGARD WILL LADISLAW FAVORABLY AND BE INFLUENCED BY WHAT HE SAID
HIS OWN PROUD RETICENCE HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM EVER BEING UNDECEIVED INTHE SUPPOSITION THAT DOROTHEA HAD ORIGINALLY ASKED HER UNCLE TO INVITEWILL TO HIS HOUSE
AND NOW ON RECEIVING WILLS LETTER MR
 CASAUBON HAD TO CONSIDER HISDUTY
 HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN EASY TO CALL HIS ACTION ANYTHING ELSETHAN DUTY BUT IN THIS CASE CONTENDING MOTIVES THRUST HIM BACK INTONEGATIONS
SHOULD HE APPLY DIRECTLY TO MR
 BROOKE AND DEMAND OF THAT TROUBLESOMEGENTLEMAN TO REVOKE HIS PROPOSAL
 OR SHOULD HE CONSULT SIR JAMESCHETTAM AND GET HIM TO CONCUR IN REMONSTRANCE AGAINST A STEP WHICHTOUCHED THE WHOLE FAMILY
 IN EITHER CASE MR
 CASAUBON WAS AWARE THATFAILURE WAS JUST AS PROBABLE AS SUCCESS
 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TOMENTION DOROTHEAS NAME IN THE MATTER AND WITHOUT SOME ALARMINGURGENCY MR
 BROOKE WAS AS LIKELY AS NOT AFTER MEETING ALLREPRESENTATIONS WITH APPARENT ASSENT TO WIND UP BY SAYING NEVERFEAR CASAUBON
 DEPEND UPON IT YOUNG LADISLAW WILL DO YOU CREDIT
DEPEND UPON IT I HAVE PUT MY FINGER ON THE RIGHT THING
 AND MR
CASAUBON SHRANK NERVOUSLY FROM COMMUNICATING ON THE SUBJECT WITH SIRJAMES CHETTAM BETWEEN WHOM AND HIMSELF THERE HAD NEVER BEEN ANYCORDIALITY AND WHO WOULD IMMEDIATELY THINK OF DOROTHEA WITHOUT ANYMENTION OF HER
POOR MR
 CASAUBON WAS DISTRUSTFUL OF EVERYBODYS FEELING TOWARDS HIMESPECIALLY AS A HUSBAND
 TO LET ANY ONE SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS JEALOUSWOULD BE TO ADMIT THEIR SUSPECTED VIEW OF HIS DISADVANTAGES TO LETTHEM KNOW THAT HE DID NOT FIND MARRIAGE PARTICULARLY BLISSFUL WOULDIMPLY HIS CONVERSION TO THEIR PROBABLY EARLIER DISAPPROVAL
 IT WOULDBE AS BAD AS LETTING CARP AND BRASENOSE GENERALLY KNOW HOW BACKWARDHE WAS IN ORGANIZING THE MATTER FOR HIS KEY TO ALL MYTHOLOGIES
 ALLTHROUGH HIS LIFE MR
 CASAUBON HAD BEEN TRYING NOT TO ADMIT EVEN TOHIMSELF THE INWARD SORES OF SELFDOUBT AND JEALOUSY
 AND ON THE MOSTDELICATE OF ALL PERSONAL SUBJECTS THE HABIT OF PROUD SUSPICIOUSRETICENCE TOLD DOUBLY
THUS MR
 CASAUBON REMAINED PROUDLY BITTERLY SILENT
 BUT HE HADFORBIDDEN WILL TO COME TO LOWICK MANOR AND HE WAS MENTALLY PREPARINGOTHER MEASURES OF FRUSTRATION
CHAPTER XXXVIII
CEST BEAUCOUP QUE LE JUGEMENT DES HOMMES SUR LES ACTIONS HUMAINESTÔT OU TARD IL DEVIENT EFFICACE
GUIZOT
SIR JAMES CHETTAM COULD NOT LOOK WITH ANY SATISFACTION ON MR
 BROOKESNEW COURSES BUT IT WAS EASIER TO OBJECT THAN TO HINDER
 SIR JAMESACCOUNTED FOR HIS HAVING COME IN ALONE ONE DAY TO LUNCH WITH THECADWALLADERS BY SAYINGI CANT TALK TO YOU AS I WANT BEFORE CELIA IT MIGHT HURT HER
INDEED IT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANTHE PIONEER AT THE GRANGE
 DARTED IN MRS
CADWALLADER ALMOST BEFORE THE LAST WORD WAS OFF HER FRIENDS TONGUE
IT IS FRIGHTFULTHIS TAKING TO BUYING WHISTLES AND BLOWING THEM INEVERYBODYS HEARING
 LYING IN BED ALL DAY AND PLAYING AT DOMINOES LIKEPOOR LORD PLESSY WOULD BE MORE PRIVATE AND BEARABLE
I SEE THEY ARE BEGINNING TO ATTACK OUR FRIEND BROOKE IN THETRUMPET SAID THE RECTOR LOUNGING BACK AND SMILING EASILY AS HEWOULD HAVE DONE IF HE HAD BEEN ATTACKED HIMSELF
 THERE ARE TREMENDOUSSARCASMS AGAINST A LANDLORD NOT A HUNDRED MILES FROM MIDDLEMARCH WHORECEIVES HIS OWN RENTS AND MAKES NO RETURNS
I DO WISH BROOKE WOULD LEAVE THAT OFF SAID SIR JAMES WITH HISLITTLE FROWN OF ANNOYANCE
IS HE REALLY GOING TO BE PUT IN NOMINATION THOUGH
 SAID MR
CADWALLADER
 I SAW FAREBROTHER YESTERDAYHES WHIGGISH HIMSELF HOISTSBROUGHAM AND USEFUL KNOWLEDGE THATS THE WORST I KNOW OF HIMAND HESAYS THAT BROOKE IS GETTING UP A PRETTY STRONG PARTY
 BULSTRODE THEBANKER IS HIS FOREMOST MAN
 BUT HE THINKS BROOKE WOULD COME OFF BADLYAT A NOMINATION
EXACTLY SAID SIR JAMES WITH EARNESTNESS
 I HAVE BEEN INQUIRINGINTO THE THING FOR IVE NEVER KNOWN ANYTHING ABOUT MIDDLEMARCHPOLITICS BEFORETHE COUNTY BEING MY BUSINESS
 WHAT BROOKE TRUSTS TO ISTHAT THEY ARE GOING TO TURN OUT OLIVER BECAUSE HE IS A PEELITE
 BUTHAWLEY TELLS ME THAT IF THEY SEND UP A WHIG AT ALL IT IS SURE TO BEBAGSTER ONE OF THOSE CANDIDATES WHO COME FROM HEAVEN KNOWS WHERE BUTDEAD AGAINST MINISTERS AND AN EXPERIENCED PARLIAMENTARY MAN
 HAWLEYSRATHER ROUGH HE FORGOT THAT HE WAS SPEAKING TO ME
 HE SAID IF BROOKEWANTED A PELTING HE COULD GET IT CHEAPER THAN BY GOING TO THEHUSTINGS
I WARNED YOU ALL OF IT SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER WAVING HER HANDSOUTWARD
 I SAID TO HUMPHREY LONG AGO MR
 BROOKE IS GOING TO MAKE ASPLASH IN THE MUD
 AND NOW HE HAS DONE IT
WELL HE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN IT INTO HIS HEAD TO MARRY SAID THE RECTOR
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAVER MESS THAN A LITTLE FLIRTATION WITHPOLITICS
HE MAY DO THAT AFTERWARDS SAID MRS
 CADWALLADERWHEN HE HAS COMEOUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MUD WITH AN AGUE
WHAT I CARE FOR MOST IS HIS OWN DIGNITY SAID SIR JAMES
 OF COURSE ICARE THE MORE BECAUSE OF THE FAMILY
 BUT HES GETTING ON IN LIFE NOWAND I DONT LIKE TO THINK OF HIS EXPOSING HIMSELF
 THEY WILL BE RAKINGUP EVERYTHING AGAINST HIM
I SUPPOSE ITS NO USE TRYING ANY PERSUASION SAID THE RECTOR
THERES SUCH AN ODD MIXTURE OF OBSTINACY AND CHANGEABLENESS IN BROOKE
HAVE YOU TRIED HIM ON THE SUBJECT
WELL NO SAID SIR JAMES I FEEL A DELICACY IN APPEARING TO DICTATE
BUT I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO THIS YOUNG LADISLAW THAT BROOKE IS MAKING AFACTOTUM OF
 LADISLAW SEEMS CLEVER ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING
 I THOUGHT IT ASWELL TO HEAR WHAT HE HAD TO SAY AND HE IS AGAINST BROOKES STANDINGTHIS TIME
 I THINK HELL TURN HIM ROUND I THINK THE NOMINATION MAY BESTAVED OFF
I KNOW SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER NODDING
 THE INDEPENDENT MEMBERHASNT GOT HIS SPEECHES WELL ENOUGH BY HEART
BUT THIS LADISLAWTHERE AGAIN IS A VEXATIOUS BUSINESS SAID SIRJAMES
 WE HAVE HAD HIM TWO OR THREE TIMES TO DINE AT THE HALL YOUHAVE MET HIM BY THE BYE AS BROOKES GUEST AND A RELATION OFCASAUBONS THINKING HE WAS ONLY ON A FLYING VISIT
 AND NOW I FIND HESIN EVERYBODYS MOUTH IN MIDDLEMARCH AS THE EDITOR OF THE PIONEER
THERE ARE STORIES GOING ABOUT HIM AS A QUILLDRIVING ALIEN A FOREIGNEMISSARY AND WHAT NOT
CASAUBON WONT LIKE THAT SAID THE RECTOR
THERE IS SOME FOREIGN BLOOD IN LADISLAW RETURNED SIR JAMES
 IHOPE HE WONT GO INTO EXTREME OPINIONS AND CARRY BROOKE ON
OH HES A DANGEROUS YOUNG SPRIG THAT MR
 LADISLAW SAID MRS
CADWALLADER WITH HIS OPERA SONGS AND HIS READY TONGUE
 A SORT OFBYRONIC HEROAN AMOROUS CONSPIRATOR IT STRIKES ME
 AND THOMAS AQUINASIS NOT FOND OF HIM
 I COULD SEE THAT THE DAY THE PICTURE WAS BROUGHT
I DONT LIKE TO BEGIN ON THE SUBJECT WITH CASAUBON SAID SIR JAMES
HE HAS MORE RIGHT TO INTERFERE THAN I
 BUT ITS A DISAGREEABLE AFFAIRALL ROUND
 WHAT A CHARACTER FOR ANYBODY WITH DECENT CONNECTIONS TO SHOWHIMSELF IN
ONE OF THOSE NEWSPAPER FELLOWS
 YOU HAVE ONLY TO LOOK ATKECK WHO MANAGES THE TRUMPET
 I SAW HIM THE OTHER DAY WITH HAWLEY
HIS WRITING IS SOUND ENOUGH I BELIEVE BUT HES SUCH A LOW FELLOWTHAT I WISHED HE HAD BEEN ON THE WRONG SIDE
WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT WITH THESE PEDDLING MIDDLEMARCH PAPERS
 SAID THERECTOR
 I DONT SUPPOSE YOU COULD GET A HIGH STYLE OF MAN ANYWHERE TOBE WRITING UP INTERESTS HE DOESNT REALLY CARE ABOUT AND FOR PAY THATHARDLY KEEPS HIM IN AT ELBOWS
EXACTLY THAT MAKES IT SO ANNOYING THAT BROOKE SHOULD HAVE PUT A MANWHO HAS A SORT OF CONNECTION WITH THE FAMILY IN A POSITION OF THATKIND
 FOR MY PART I THINK LADISLAW IS RATHER A FOOL FOR ACCEPTING
IT IS AQUINASS FAULT SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER
 WHY DIDNT HE USE HISINTEREST TO GET LADISLAW MADE AN ATTACHE OR SENT TO INDIA
 THAT ISHOW FAMILIES GET RID OF TROUBLESOME SPRIGS
THERE IS NO KNOWING TO WHAT LENGTHS THE MISCHIEF MAY GO SAID SIRJAMES ANXIOUSLY
 BUT IF CASAUBON SAYS NOTHING WHAT CAN I DO
OH MY DEAR SIR JAMES SAID THE RECTOR DONT LET US MAKE TOO MUCH OFALL THIS
 IT IS LIKELY ENOUGH TO END IN MERE SMOKE
 AFTER A MONTH ORTWO BROOKE AND THIS MASTER LADISLAW WILL GET TIRED OF EACH OTHERLADISLAW WILL TAKE WING BROOKE WILL SELL THE PIONEER AND EVERYTHINGWILL SETTLE DOWN AGAIN AS USUAL
THERE IS ONE GOOD CHANCETHAT HE WILL NOT LIKE TO FEEL HIS MONEYOOZING AWAY SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER
 IF I KNEW THE ITEMS OF ELECTIONEXPENSES I COULD SCARE HIM
 ITS NO USE PLYING HIM WITH WIDE WORDS LIKEEXPENDITURE I WOULDNT TALK OF PHLEBOTOMY I WOULD EMPTY A POT OFLEECHES UPON HIM
 WHAT WE GOOD STINGY PEOPLE DONT LIKE IS HAVING OURSIXPENCES SUCKED AWAY FROM US
AND HE WILL NOT LIKE HAVING THINGS RAKED UP AGAINST HIM SAID SIRJAMES
 THERE IS THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS ESTATE
 THEY HAVE BEGUN UPONTHAT ALREADY
 AND IT REALLY IS PAINFUL FOR ME TO SEE
 IT IS A NUISANCEUNDER ONES VERY NOSE
 I DO THINK ONE IS BOUND TO DO THE BEST FOR ONESLAND AND TENANTS ESPECIALLY IN THESE HARD TIMES
PERHAPS THE TRUMPET MAY ROUSE HIM TO MAKE A CHANGE AND SOME GOODMAY COME OF IT ALL SAID THE RECTOR
 I KNOW I SHOULD BE GLAD
 ISHOULD HEAR LESS GRUMBLING WHEN MY TITHE IS PAID
 I DONT KNOW WHAT ISHOULD DO IF THERE WERE NOT A MODUS IN TIPTON
I WANT HIM TO HAVE A PROPER MAN TO LOOK AFTER THINGSI WANT HIM TOTAKE ON GARTH AGAIN SAID SIR JAMES
 HE GOT RID OF GARTH TWELVE YEARSAGO AND EVERYTHING HAS BEEN GOING WRONG SINCE
 I THINK OF GETTINGGARTH TO MANAGE FOR MEHE HAS MADE SUCH A CAPITAL PLAN FOR MYBUILDINGS AND LOVEGOOD IS HARDLY UP TO THE MARK
 BUT GARTH WOULD NOTUNDERTAKE THE TIPTON ESTATE AGAIN UNLESS BROOKE LEFT IT ENTIRELY TOHIM
IN THE RIGHT OF IT TOO SAID THE RECTOR
 GARTH IS AN INDEPENDENTFELLOW AN ORIGINAL SIMPLEMINDED FELLOW
 ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS DOINGSOME VALUATION FOR ME HE TOLD ME POINTBLANK THAT CLERGYMEN SELDOMUNDERSTOOD ANYTHING ABOUT BUSINESS AND DID MISCHIEF WHEN THEY MEDDLEDBUT HE SAID IT AS QUIETLY AND RESPECTFULLY AS IF HE HAD BEEN TALKING TOME ABOUT SAILORS
 HE WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENT PARISH OF TIPTON IF BROOKEWOULD LET HIM MANAGE
 I WISH BY THE HELP OF THE TRUMPET YOU COULDBRING THAT ROUND
IF DOROTHEA HAD KEPT NEAR HER UNCLE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMECHANCE SAID SIR JAMES
 SHE MIGHT HAVE GOT SOME POWER OVER HIM INTIME AND SHE WAS ALWAYS UNEASY ABOUT THE ESTATE
 SHE HAD WONDERFULLYGOOD NOTIONS ABOUT SUCH THINGS
 BUT NOW CASAUBON TAKES HER UP ENTIRELY
CELIA COMPLAINS A GOOD DEAL
 WE CAN HARDLY GET HER TO DINE WITH USSINCE HE HAD THAT FIT
 SIR JAMES ENDED WITH A LOOK OF PITYING DISGUSTAND MRS
 CADWALLADER SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AS MUCH AS TO SAY THATSHE WAS NOT LIKELY TO SEE ANYTHING NEW IN THAT DIRECTION
POOR CASAUBON
 THE RECTOR SAID
 THAT WAS A NASTY ATTACK
 I THOUGHTHE LOOKED SHATTERED THE OTHER DAY AT THE ARCHDEACONS
IN POINT OF FACT RESUMED SIR JAMES NOT CHOOSING TO DWELL ON FITSBROOKE DOESNT MEAN BADLY BY HIS TENANTS OR ANY ONE ELSE BUT HE HASGOT THAT WAY OF PARING AND CLIPPING AT EXPENSES
COME THATS A BLESSING SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER
 THAT HELPS HIM TOFIND HIMSELF IN A MORNING
 HE MAY NOT KNOW HIS OWN OPINIONS BUT HEDOES KNOW HIS OWN POCKET
I DONT BELIEVE A MAN IS IN POCKET BY STINGINESS ON HIS LAND SAIDSIR JAMES
OH STINGINESS MAY BE ABUSED LIKE OTHER VIRTUES IT WILL NOT DO TOKEEP ONES OWN PIGS LEAN SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER WHO HAD RISEN TO LOOKOUT OF THE WINDOW
 BUT TALK OF AN INDEPENDENT POLITICIAN AND HE WILLAPPEAR
WHAT
 BROOKE
 SAID HER HUSBAND
YES
 NOW YOU PLY HIM WITH THE TRUMPET HUMPHREY AND I WILL PUT THELEECHES ON HIM
 WHAT WILL YOU DO SIR JAMES
THE FACT IS I DONT LIKE TO BEGIN ABOUT IT WITH BROOKE IN OUR MUTUALPOSITION THE WHOLE THING IS SO UNPLEASANT
 I DO WISH PEOPLE WOULDBEHAVE LIKE GENTLEMEN SAID THE GOOD BARONET FEELING THAT THIS WAS ASIMPLE AND COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMME FOR SOCIAL WELLBEING
HERE YOU ALL ARE EH
 SAID MR
 BROOKE SHUFFLING ROUND AND SHAKINGHANDS
 I WAS GOING UP TO THE HALL BYANDBY CHETTAM
 BUT ITSPLEASANT TO FIND EVERYBODY YOU KNOW
 WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK OFTHINGS
GOING ON A LITTLE FAST
 IT WAS TRUE ENOUGH WHAT LAFITTESAIDSINCE YESTERDAY A CENTURY HAS PASSED AWAYTHEYRE IN THE NEXTCENTURY YOU KNOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WATER
 GOING ON FASTER THANWE ARE
WHY YES SAID THE RECTOR TAKING UP THE NEWSPAPER
 HERE IS THETRUMPET ACCUSING YOU OF LAGGING BEHINDDID YOU SEE
EH
 NO SAID MR
 BROOKE DROPPING HIS GLOVES INTO HIS HAT AND HASTILYADJUSTING HIS EYEGLASS
 BUT MR
 CADWALLADER KEPT THE PAPER IN HISHAND SAYING WITH A SMILE IN HIS EYESLOOK HERE
 ALL THIS IS ABOUT A LANDLORD NOT A HUNDRED MILES FROMMIDDLEMARCH WHO RECEIVES HIS OWN RENTS
 THEY SAY HE IS THE MOSTRETROGRESSIVE MAN IN THE COUNTY
 I THINK YOU MUST HAVE TAUGHT THEM THATWORD IN THE PIONEER
OH THAT IS KECKAN ILLITERATE FELLOW YOU KNOW
 RETROGRESSIVE NOW
COME THATS CAPITAL
 HE THINKS IT MEANS DESTRUCTIVE THEY WANT TO MAKEME OUT A DESTRUCTIVE YOU KNOW SAID MR
 BROOKE WITH THATCHEERFULNESS WHICH IS USUALLY SUSTAINED BY AN ADVERSARYS IGNORANCE
I THINK HE KNOWS THE MEANING OF THE WORD
 HERE IS A SHARP STROKE ORTWO
 IF WE HAD TO DESCRIBE A MAN WHO IS RETROGRESSIVE IN THE MOST EVILSENSE OF THE WORDWE SHOULD SAY HE IS ONE WHO WOULD DUB HIMSELF AREFORMER OF OUR CONSTITUTION WHILE EVERY INTEREST FOR WHICH HE ISIMMEDIATELY RESPONSIBLE IS GOING TO DECAY A PHILANTHROPIST WHO CANNOTBEAR ONE ROGUE TO BE HANGED BUT DOES NOT MIND FIVE HONEST TENANTSBEING HALFSTARVED A MAN WHO SHRIEKS AT CORRUPTION AND KEEPS HISFARMS AT RACKRENT WHO ROARS HIMSELF RED AT ROTTEN BOROUGHS AND DOESNOT MIND IF EVERY FIELD ON HIS FARMS HAS A ROTTEN GATE A MAN VERYOPENHEARTED TO LEEDS AND MANCHESTER NO DOUBT HE WOULD GIVE ANYNUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES WHO WILL PAY FOR THEIR SEATS OUT OF THEIR OWNPOCKETS WHAT HE OBJECTS TO GIVING IS A LITTLE RETURN ON RENTDAYS TOHELP A TENANT TO BUY STOCK OR AN OUTLAY ON REPAIRS TO KEEP THE WEATHEROUT AT A TENANTS BARNDOOR OR MAKE HIS HOUSE LOOK A LITTLE LESS LIKEAN IRISH COTTIERS
 BUT WE ALL KNOW THE WAGS DEFINITION OF APHILANTHROPIST A MAN WHOSE CHARITY INCREASES DIRECTLY AS THE SQUARE OFTHE DISTANCE
 AND SO ON
 ALL THE REST IS TO SHOW WHAT SORT OFLEGISLATOR A PHILANTHROPIST IS LIKELY TO MAKE ENDED THE RECTORTHROWING DOWN THE PAPER AND CLASPING HIS HANDS AT THE BACK OF HISHEAD WHILE HE LOOKED AT MR
 BROOKE WITH AN AIR OF AMUSED NEUTRALITY
COME THATS RATHER GOOD YOU KNOW SAID MR
 BROOKE TAKING UP THEPAPER AND TRYING TO BEAR THE ATTACK AS EASILY AS HIS NEIGHBOR DID BUTCOLORING AND SMILING RATHER NERVOUSLY THAT ABOUT ROARING HIMSELF REDAT ROTTEN BOROUGHSI NEVER MADE A SPEECH ABOUT ROTTEN BOROUGHS IN MYLIFE
 AND AS TO ROARING MYSELF RED AND THAT KIND OF THINGTHESE MENNEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOOD SATIRE
 SATIRE YOU KNOW SHOULD BE TRUEUP TO A CERTAIN POINT
 I RECOLLECT THEY SAID THAT IN THE EDINBURGHSOMEWHEREIT MUST BE TRUE UP TO A CERTAIN POINT
WELL THAT IS REALLY A HIT ABOUT THE GATES SAID SIR JAMES ANXIOUSTO TREAD CAREFULLY
 DAGLEY COMPLAINED TO ME THE OTHER DAY THAT HEHADNT GOT A DECENT GATE ON HIS FARM
 GARTH HAS INVENTED A NEW PATTERNOF GATEI WISH YOU WOULD TRY IT
 ONE OUGHT TO USE SOME OF ONES TIMBERIN THAT WAY
YOU GO IN FOR FANCY FARMING YOU KNOW CHETTAM SAID MR
 BROOKEAPPEARING TO GLANCE OVER THE COLUMNS OF THE TRUMPET
 THATS YOURHOBBY AND YOU DONT MIND THE EXPENSE
I THOUGHT THE MOST EXPENSIVE HOBBY IN THE WORLD WAS STANDING FORPARLIAMENT SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER
 THEY SAID THE LAST UNSUCCESSFULCANDIDATE AT MIDDLEMARCHGILES WASNT HIS NAME
SPENT TEN THOUSANDPOUNDS AND FAILED BECAUSE HE DID NOT BRIBE ENOUGH
 WHAT A BITTERREFLECTION FOR A MAN
SOMEBODY WAS SAYING SAID THE RECTOR LAUGHINGLY THAT EAST RETFORDWAS NOTHING TO MIDDLEMARCH FOR BRIBERY
NOTHING OF THE KIND SAID MR
 BROOKE
 THE TORIES BRIBE YOU KNOWHAWLEY AND HIS SET BRIBE WITH TREATING HOT CODLINGS AND THAT SORT OFTHING AND THEY BRING THE VOTERS DRUNK TO THE POLL
 BUT THEY ARE NOTGOING TO HAVE IT THEIR OWN WAY IN FUTURENOT IN FUTURE YOU KNOW
MIDDLEMARCH IS A LITTLE BACKWARD I ADMITTHE FREEMEN ARE A LITTLEBACKWARD
 BUT WE SHALL EDUCATE THEMWE SHALL BRING THEM ON YOU KNOW
THE BEST PEOPLE THERE ARE ON OUR SIDE
HAWLEY SAYS YOU HAVE MEN ON YOUR SIDE WHO WILL DO YOU HARM REMARKEDSIR JAMES
 HE SAYS BULSTRODE THE BANKER WILL DO YOU HARM
AND THAT IF YOU GOT PELTED INTERPOSED MRS
 CADWALLADER HALF THEROTTEN EGGS WOULD MEAN HATRED OF YOUR COMMITTEEMAN
 GOOD HEAVENS
THINK WHAT IT MUST BE TO BE PELTED FOR WRONG OPINIONS
 AND I SEEM TOREMEMBER A STORY OF A MAN THEY PRETENDED TO CHAIR AND LET HIM FALL INTOA DUSTHEAP ON PURPOSE
PELTING IS NOTHING TO THEIR FINDING HOLES IN ONES COAT SAID THERECTOR
 I CONFESS THATS WHAT I SHOULD BE AFRAID OF IF WE PARSONS HADTO STAND AT THE HUSTINGS FOR PREFERMENT
 I SHOULD BE AFRAID OF THEIRRECKONING UP ALL MY FISHING DAYS
 UPON MY WORD I THINK THE TRUTH ISTHE HARDEST MISSILE ONE CAN BE PELTED WITH
THE FACT IS SAID SIR JAMES IF A MAN GOES INTO PUBLIC LIFE HE MUSTBE PREPARED FOR THE CONSEQUENCES
 HE MUST MAKE HIMSELF PROOF AGAINSTCALUMNY
MY DEAR CHETTAM THAT IS ALL VERY FINE YOU KNOW SAID MR
 BROOKE
BUT HOW WILL YOU MAKE YOURSELF PROOF AGAINST CALUMNY
 YOU SHOULD READHISTORYLOOK AT OSTRACISM PERSECUTION MARTYRDOM AND THAT KIND OFTHING
 THEY ALWAYS HAPPEN TO THE BEST MEN YOU KNOW
 BUT WHAT IS THATIN HORACE
FIAT JUSTITIA RUAT  SOMETHING OR OTHER
EXACTLY SAID SIR JAMES WITH A LITTLE MORE HEAT THAN USUAL
 WHAT IMEAN BY BEING PROOF AGAINST CALUMNY IS BEING ABLE TO POINT TO THE FACTAS A CONTRADICTION
AND IT IS NOT MARTYRDOM TO PAY BILLS THAT ONE HAS RUN INTO ONESSELF SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER
BUT IT WAS SIR JAMESS EVIDENT ANNOYANCE THAT MOST STIRRED MR
 BROOKE
WELL YOU KNOW CHETTAM HE SAID RISING TAKING UP HIS HAT ANDLEANING ON HIS STICK YOU AND I HAVE A DIFFERENT SYSTEM
 YOU ARE ALLFOR OUTLAY WITH YOUR FARMS
 I DONT WANT TO MAKE OUT THAT MY SYSTEM ISGOOD UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCESUNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES YOU KNOW
THERE OUGHT TO BE A NEW VALUATION MADE FROM TIME TO TIME SAID SIRJAMES
 RETURNS ARE VERY WELL OCCASIONALLY BUT I LIKE A FAIRVALUATION
 WHAT DO YOU SAY CADWALLADER
I AGREE WITH YOU
 IF I WERE BROOKE I WOULD CHOKE THE TRUMPET ATONCE BY GETTING GARTH TO MAKE A NEW VALUATION OF THE FARMS AND GIVINGHIM CARTE BLANCHE ABOUT GATES AND REPAIRS THATS MY VIEW OF THEPOLITICAL SITUATION SAID THE RECTOR BROADENING HIMSELF BY STICKINGHIS THUMBS IN HIS ARMHOLES AND LAUGHING TOWARDS MR
 BROOKE
THATS A SHOWY SORT OF THING TO DO YOU KNOW SAID MR
 BROOKE
 BUT ISHOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME OF ANOTHER LANDLORD WHO HAS DISTRESSED HISTENANTS FOR ARREARS AS LITTLE AS I HAVE
 I LET THE OLD TENANTS STAY ON
IM UNCOMMONLY EASY LET ME TELL YOU UNCOMMONLY EASY
 I HAVE MY OWNIDEAS AND I TAKE MY STAND ON THEM YOU KNOW
 A MAN WHO DOES THAT ISALWAYS CHARGED WITH ECCENTRICITY INCONSISTENCY AND THAT KIND OFTHING
 WHEN I CHANGE MY LINE OF ACTION I SHALL FOLLOW MY OWN IDEAS
AFTER THAT MR
 BROOKE REMEMBERED THAT THERE WAS A PACKET WHICH HE HADOMITTED TO SEND OFF FROM THE GRANGE AND HE BADE EVERYBODY HURRIEDLYGOODBY
I DIDNT WANT TO TAKE A LIBERTY WITH BROOKE SAID SIR JAMES I SEEHE IS NETTLED
 BUT AS TO WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT OLD TENANTS IN POINT OFFACT NO NEW TENANT WOULD TAKE THE FARMS ON THE PRESENT TERMS
I HAVE A NOTION THAT HE WILL BE BROUGHT ROUND IN TIME SAID THERECTOR
 BUT YOU WERE PULLING ONE WAY ELINOR AND WE WERE PULLINGANOTHER
 YOU WANTED TO FRIGHTEN HIM AWAY FROM EXPENSE AND WE WANT TOFRIGHTEN HIM INTO IT
 BETTER LET HIM TRY TO BE POPULAR AND SEE THAT HISCHARACTER AS A LANDLORD STANDS IN HIS WAY
 I DONT THINK IT SIGNIFIESTWO STRAWS ABOUT THE PIONEER OR LADISLAW OR BROOKES SPEECHIFYINGTO THE MIDDLEMARCHERS
 BUT IT DOES SIGNIFY ABOUT THE PARISHIONERS INTIPTON BEING COMFORTABLE
EXCUSE ME IT IS YOU TWO WHO ARE ON THE WRONG TACK SAID MRS
CADWALLADER
 YOU SHOULD HAVE PROVED TO HIM THAT HE LOSES MONEY BY BADMANAGEMENT AND THEN WE SHOULD ALL HAVE PULLED TOGETHER
 IF YOU PUT HIMAHORSEBACK ON POLITICS I WARN YOU OF THE CONSEQUENCES
 IT WAS ALLVERY WELL TO RIDE ON STICKS AT HOME AND CALL THEM IDEAS

SIR JAMES CHETTAMS MIND WAS NOT FRUITFUL IN DEVICES BUT HIS GROWINGANXIETY TO ACT ON BROOKE ONCE BROUGHT CLOSE TO HIS CONSTANT BELIEFIN DOROTHEAS CAPACITY FOR INFLUENCE BECAME FORMATIVE AND ISSUED IN ALITTLE PLAN NAMELY TO PLEAD CELIAS INDISPOSITION AS A REASON FORFETCHING DOROTHEA BY HERSELF TO THE HALL AND TO LEAVE HER AT THEGRANGE WITH THE CARRIAGE ON THE WAY AFTER MAKING HER FULLY AWARE OFTHE SITUATION CONCERNING THE MANAGEMENT OF THE ESTATE
IN THIS WAY IT HAPPENED THAT ONE DAY NEAR FOUR OCLOCK WHEN MR
 BROOKEAND LADISLAW WERE SEATED IN THE LIBRARY THE DOOR OPENED AND MRS
CASAUBON WAS ANNOUNCED
WILL THE MOMENT BEFORE HAD BEEN LOW IN THE DEPTHS OF BOREDOM ANDOBLIGED TO HELP MR
 BROOKE IN ARRANGING DOCUMENTS ABOUT HANGINGSHEEPSTEALERS WAS EXEMPLIFYING THE POWER OUR MINDS HAVE OF RIDINGSEVERAL HORSES AT ONCE BY INWARDLY ARRANGING MEASURES TOWARDS GETTING ALODGING FOR HIMSELF IN MIDDLEMARCH AND CUTTING SHORT HIS CONSTANTRESIDENCE AT THE GRANGE WHILE THERE FLITTED THROUGH ALL THESE STEADIERIMAGES A TICKLING VISION OF A SHEEPSTEALING EPIC WRITTEN WITH HOMERICPARTICULARITY
 WHEN MRS
 CASAUBON WAS ANNOUNCED HE STARTED UP AS FROMAN ELECTRIC SHOCK AND FELT A TINGLING AT HIS FINGERENDS
 ANY ONEOBSERVING HIM WOULD HAVE SEEN A CHANGE IN HIS COMPLEXION IN THEADJUSTMENT OF HIS FACIAL MUSCLES IN THE VIVIDNESS OF HIS GLANCE WHICHMIGHT HAVE MADE THEM IMAGINE THAT EVERY MOLECULE IN HIS BODY HAD PASSEDTHE MESSAGE OF A MAGIC TOUCH
 AND SO IT HAD
 FOR EFFECTIVE MAGIC ISTRANSCENDENT NATURE AND WHO SHALL MEASURE THE SUBTLETY OF THOSETOUCHES WHICH CONVEY THE QUALITY OF SOUL AS WELL AS BODY AND MAKE AMANS PASSION FOR ONE WOMAN DIFFER FROM HIS PASSION FOR ANOTHER AS JOYIN THE MORNING LIGHT OVER VALLEY AND RIVER AND WHITE MOUNTAINTOPDIFFERS FROM JOY AMONG CHINESE LANTERNS AND GLASS PANELS
 WILL TOOWAS MADE OF VERY IMPRESSIBLE STUFF
 THE BOW OF A VIOLIN DRAWN NEAR HIMCLEVERLY WOULD AT ONE STROKE CHANGE THE ASPECT OF THE WORLD FOR HIMAND HIS POINT OF VIEW SHIFTED AS EASILY AS HIS MOOD
 DOROTHEASENTRANCE WAS THE FRESHNESS OF MORNING
WELL MY DEAR THIS IS PLEASANT NOW SAID MR
 BROOKE MEETING ANDKISSING HER
 YOU HAVE LEFT CASAUBON WITH HIS BOOKS I SUPPOSE
 THATSRIGHT
 WE MUST NOT HAVE YOU GETTING TOO LEARNED FOR A WOMAN YOU KNOW
THERE IS NO FEAR OF THAT UNCLE SAID DOROTHEA TURNING TO WILL ANDSHAKING HANDS WITH OPEN CHEERFULNESS WHILE SHE MADE NO OTHER FORM OFGREETING BUT WENT ON ANSWERING HER UNCLE
 I AM VERY SLOW
 WHEN I WANTTO BE BUSY WITH BOOKS I AM OFTEN PLAYING TRUANT AMONG MY THOUGHTS
 IFIND IT IS NOT SO EASY TO BE LEARNED AS TO PLAN COTTAGES
SHE SEATED HERSELF BESIDE HER UNCLE OPPOSITE TO WILL AND WAS EVIDENTLYPREOCCUPIED WITH SOMETHING THAT MADE HER ALMOST UNMINDFUL OF HIM
 HEWAS RIDICULOUSLY DISAPPOINTED AS IF HE HAD IMAGINED THAT HER COMINGHAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM
WHY YES MY DEAR IT WAS QUITE YOUR HOBBY TO DRAW PLANS
 BUT IT WASGOOD TO BREAK THAT OFF A LITTLE
 HOBBIES ARE APT TO RUN AWAY WITH USYOU KNOW IT DOESNT DO TO BE RUN AWAY WITH
 WE MUST KEEP THE REINS
 IHAVE NEVER LET MYSELF BE RUN AWAY WITH I ALWAYS PULLED UP
 THAT ISWHAT I TELL LADISLAW
 HE AND I ARE ALIKE YOU KNOW HE LIKES TO GO INTOEVERYTHING
 WE ARE WORKING AT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
 WE SHALL DO A GREATDEAL TOGETHER LADISLAW AND I
YES SAID DOROTHEA WITH CHARACTERISTIC DIRECTNESS SIR JAMES HASBEEN TELLING ME THAT HE IS IN HOPE OF SEEING A GREAT CHANGE MADE SOONIN YOUR MANAGEMENT OF THE ESTATETHAT YOU ARE THINKING OF HAVING THEFARMS VALUED AND REPAIRS MADE AND THE COTTAGES IMPROVED SO THATTIPTON MAY LOOK QUITE ANOTHER PLACE
 OH HOW HAPPY
SHE WENT ONCLASPING HER HANDS WITH A RETURN TO THAT MORE CHILDLIKE IMPETUOUSMANNER WHICH HAD BEEN SUBDUED SINCE HER MARRIAGE
 IF I WERE AT HOMESTILL I SHOULD TAKE TO RIDING AGAIN THAT I MIGHT GO ABOUT WITH YOUAND SEE ALL THAT
 AND YOU ARE GOING TO ENGAGE MR
 GARTH WHO PRAISED MYCOTTAGES SIR JAMES SAYS
CHETTAM IS A LITTLE HASTY MY DEAR SAID MR
 BROOKE COLORINGSLIGHTLY A LITTLE HASTY YOU KNOW
 I NEVER SAID I SHOULD DO ANYTHINGOF THE KIND
 I NEVER SAID I SHOULD NOT DO IT YOU KNOW
HE ONLY FEELS CONFIDENT THAT YOU WILL DO IT SAID DOROTHEA IN AVOICE AS CLEAR AND UNHESITATING AS THAT OF A YOUNG CHORISTER CHANTING ACREDO BECAUSE YOU MEAN TO ENTER PARLIAMENT AS A MEMBER WHO CARES FORTHE IMPROVEMENT OF THE PEOPLE AND ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS TO BE MADEBETTER IS THE STATE OF THE LAND AND THE LABORERS
 THINK OF KIT DOWNESUNCLE WHO LIVES WITH HIS WIFE AND SEVEN CHILDREN IN A HOUSE WITH ONESITTING ROOM AND ONE BEDROOM HARDLY LARGER THAN THIS TABLE
AND THOSEPOOR DAGLEYS IN THEIR TUMBLEDOWN FARMHOUSE WHERE THEY LIVE IN THEBACK KITCHEN AND LEAVE THE OTHER ROOMS TO THE RATS
 THAT IS ONE REASONWHY I DID NOT LIKE THE PICTURES HERE DEAR UNCLEWHICH YOU THINK MESTUPID ABOUT
 I USED TO COME FROM THE VILLAGE WITH ALL THAT DIRT ANDCOARSE UGLINESS LIKE A PAIN WITHIN ME AND THE SIMPERING PICTURES INTHE DRAWINGROOM SEEMED TO ME LIKE A WICKED ATTEMPT TO FIND DELIGHT INWHAT IS FALSE WHILE WE DONT MIND HOW HARD THE TRUTH IS FOR THENEIGHBORS OUTSIDE OUR WALLS
 I THINK WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO COME FORWARDAND URGE WIDER CHANGES FOR GOOD UNTIL WE HAVE TRIED TO ALTER THE EVILSWHICH LIE UNDER OUR OWN HANDS
DOROTHEA HAD GATHERED EMOTION AS SHE WENT ON AND HAD FORGOTTENEVERYTHING EXCEPT THE RELIEF OF POURING FORTH HER FEELINGS UNCHECKEDAN EXPERIENCE ONCE HABITUAL WITH HER BUT HARDLY EVER PRESENT SINCE HERMARRIAGE WHICH HAD BEEN A PERPETUAL STRUGGLE OF ENERGY WITH FEAR
 FORTHE MOMENT WILLS ADMIRATION WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH A CHILLING SENSE OFREMOTENESS
 A MAN IS SELDOM ASHAMED OF FEELING THAT HE CANNOT LOVE AWOMAN SO WELL WHEN HE SEES A CERTAIN GREATNESS IN HER NATURE HAVINGINTENDED GREATNESS FOR MEN
 BUT NATURE HAS SOMETIMES MADE SADOVERSIGHTS IN CARRYING OUT HER INTENTION AS IN THE CASE OF GOOD MR
BROOKE WHOSE MASCULINE CONSCIOUSNESS WAS AT THIS MOMENT IN RATHER ASTAMMERING CONDITION UNDER THE ELOQUENCE OF HIS NIECE
 HE COULD NOTIMMEDIATELY FIND ANY OTHER MODE OF EXPRESSING HIMSELF THAN THAT OFRISING FIXING HIS EYEGLASS AND FINGERING THE PAPERS BEFORE HIM
 ATLAST HE SAIDTHERE IS SOMETHING IN WHAT YOU SAY MY DEAR SOMETHING IN WHAT YOUSAYBUT NOT EVERYTHINGEH LADISLAW
 YOU AND I DONT LIKE OUR PICTURESAND STATUES BEING FOUND FAULT WITH
 YOUNG LADIES ARE A LITTLE ARDENTYOU KNOWA LITTLE ONESIDED MY DEAR
 FINE ART POETRY THAT KIND OFTHING ELEVATES A NATIONEMOLLIT MORESYOU UNDERSTAND A LITTLE LATINNOW
 BUTEH
 WHAT
THESE INTERROGATIVES WERE ADDRESSED TO THE FOOTMAN WHO HAD COME IN TOSAY THAT THE KEEPER HAD FOUND ONE OF DAGLEYS BOYS WITH A LEVERET INHIS HAND JUST KILLED
ILL COME ILL COME
 I SHALL LET HIM OFF EASILY YOU KNOW SAID MR
BROOKE ASIDE TO DOROTHEA SHUFFLING AWAY VERY CHEERFULLY
I HOPE YOU FEEL HOW RIGHT THIS CHANGE IS THAT ITHAT SIR JAMES WISHESFOR SAID DOROTHEA TO WILL AS SOON AS HER UNCLE WAS GONE
I DO NOW I HAVE HEARD YOU SPEAK ABOUT IT
 I SHALL NOT FORGET WHAT YOUHAVE SAID
 BUT CAN YOU THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE AT THIS MOMENT
 I MAYNOT HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO YOU ABOUT WHAT HASOCCURRED SAID WILL RISING WITH A MOVEMENT OF IMPATIENCE AND HOLDINGTHE BACK OF HIS CHAIR WITH BOTH HANDS
PRAY TELL ME WHAT IT IS SAID DOROTHEA ANXIOUSLY ALSO RISING ANDGOING TO THE OPEN WINDOW WHERE MONK WAS LOOKING IN PANTING ANDWAGGING HIS TAIL
 SHE LEANED HER BACK AGAINST THE WINDOWFRAME ANDLAID HER HAND ON THE DOGS HEAD FOR THOUGH AS WE KNOW SHE WAS NOTFOND OF PETS THAT MUST BE HELD IN THE HANDS OR TRODDEN ON SHE WASALWAYS ATTENTIVE TO THE FEELINGS OF DOGS AND VERY POLITE IF SHE HAD TODECLINE THEIR ADVANCES
WILL FOLLOWED HER ONLY WITH HIS EYES AND SAID I PRESUME YOU KNOW THATMR
 CASAUBON HAS FORBIDDEN ME TO GO TO HIS HOUSE
NO I DID NOT SAID DOROTHEA AFTER A MOMENTS PAUSE
 SHE WASEVIDENTLY MUCH MOVED
 I AM VERY VERY SORRY SHE ADDED MOURNFULLY
SHE WAS THINKING OF WHAT WILL HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OFTHE CONVERSATIONBETWEEN HER AND HER HUSBAND IN THE DARKNESS AND SHE WAS ANEW SMITTENWITH HOPELESSNESS THAT SHE COULD INFLUENCE MR
 CASAUBONS ACTION
 BUTTHE MARKED EXPRESSION OF HER SORROW CONVINCED WILL THAT IT WAS NOT ALLGIVEN TO HIM PERSONALLY AND THAT DOROTHEA HAD NOT BEEN VISITED BY THEIDEA THAT MR
 CASAUBONS DISLIKE AND JEALOUSY OF HIM TURNED UPONHERSELF
 HE FELT AN ODD MIXTURE OF DELIGHT AND VEXATION OF DELIGHTTHAT HE COULD DWELL AND BE CHERISHED IN HER THOUGHT AS IN A PURE HOMEWITHOUT SUSPICION AND WITHOUT STINTOF VEXATION BECAUSE HE WAS OF TOOLITTLE ACCOUNT WITH HER WAS NOT FORMIDABLE ENOUGH WAS TREATED WITH ANUNHESITATING BENEVOLENCE WHICH DID NOT FLATTER HIM
 BUT HIS DREAD OFANY CHANGE IN DOROTHEA WAS STRONGER THAN HIS DISCONTENT AND HE BEGANTO SPEAK AGAIN IN A TONE OF MERE EXPLANATION
MR
 CASAUBONS REASON IS HIS DISPLEASURE AT MY TAKING A POSITION HEREWHICH HE CONSIDERS UNSUITED TO MY RANK AS HIS COUSIN
 I HAVE TOLD HIMTHAT I CANNOT GIVE WAY ON THIS POINT
 IT IS A LITTLE TOO HARD ON ME TOEXPECT THAT MY COURSE IN LIFE IS TO BE HAMPERED BY PREJUDICES WHICH ITHINK RIDICULOUS
 OBLIGATION MAY BE STRETCHED TILL IT IS NO BETTER THANA BRAND OF SLAVERY STAMPED ON US WHEN WE WERE TOO YOUNG TO KNOW ITSMEANING
 I WOULD NOT HAVE ACCEPTED THE POSITION IF I HAD NOT MEANT TOMAKE IT USEFUL AND HONORABLE
 I AM NOT BOUND TO REGARD FAMILY DIGNITYIN ANY OTHER LIGHT
DOROTHEA FELT WRETCHED
 SHE THOUGHT HER HUSBAND ALTOGETHER IN THEWRONG ON MORE GROUNDS THAN WILL HAD MENTIONED
IT IS BETTER FOR US NOT TO SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT SHE SAID WITH ATREMULOUSNESS NOT COMMON IN HER VOICE SINCE YOU AND MR
 CASAUBONDISAGREE
 YOU INTEND TO REMAIN
 SHE WAS LOOKING OUT ON THE LAWN WITHMELANCHOLY MEDITATION
YES BUT I SHALL HARDLY EVER SEE YOU NOW SAID WILL IN A TONE OFALMOST BOYISH COMPLAINT
NO SAID DOROTHEA TURNING HER EYES FULL UPON HIM HARDLY EVER
 BUTI SHALL HEAR OF YOU
 I SHALL KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING FOR MY UNCLE
I SHALL KNOW HARDLY ANYTHING ABOUT YOU SAID WILL
 NO ONE WILL TELLME ANYTHING
OH MY LIFE IS VERY SIMPLE SAID DOROTHEA HER LIPS CURLING WITH ANEXQUISITE SMILE WHICH IRRADIATED HER MELANCHOLY
 I AM ALWAYS ATLOWICK
THAT IS A DREADFUL IMPRISONMENT SAID WILL IMPETUOUSLY
NO DONT THINK THAT SAID DOROTHEA
 I HAVE NO LONGINGS
HE DID NOT SPEAK BUT SHE REPLIED TO SOME CHANGE IN HIS EXPRESSION
 IMEAN FOR MYSELF
 EXCEPT THAT I SHOULD LIKE NOT TO HAVE SO MUCH MORETHAN MY SHARE WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING FOR OTHERS
 BUT I HAVE A BELIEF OFMY OWN AND IT COMFORTS ME
WHAT IS THAT
 SAID WILL RATHER JEALOUS OF THE BELIEF
THAT BY DESIRING WHAT IS PERFECTLY GOOD EVEN WHEN WE DONT QUITE KNOWWHAT IT IS AND CANNOT DO WHAT WE WOULD WE ARE PART OF THE DIVINE POWERAGAINST EVILWIDENING THE SKIRTS OF LIGHT AND MAKING THE STRUGGLE WITHDARKNESS NARROWER
THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL MYSTICISMIT IS APLEASE NOT TO CALL IT BY ANY NAME SAID DOROTHEA PUTTING OUT HERHANDS ENTREATINGLY
 YOU WILL SAY IT IS PERSIAN OR SOMETHING ELSEGEOGRAPHICAL
 IT IS MY LIFE
 I HAVE FOUND IT OUT AND CANNOT PART WITHIT
 I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FINDING OUT MY RELIGION SINCE I WAS A LITTLEGIRL
 I USED TO PRAY SO MUCHNOW I HARDLY EVER PRAY
 I TRY NOT TO HAVEDESIRES MERELY FOR MYSELF BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE GOOD FOR OTHERS ANDI HAVE TOO MUCH ALREADY
 I ONLY TOLD YOU THAT YOU MIGHT KNOW QUITEWELL HOW MY DAYS GO AT LOWICK
GOD BLESS YOU FOR TELLING ME
 SAID WILL ARDENTLY AND RATHERWONDERING AT HIMSELF
 THEY WERE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER LIKE TWO FONDCHILDREN WHO WERE TALKING CONFIDENTIALLY OF BIRDS
WHAT IS YOUR RELIGION
 SAID DOROTHEA
 I MEANNOT WHAT YOU KNOWABOUT RELIGION BUT THE BELIEF THAT HELPS YOU MOST
TO LOVE WHAT IS GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL WHEN I SEE IT SAID WILL
 BUT IAM A REBEL I DONT FEEL BOUND AS YOU DO TO SUBMIT TO WHAT I DONTLIKE
BUT IF YOU LIKE WHAT IS GOOD THAT COMES TO THE SAME THING SAIDDOROTHEA SMILING
NOW YOU ARE SUBTLE SAID WILL
YES MR
 CASAUBON OFTEN SAYS I AM TOO SUBTLE
 I DONT FEEL AS IF IWERE SUBTLE SAID DOROTHEA PLAYFULLY
 BUT HOW LONG MY UNCLE IS
 IMUST GO AND LOOK FOR HIM
 I MUST REALLY GO ON TO THE HALL
 CELIA ISEXPECTING ME
WILL OFFERED TO TELL MR
 BROOKE WHO PRESENTLY CAME AND SAID THAT HEWOULD STEP INTO THE CARRIAGE AND GO WITH DOROTHEA AS FAR AS DAGLEYSTO SPEAK ABOUT THE SMALL DELINQUENT WHO HAD BEEN CAUGHT WITH THELEVERET
 DOROTHEA RENEWED THE SUBJECT OF THE ESTATE AS THEY DROVEALONG BUT MR
 BROOKE NOT BEING TAKEN UNAWARES GOT THE TALK UNDER HISOWN CONTROL
CHETTAM NOW HE REPLIED HE FINDS FAULT WITH ME MY DEAR BUT ISHOULD NOT PRESERVE MY GAME IF IT WERE NOT FOR CHETTAM AND HE CANTSAY THAT THAT EXPENSE IS FOR THE SAKE OF THE TENANTS YOU KNOW
 ITS ALITTLE AGAINST MY FEELINGPOACHING NOW IF YOU COME TO LOOK INTO ITIHAVE OFTEN THOUGHT OF GETTING UP THE SUBJECT
 NOT LONG AGO FLAVELLTHE METHODIST PREACHER WAS BROUGHT UP FOR KNOCKING DOWN A HARE THATCAME ACROSS HIS PATH WHEN HE AND HIS WIFE WERE WALKING OUT TOGETHER
 HEWAS PRETTY QUICK AND KNOCKED IT ON THE NECK
THAT WAS VERY BRUTAL I THINK SAID DOROTHEA
WELL NOW IT SEEMED RATHER BLACK TO ME I CONFESS IN A METHODISTPREACHER YOU KNOW
 AND JOHNSON SAID YOU MAY JUDGE WHAT A HYPOCRITEHE IS
 AND UPON MY WORD I THOUGHT FLAVELL LOOKED VERY LITTLE LIKETHE HIGHEST STYLE OF MANAS SOMEBODY CALLS THE CHRISTIANYOUNG THEPOET YOUNG I THINKYOU KNOW YOUNG
 WELL NOW FLAVELL IN HIS SHABBYBLACK GAITERS PLEADING THAT HE THOUGHT THE LORD HAD SENT HIM AND HISWIFE A GOOD DINNER AND HE HAD A RIGHT TO KNOCK IT DOWN THOUGH NOT AMIGHTY HUNTER BEFORE THE LORD AS NIMROD WASI ASSURE YOU IT WAS RATHERCOMIC FIELDING WOULD HAVE MADE SOMETHING OF ITOR SCOTT NOWSCOTTMIGHT HAVE WORKED IT UP
 BUT REALLY WHEN I CAME TO THINK OF IT ICOULDNT HELP LIKING THAT THE FELLOW SHOULD HAVE A BIT OF HARE TO SAYGRACE OVER
 ITS ALL A MATTER OF PREJUDICEPREJUDICE WITH THE LAW ONITS SIDE YOU KNOWABOUT THE STICK AND THE GAITERS AND SO ON
 HOWEVERIT DOESNT DO TO REASON ABOUT THINGS AND LAW IS LAW
 BUT I GOT JOHNSONTO BE QUIET AND I HUSHED THE MATTER UP
 I DOUBT WHETHER CHETTAM WOULDNOT HAVE BEEN MORE SEVERE AND YET HE COMES DOWN ON ME AS IF I WERE THEHARDEST MAN IN THE COUNTY
 BUT HERE WE ARE AT DAGLEYS
MR
 BROOKE GOT DOWN AT A FARMYARDGATE AND DOROTHEA DROVE ON
 IT ISWONDERFUL HOW MUCH UGLIER THINGS WILL LOOK WHEN WE ONLY SUSPECT THAT WEARE BLAMED FOR THEM
 EVEN OUR OWN PERSONS IN THE GLASS ARE APT TOCHANGE THEIR ASPECT FOR US AFTER WE HAVE HEARD SOME FRANK REMARK ONTHEIR LESS ADMIRABLE POINTS AND ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS ASTONISHINGHOW PLEASANTLY CONSCIENCE TAKES OUR ENCROACHMENTS ON THOSE WHO NEVERCOMPLAIN OR HAVE NOBODY TO COMPLAIN FOR THEM
 DAGLEYS HOMESTEAD NEVERBEFORE LOOKED SO DISMAL TO MR
 BROOKE AS IT DID TODAY WITH HIS MINDTHUS SORE ABOUT THE FAULTFINDING OF THE TRUMPET ECHOED BY SIRJAMES
IT IS TRUE THAT AN OBSERVER UNDER THAT SOFTENING INFLUENCE OF THE FINEARTS WHICH MAKES OTHER PEOPLES HARDSHIPS PICTURESQUE MIGHT HAVE BEENDELIGHTED WITH THIS HOMESTEAD CALLED FREEMANS END THE OLD HOUSE HADDORMERWINDOWS IN THE DARK RED ROOF TWO OF THE CHIMNEYS WERE CHOKEDWITH IVY THE LARGE PORCH WAS BLOCKED UP WITH BUNDLES OF STICKS ANDHALF THE WINDOWS WERE CLOSED WITH GRAY WORMEATEN SHUTTERS ABOUT WHICHTHE JASMINEBOUGHS GREW IN WILD LUXURIANCE THE MOULDERING GARDEN WALLWITH HOLLYHOCKS PEEPING OVER IT WAS A PERFECT STUDY OF HIGHLY MINGLEDSUBDUED COLOR AND THERE WAS AN AGED GOAT KEPT DOUBTLESS ONINTERESTING SUPERSTITIOUS GROUNDS LYING AGAINST THE OPEN BACKKITCHENDOOR
 THE MOSSY THATCH OF THE COWSHED THE BROKEN GRAY BARNDOORS THEPAUPER LABORERS IN RAGGED BREECHES WHO HAD NEARLY FINISHED UNLOADING AWAGON OF CORN INTO THE BARN READY FOR EARLY THRASHING THE SCANTY DAIRYOF COWS BEING TETHERED FOR MILKING AND LEAVING ONE HALF OF THE SHED INBROWN EMPTINESS THE VERY PIGS AND WHITE DUCKS SEEMING TO WANDER ABOUTTHE UNEVEN NEGLECTED YARD AS IF IN LOW SPIRITS FROM FEEDING ON A TOOMEAGRE QUALITY OF RINSINGSALL THESE OBJECTS UNDER THE QUIET LIGHT OFA SKY MARBLED WITH HIGH CLOUDS WOULD HAVE MADE A SORT OF PICTURE WHICHWE HAVE ALL PAUSED OVER AS A CHARMING BIT TOUCHING OTHERSENSIBILITIES THAN THOSE WHICH ARE STIRRED BY THE DEPRESSION OF THEAGRICULTURAL INTEREST WITH THE SAD LACK OF FARMING CAPITAL AS SEENCONSTANTLY IN THE NEWSPAPERS OF THAT TIME
 BUT THESE TROUBLESOMEASSOCIATIONS WERE JUST NOW STRONGLY PRESENT TO MR
 BROOKE AND SPOILEDTHE SCENE FOR HIM
 MR
 DAGLEY HIMSELF MADE A FIGURE IN THE LANDSCAPECARRYING A PITCHFORK AND WEARING HIS MILKINGHATA VERY OLD BEAVERFLATTENED IN FRONT
 HIS COAT AND BREECHES WERE THE BEST HE HAD AND HEWOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WEARING THEM ON THIS WEEKDAY OCCASION IF HE HAD NOTBEEN TO MARKET AND RETURNED LATER THAN USUAL HAVING GIVEN HIMSELF THERARE TREAT OF DINING AT THE PUBLIC TABLE OF THE BLUE BULL
 HOW HE CAMETO FALL INTO THIS EXTRAVAGANCE WOULD PERHAPS BE MATTER OF WONDERMENT TOHIMSELF ON THE MORROW BUT BEFORE DINNER SOMETHING IN THE STATE OF THECOUNTRY A SLIGHT PAUSE IN THE HARVEST BEFORE THE FAR DIPS WERE CUTTHE STORIES ABOUT THE NEW KING AND THE NUMEROUS HANDBILLS ON THE WALLSHAD SEEMED TO WARRANT A LITTLE RECKLESSNESS
 IT WAS A MAXIM ABOUTMIDDLEMARCH AND REGARDED AS SELFEVIDENT THAT GOOD MEAT SHOULD HAVEGOOD DRINK WHICH LAST DAGLEY INTERPRETED AS PLENTY OF TABLE ALE WELLFOLLOWED UP BY RUMANDWATER
 THESE LIQUORS HAVE SO FAR TRUTH IN THEMTHAT THEY WERE NOT FALSE ENOUGH TO MAKE POOR DAGLEY SEEM MERRY THEYONLY MADE HIS DISCONTENT LESS TONGUETIED THAN USUAL
 HE HAD ALSO TAKENTOO MUCH IN THE SHAPE OF MUDDY POLITICAL TALK A STIMULANT DANGEROUSLYDISTURBING TO HIS FARMING CONSERVATISM WHICH CONSISTED IN HOLDING THATWHATEVER IS IS BAD AND ANY CHANGE IS LIKELY TO BE WORSE
 HE WASFLUSHED AND HIS EYES HAD A DECIDEDLY QUARRELSOME STARE AS HE STOODSTILL GRASPING HIS PITCHFORK WHILE THE LANDLORD APPROACHED WITH HISEASY SHUFFLING WALK ONE HAND IN HIS TROUSERPOCKET AND THE OTHERSWINGING ROUND A THIN WALKINGSTICK
DAGLEY MY GOOD FELLOW BEGAN MR
 BROOKE CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS GOINGTO BE VERY FRIENDLY ABOUT THE BOY
OH AY IM A GOOD FELLER AM I
 THANK YE SIR THANK YE SAIDDAGLEY WITH A LOUD SNARLING IRONY WHICH MADE FAG THE SHEEPDOG STIRFROM HIS SEAT AND PRICK HIS EARS BUT SEEING MONK ENTER THE YARD AFTERSOME OUTSIDE LOITERING FAG SEATED HIMSELF AGAIN IN AN ATTITUDE OFOBSERVATION
 IM GLAD TO HEAR IM A GOOD FELLER
MR
 BROOKE REFLECTED THAT IT WAS MARKETDAY AND THAT HIS WORTHY TENANTHAD PROBABLY BEEN DINING BUT SAW NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD NOT GO ONSINCE HE COULD TAKE THE PRECAUTION OF REPEATING WHAT HE HAD TO SAY TOMRS
 DAGLEY
YOUR LITTLE LAD JACOB HAS BEEN CAUGHT KILLING A LEVERET DAGLEY IHAVE TOLD JOHNSON TO LOCK HIM UP IN THE EMPTY STABLE AN HOUR OR TWOJUST TO FRIGHTEN HIM YOU KNOW

 BROOKE SAYING SOOTHINGLY WELL WELL ILL SPEAK TOYOUR WIFEI DIDNT MEAN BEATING YOU KNOW TURNED TO WALK TO THEHOUSE
 BUT DAGLEY ONLY THE MORE INCLINED TO HAVE HIS SAY WITH AGENTLEMAN WHO WALKED AWAY FROM HIM FOLLOWED AT ONCE WITH FAGSLOUCHING AT HIS HEELS AND SULLENLY EVADING SOME SMALL AND PROBABLYCHARITABLE ADVANCES ON THE PART OF MONK
HOW DO YOU DO MRS
 DAGLEY
 SAID MR
 BROOKE MAKING SOME HASTE
 ICAME TO TELL YOU ABOUT YOUR BOY I DONT WANT YOU TO GIVE HIM THESTICK YOU KNOW
 HE WAS CAREFUL TO SPEAK QUITE PLAINLY THIS TIME
OVERWORKED MRS
 DAGLEYA THIN WORN WOMAN FROM WHOSE LIFE PLEASURE HADSO ENTIRELY VANISHED THAT SHE HAD NOT EVEN ANY SUNDAY CLOTHES WHICHCOULD GIVE HER SATISFACTION IN PREPARING FOR CHURCHHAD ALREADY HAD AMISUNDERSTANDING WITH HER HUSBAND SINCE HE HAD COME HOME AND WAS INLOW SPIRITS EXPECTING THE WORST
 BUT HER HUSBAND WAS BEFOREHAND INANSWERING
NO NOR HE WOONT HEV THE STICK WHETHER YOU WANT IT OR NO PURSUEDDAGLEY THROWING OUT HIS VOICE AS IF HE WANTED IT TO HIT HARD
 YOUVEGOT NO CALL TO COME AN TALK ABOUT STICKS O THESE PRIMISES AS YOUWOONT GIVE A STICK TOWRT MENDING
 GO TO MIDDLEMARCH TO AX FOR YOURCHARRICKTER
YOUD FAR BETTER HOLD YOUR TONGUE DAGLEY SAID THE WIFE AND NOTKICK YOUR OWN TROUGH OVER
 WHEN A MAN AS IS FATHER OF A FAMILY HAS BEENAN SPENT MONEY AT MARKET AND MADE HIMSELF THE WORSE FOR LIQUOR HESDONE ENOUGH MISCHIEF FOR ONE DAY
 BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT MYBOYS DONE SIR
NIVER DO YOU MIND WHAT HES DONE SAID DAGLEY MORE FIERCELY ITSMY BUSINESS TO SPEAK AN NOT YOURN
 AN I WULL SPEAK TOO
 ILL HEV MYSAYSUPPER OR NO
 AN WHAT I SAY IS AS IVE LIVED UPO YOUR GROUNDFROM MY FATHER AND GRANDFATHER AFORE ME AN HEV DROPPED OUR MONEYINTOT AN ME AN MY CHILDREN MIGHT LIE AN ROT ON THE GROUND FORTOPDRESSIN AS WE CANT FIND THE MONEY TO BUY IF THE KING WASNT TOPUT A STOP
MY GOOD FELLOW YOURE DRUNK YOU KNOW SAID MR
 BROOKECONFIDENTIALLY BUT NOT JUDICIOUSLY
 ANOTHER DAY ANOTHER DAY HEADDED TURNING AS IF TO GO
BUT DAGLEY IMMEDIATELY FRONTED HIM AND FAG AT HIS HEELS GROWLED LOWAS HIS MASTERS VOICE GREW LOUDER AND MORE INSULTING WHILE MONK ALSODREW CLOSE IN SILENT DIGNIFIED WATCH
 THE LABORERS ON THE WAGON WEREPAUSING TO LISTEN AND IT SEEMED WISER TO BE QUITE PASSIVE THAN TOATTEMPT A RIDICULOUS FLIGHT PURSUED BY A BAWLING MAN
IM NO MORE DRUNK NOR YOU ARE NOR SO MUCH SAID DAGLEY
 I CAN CARRYMY LIQUOR AN I KNOW WHAT I MEEAN
 AN I MEEAN AS THE KING ULL PUT ASTOP TO T FOR THEM SAY IT AS KNOWS IT AS THERES TO BE A RINFORMAND THEM LANDLORDS AS NEVER DONE THE RIGHT THING BY THEIR TENANTS ULLBE TREATED I THAT WAY AS THEYLL HEV TO SCUTTLE OFF
 AN THERES THEMI MIDDLEMARCH KNOWS WHAT THE RINFORM ISAN AS KNOWS WHOLL HEV TOSCUTTLE

 AN YOU MAY DO AS YOU LIKE NOW FOR IMNONE AFEARD ON YOU
 AN YOUD BETTER LET MY BOY ALOAN AN LOOK TOYOURSEN AFORE THE RINFORM HAS GOT UPO YOUR BACK
 THATS WHAT IN GOTTO SAY CONCLUDED MR
 DAGLEY STRIKING HIS FORK INTO THE GROUND WITH AFIRMNESS WHICH PROVED INCONVENIENT AS HE TRIED TO DRAW IT UP AGAIN
AT THIS LAST ACTION MONK BEGAN TO BARK LOUDLY AND IT WAS A MOMENT FORMR
 BROOKE TO ESCAPE
 HE WALKED OUT OF THE YARD AS QUICKLY AS HE COULDIN SOME AMAZEMENT AT THE NOVELTY OF HIS SITUATION
 HE HAD NEVER BEENINSULTED ON HIS OWN LAND BEFORE AND HAD BEEN INCLINED TO REGARDHIMSELF AS A GENERAL FAVORITE WE ARE ALL APT TO DO SO WHEN WE THINKOF OUR OWN AMIABILITY MORE THAN OF WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO WANTOF US
 WHEN HE HAD QUARRELLED WITH CALEB GARTH TWELVE YEARS BEFORE HEHAD THOUGHT THAT THE TENANTS WOULD BE PLEASED AT THE LANDLORDS TAKINGEVERYTHING INTO HIS OWN HANDS
SOME WHO FOLLOW THE NARRATIVE OF HIS EXPERIENCE MAY WONDER AT THEMIDNIGHT DARKNESS OF MR
 DAGLEY BUT NOTHING WAS EASIER IN THOSE TIMESTHAN FOR AN HEREDITARY FARMER OF HIS GRADE TO BE IGNORANT IN SPITESOMEHOW OF HAVING A RECTOR IN THE TWIN PARISH WHO WAS A GENTLEMAN TOTHE BACKBONE A CURATE NEARER AT HAND WHO PREACHED MORE LEARNEDLY THANTHE RECTOR A LANDLORD WHO HAD GONE INTO EVERYTHING ESPECIALLY FINEART AND SOCIAL IMPROVEMENT AND ALL THE LIGHTS OF MIDDLEMARCH ONLYTHREE MILES OFF
 AS TO THE FACILITY WITH WHICH MORTALS ESCAPEKNOWLEDGE TRY AN AVERAGE ACQUAINTANCE IN THE INTELLECTUAL BLAZE OFLONDON AND CONSIDER WHAT THAT ELIGIBLE PERSON FOR A DINNERPARTY WOULDHAVE BEEN IF HE HAD LEARNED SCANT SKILL IN SUMMING FROM THEPARISHCLERK OF TIPTON AND READ A CHAPTER IN THE BIBLE WITH IMMENSEDIFFICULTY BECAUSE SUCH NAMES AS ISAIAH OR APOLLOS REMAINEDUNMANAGEABLE AFTER TWICE SPELLING
 POOR DAGLEY READ A FEW VERSESSOMETIMES ON A SUNDAY EVENING AND THE WORLD WAS AT LEAST NOT DARKER TOHIM THAN IT HAD BEEN BEFORE
 SOME THINGS HE KNEW THOROUGHLY NAMELYTHE SLOVENLY HABITS OF FARMING AND THE AWKWARDNESS OF WEATHER STOCKAND CROPS AT FREEMANS ENDSO CALLED APPARENTLY BY WAY OF SARCASM TOIMPLY THAT A MAN WAS FREE TO QUIT IT IF HE CHOSE BUT THAT THERE WAS NOEARTHLY BEYOND OPEN TO HIM
CHAPTER XL
WISE IN HIS DAILY WORK WAS HE    TO FRUITS OF DILIGENCEAND NOT TO FAITHS OR POLITY    HE PLIED HIS UTMOST SENSE
THESE PERFECT IN THEIR LITTLE PARTS    WHOSE WORK IS ALL THEIR PRIZEWITHOUT THEM HOW COULD LAWS OR ARTS    OR TOWERED CITIES RISE
IN WATCHING EFFECTS IF ONLY OF AN ELECTRIC BATTERY IT IS OFTENNECESSARY TO CHANGE OUR PLACE AND EXAMINE A PARTICULAR MIXTURE OR GROUPAT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE POINT WHERE THE MOVEMENT WE ARE INTERESTED INWAS SET UP
 THE GROUP I AM MOVING TOWARDS IS AT CALEB GARTHSBREAKFASTTABLE IN THE LARGE PARLOR WHERE THE MAPS AND DESK WEREFATHER MOTHER AND FIVE OF THE CHILDREN
 MARY WAS JUST NOW AT HOMEWAITING FOR A SITUATION WHILE CHRISTY THE BOY NEXT TO HER WASGETTING CHEAP LEARNING AND CHEAP FARE IN SCOTLAND HAVING TO HISFATHERS DISAPPOINTMENT TAKEN TO BOOKS INSTEAD OF THAT SACRED CALLINGBUSINESS
THE LETTERS HAD COMENINE COSTLY LETTERS FOR WHICH THE POSTMAN HADBEEN PAID THREE AND TWOPENCE AND MR
 GARTH WAS FORGETTING HIS TEA ANDTOAST WHILE HE READ HIS LETTERS AND LAID THEM OPEN ONE ABOVE THE OTHERSOMETIMES SWAYING HIS HEAD SLOWLY SOMETIMES SCREWING UP HIS MOUTH ININWARD DEBATE BUT NOT FORGETTING TO CUT OFF A LARGE RED SEAL UNBROKENWHICH LETTY SNATCHED UP LIKE AN EAGER TERRIER
THE TALK AMONG THE REST WENT ON UNRESTRAINEDLY FOR NOTHING DISTURBEDCALEBS ABSORPTION EXCEPT SHAKING THE TABLE WHEN HE WAS WRITING
TWO LETTERS OF THE NINE HAD BEEN FOR MARY
 AFTER READING THEM SHE HADPASSED THEM TO HER MOTHER AND SAT PLAYING WITH HER TEASPOON ABSENTLYTILL WITH A SUDDEN RECOLLECTION SHE RETURNED TO HER SEWING WHICH SHEHAD KEPT ON HER LAP DURING BREAKFAST
OH DONT SEW MARY
 SAID BEN PULLING HER ARM DOWN
 MAKE ME APEACOCK WITH THIS BREADCRUMB
 HE HAD BEEN KNEADING A SMALL MASS FORTHE PURPOSE
NO NO MISCHIEF
 SAID MARY GOODHUMOREDLY WHILE SHE PRICKED HISHAND LIGHTLY WITH HER NEEDLE
 TRY AND MOULD IT YOURSELF YOU HAVE SEENME DO IT OFTEN ENOUGH
 I MUST GET THIS SEWING DONE
 IT IS FOR ROSAMONDVINCY SHE IS TO BE MARRIED NEXT WEEK AND SHE CANT BE MARRIED WITHOUTTHIS HANDKERCHIEF
 MARY ENDED MERRILY AMUSED WITH THE LAST NOTION
WHY CANT SHE MARY
 SAID LETTY SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN THISMYSTERY AND PUSHING HER HEAD SO CLOSE TO HER SISTER THAT MARY NOWTURNED THE THREATENING NEEDLE TOWARDS LETTYS NOSE
BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF A DOZEN AND WITHOUT IT THERE WOULD ONLY BEELEVEN SAID MARY WITH A GRAVE AIR OF EXPLANATION SO THAT LETTY SANKBACK WITH A SENSE OF KNOWLEDGE

TEACHING SEEMS TO ME THE MOST DELIGHTFUL WORK IN THE WORLD SAID MRS
GARTH WITH A TOUCH OF REBUKE IN HER TONE
 I COULD UNDERSTAND YOUROBJECTION TO IT IF YOU HAD NOT KNOWLEDGE ENOUGH MARY OR IF YOUDISLIKED CHILDREN
I SUPPOSE WE NEVER QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY ANOTHER DISLIKES WHAT WE LIKEMOTHER SAID MARY RATHER CURTLY
 I AM NOT FOND OF A SCHOOLROOM ILIKE THE OUTSIDE WORLD BETTER
 IT IS A VERY INCONVENIENT FAULT OFMINE
IT MUST BE VERY STUPID TO BE ALWAYS IN A GIRLS SCHOOL SAID ALFRED

 THEY CAN NEITHERTHROW NOR LEAP
 I DONT WONDER AT MARYS NOT LIKING IT

POOR CHILD
 I WISH SHE COULD STAY AT HOME WITH US SUSAN SAID CALEBLOOKING PLAINTIVELY AT HIS WIFE
MARY WOULD NOT BE HAPPY WITHOUT DOING HER DUTY SAID MRS
 GARTHMAGISTERIALLY CONSCIOUS OF HAVING DONE HER OWN
IT WOULDNT MAKE ME HAPPY TO DO SUCH A NASTY DUTY AS THAT SAIDALFREDAT WHICH MARY AND HER FATHER LAUGHED SILENTLY BUT MRS
 GARTHSAID GRAVELYDO FIND A FITTER WORD THAN NASTY MY DEAR ALFRED FOR EVERYTHING THATYOU THINK DISAGREEABLE
 AND SUPPOSE THAT MARY COULD HELP YOU TO GO TOMR
 HANMERS WITH THE MONEY SHE GETS
THAT SEEMS TO ME A GREAT SHAME
 BUT SHES AN OLD BRICK SAID ALFREDRISING FROM HIS CHAIR AND PULLING MARYS HEAD BACKWARD TO KISS HER
MARY COLORED AND LAUGHED BUT COULD NOT CONCEAL THAT THE TEARS WERECOMING
 CALEB LOOKING ON OVER HIS SPECTACLES WITH THE ANGLES OF HISEYEBROWS FALLING HAD AN EXPRESSION OF MINGLED DELIGHT AND SORROW AS HERETURNED TO THE OPENING OF HIS LETTER AND EVEN MRS
 GARTH HER LIPSCURLING WITH A CALM CONTENTMENT ALLOWED THAT INAPPROPRIATE LANGUAGE TOPASS WITHOUT CORRECTION ALTHOUGH BEN IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT UP AND SANGSHES AN OLD BRICK OLD BRICK OLD BRICK
 TO A CANTERING MEASUREWHICH HE BEAT OUT WITH HIS FIST ON MARYS ARM
BUT MRS
 GARTHS EYES WERE NOW DRAWN TOWARDS HER HUSBAND WHO WASALREADY DEEP IN THE LETTER HE WAS READING
 HIS FACE HAD AN EXPRESSIONOF GRAVE SURPRISE WHICH ALARMED HER A LITTLE BUT HE DID NOT LIKE TOBE QUESTIONED WHILE HE WAS READING AND SHE REMAINED ANXIOUSLY WATCHINGTILL SHE SAW HIM SUDDENLY SHAKEN BY A LITTLE JOYOUS LAUGH AS HE TURNEDBACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE LETTER AND LOOKING AT HER ABOVE HISSPECTACLES SAID IN A LOW TONE WHAT DO YOU THINK SUSAN
SHE WENT AND STOOD BEHIND HIM PUTTING HER HAND ON HIS SHOULDER WHILETHEY READ THE LETTER TOGETHER
 IT WAS FROM SIR JAMES CHETTAM OFFERINGTO MR
 GARTH THE MANAGEMENT OF THE FAMILY ESTATES AT FRESHITT ANDELSEWHERE AND ADDING THAT SIR JAMES HAD BEEN REQUESTED BY MR
 BROOKEOF TIPTON TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER MR
 GARTH WOULD BE DISPOSED AT THE SAMETIME TO RESUME THE AGENCY OF THE TIPTON PROPERTY
 THE BARONET ADDED INVERY OBLIGING WORDS THAT HE HIMSELF WAS PARTICULARLY DESIROUS OF SEEINGTHE FRESHITT AND TIPTON ESTATES UNDER THE SAME MANAGEMENT AND HE HOPEDTO BE ABLE TO SHOW THAT THE DOUBLE AGENCY MIGHT BE HELD ON TERMSAGREEABLE TO MR
 GARTH WHOM HE WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE AT THE HALL ATTWELVE OCLOCK ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
HE WRITES HANDSOMELY DOESNT HE SUSAN
 SAID CALEB TURNING HIS EYESUPWARD TO HIS WIFE WHO RAISED HER HAND FROM HIS SHOULDER TO HIS EARWHILE SHE RESTED HER CHIN ON HIS HEAD
 BROOKE DIDNT LIKE TO ASK MEHIMSELF I CAN SEE HE CONTINUED LAUGHING SILENTLY
HERE IS AN HONOR TO YOUR FATHER CHILDREN SAID MRS
 GARTH LOOKINGROUND AT THE FIVE PAIR OF EYES ALL FIXED ON THE PARENTS
 HE IS ASKEDTO TAKE A POST AGAIN BY THOSE WHO DISMISSED HIM LONG AGO
 THAT SHOWSTHAT HE DID HIS WORK WELL SO THAT THEY FEEL THE WANT OF HIM
LIKE CINCINNATUSHOORAY
 SAID BEN RIDING ON HIS CHAIR WITH APLEASANT CONFIDENCE THAT DISCIPLINE WAS RELAXED
WILL THEY COME TO FETCH HIM MOTHER
 SAID LETTY THINKING OF THEMAYOR AND CORPORATION IN THEIR ROBES
MRS
 GARTH PATTED LETTYS HEAD AND SMILED BUT SEEING THAT HER HUSBANDWAS GATHERING UP HIS LETTERS AND LIKELY SOON TO BE OUT OF REACH IN THATSANCTUARY BUSINESS SHE PRESSED HIS SHOULDER AND SAID EMPHATICALLYNOW MIND YOU ASK FAIR PAY CALEB
OH YES SAID CALEB IN A DEEP VOICE OF ASSENT AS IF IT WOULD BEUNREASONABLE TO SUPPOSE ANYTHING ELSE OF HIM
 ITLL COME TO BETWEENFOUR AND FIVE HUNDRED THE TWO TOGETHER
 THEN WITH A LITTLE START OFREMEMBRANCE HE SAID MARY WRITE AND GIVE UP THAT SCHOOL
 STAY ANDHELP YOUR MOTHER
 IM AS PLEASED AS PUNCH NOW IVE THOUGHT OF THAT
NO MANNER COULD HAVE BEEN LESS LIKE THAT OF PUNCH TRIUMPHANT THANCALEBS BUT HIS TALENTS DID NOT LIE IN FINDING PHRASES THOUGH HE WASVERY PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS LETTERWRITING AND REGARDED HIS WIFE AS ATREASURY OF CORRECT LANGUAGE
THERE WAS ALMOST AN UPROAR AMONG THE CHILDREN NOW AND MARY HELD UP THECAMBRIC EMBROIDERY TOWARDS HER MOTHER ENTREATINGLY THAT IT MIGHT BEPUT OUT OF REACH WHILE THE BOYS DRAGGED HER INTO A DANCE
 MRS
 GARTHIN PLACID JOY BEGAN TO PUT THE CUPS AND PLATES TOGETHER WHILE CALEBPUSHING HIS CHAIR FROM THE TABLE AS IF HE WERE GOING TO MOVE TO THEDESK STILL SAT HOLDING HIS LETTERS IN HIS HAND AND LOOKING ON THEGROUND MEDITATIVELY STRETCHING OUT THE FINGERS OF HIS LEFT HANDACCORDING TO A MUTE LANGUAGE OF HIS OWN
 AT LAST HE SAIDITS A THOUSAND PITIES CHRISTY DIDNT TAKE TO BUSINESS SUSAN
 I SHALLWANT HELP BYANDBY
 AND ALFRED MUST GO OFF TO THE ENGINEERINGIVEMADE UP MY MIND TO THAT
 HE FELL INTO MEDITATION AND FINGERRHETORICAGAIN FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN CONTINUED I SHALL MAKE BROOKE HAVENEW AGREEMENTS WITH THE TENANTS AND I SHALL DRAW UP A ROTATION OFCROPS
 AND ILL LAY A WAGER WE CAN GET FINE BRICKS OUT OF THE CLAY ATBOTTS CORNER
 I MUST LOOK INTO THAT IT WOULD CHEAPEN THE REPAIRS
ITS A FINE BIT OF WORK SUSAN
 A MAN WITHOUT A FAMILY WOULD BE GLAD TODO IT FOR NOTHING
MIND YOU DONT THOUGH SAID HIS WIFE LIFTING UP HER FINGER
NO NO BUT ITS A FINE THING TO COME TO A MAN WHEN HES SEEN INTO THENATURE OF BUSINESS TO HAVE THE CHANCE OF GETTING A BIT OF THE COUNTRYINTO GOOD FETTLE AS THEY SAY AND PUTTING MEN INTO THE RIGHT WAY WITHTHEIR FARMING AND GETTING A BIT OF GOOD CONTRIVING AND SOLID BUILDINGDONETHAT THOSE WHO ARE LIVING AND THOSE WHO COME AFTER WILL BE THEBETTER FOR
 ID SOONER HAVE IT THAN A FORTUNE
 I HOLD IT THE MOSTHONORABLE WORK THAT IS
 HERE CALEB LAID DOWN HIS LETTERS THRUST HISFINGERS BETWEEN THE BUTTONS OF HIS WAISTCOAT AND SAT UPRIGHT BUTPRESENTLY PROCEEDED WITH SOME AWE IN HIS VOICE AND MOVING HIS HEADSLOWLY ASIDEITS A GREAT GIFT OF GOD SUSAN
THAT IT IS CALEB SAID HIS WIFE WITH ANSWERING FERVOR
 AND IT WILLBE A BLESSING TO YOUR CHILDREN TO HAVE HAD A FATHER WHO DID SUCH WORKA FATHER WHOSE GOOD WORK REMAINS THOUGH HIS NAME MAY BE FORGOTTEN
 SHECOULD NOT SAY ANY MORE TO HIM THEN ABOUT THE PAY
IN THE EVENING WHEN CALEB RATHER TIRED WITH HIS DAYS WORK WASSEATED IN SILENCE WITH HIS POCKETBOOK OPEN ON HIS KNEE WHILE MRS
GARTH AND MARY WERE AT THEIR SEWING AND LETTY IN A CORNER WASWHISPERING A DIALOGUE WITH HER DOLL MR
 FAREBROTHER CAME UP THEORCHARD WALK DIVIDING THE BRIGHT AUGUST LIGHTS AND SHADOWS WITH THETUFTED GRASS AND THE APPLETREE BOUGHS
 WE KNOW THAT HE WAS FOND OF HISPARISHIONERS THE GARTHS AND HAD THOUGHT MARY WORTH MENTIONING TOLYDGATE
 HE USED TO THE FULL THE CLERGYMANS PRIVILEGE OF DISREGARDINGTHE MIDDLEMARCH DISCRIMINATION OF RANKS AND ALWAYS TOLD HIS MOTHERTHAT MRS
 GARTH WAS MORE OF A LADY THAN ANY MATRON IN THE TOWN
 STILLYOU SEE HE SPENT HIS EVENINGS AT THE VINCYS WHERE THE MATRON THOUGHLESS OF A LADY PRESIDED OVER A WELLLIT DRAWINGROOM AND WHIST
 INTHOSE DAYS HUMAN INTERCOURSE WAS NOT DETERMINED SOLELY BY RESPECT
 BUTTHE VICAR DID HEARTILY RESPECT THE GARTHS AND A VISIT FROM HIM WAS NOSURPRISE TO THAT FAMILY
 NEVERTHELESS HE ACCOUNTED FOR IT EVEN WHILE HEWAS SHAKING HANDS BY SAYING I COME AS AN ENVOY MRS
 GARTH I HAVESOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU AND GARTH ON BEHALF OF FRED VINCY
 THE FACT ISPOOR FELLOW HE CONTINUED AS HE SEATED HIMSELF AND LOOKED ROUND WITHHIS BRIGHT GLANCE AT THE THREE WHO WERE LISTENING TO HIM HE HAS TAKENME INTO HIS CONFIDENCE
MARYS HEART BEAT RATHER QUICKLY SHE WONDERED HOW FAR FREDSCONFIDENCE HAD GONE
WE HAVENT SEEN THE LAD FOR MONTHS SAID CALEB
 I COULDNT THINKWHAT WAS BECOME OF HIM
HE HAS BEEN AWAY ON A VISIT SAID THE VICAR BECAUSE HOME WAS ALITTLE TOO HOT FOR HIM AND LYDGATE TOLD HIS MOTHER THAT THE POORFELLOW MUST NOT BEGIN TO STUDY YET
 BUT YESTERDAY HE CAME AND POUREDHIMSELF OUT TO ME
 I AM VERY GLAD HE DID BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN HIM GROWUP FROM A YOUNGSTER OF FOURTEEN AND I AM SO MUCH AT HOME IN THE HOUSETHAT THE CHILDREN ARE LIKE NEPHEWS AND NIECES TO ME
 BUT IT IS ADIFFICULT CASE TO ADVISE UPON
 HOWEVER HE HAS ASKED ME TO COME ANDTELL YOU THAT HE IS GOING AWAY AND THAT HE IS SO MISERABLE ABOUT HISDEBT TO YOU AND HIS INABILITY TO PAY THAT HE CANT BEAR TO COMEHIMSELF EVEN TO BID YOU GOOD BY
TELL HIM IT DOESNT SIGNIFY A FARTHING SAID CALEB WAVING HIS HAND
WEVE HAD THE PINCH AND HAVE GOT OVER IT
 AND NOW IM GOING TO BE ASRICH AS A JEW
WHICH MEANS SAID MRS
 GARTH SMILING AT THE VICAR THAT WE AREGOING TO HAVE ENOUGH TO BRING UP THE BOYS WELL AND TO KEEP MARY ATHOME
WHAT IS THE TREASURETROVE
 SAID MR
 FAREBROTHER
IM GOING TO BE AGENT FOR TWO ESTATES FRESHITT AND TIPTON ANDPERHAPS FOR A PRETTY LITTLE BIT OF LAND IN LOWICK BESIDES ITS ALL THESAME FAMILY CONNECTION AND EMPLOYMENT SPREADS LIKE WATER IF ITS ONCESET GOING
 IT MAKES ME VERY HAPPY MR
 FAREBROTHERHERE CALEB THREWBACK HIS HEAD A LITTLE AND SPREAD HIS ARMS ON THE ELBOWS OF HISCHAIRTHAT IVE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY AGAIN WITH THE LETTING OF THE LANDAND CARRYING OUT A NOTION OR TWO WITH IMPROVEMENTS
 ITS A MOSTUNCOMMONLY CRAMPING THING AS IVE OFTEN TOLD SUSAN TO SIT ONHORSEBACK AND LOOK OVER THE HEDGES AT THE WRONG THING AND NOT BE ABLETO PUT YOUR HAND TO IT TO MAKE IT RIGHT
 WHAT PEOPLE DO WHO GO INTOPOLITICS I CANT THINK IT DRIVES ME ALMOST MAD TO SEE MISMANAGEMENTOVER ONLY A FEW HUNDRED ACRES
IT WAS SELDOM THAT CALEB VOLUNTEERED SO LONG A SPEECH BUT HISHAPPINESS HAD THE EFFECT OF MOUNTAIN AIR HIS EYES WERE BRIGHT AND THEWORDS CAME WITHOUT EFFORT
I CONGRATULATE YOU HEARTILY GARTH SAID THE VICAR
 THIS IS THE BESTSORT OF NEWS I COULD HAVE HAD TO CARRY TO FRED VINCY FOR HE DWELT AGOOD DEAL ON THE INJURY HE HAD DONE YOU IN CAUSING YOU TO PART WITHMONEYROBBING YOU OF IT HE SAIDWHICH YOU WANTED FOR OTHER PURPOSES
 IWISH FRED WERE NOT SUCH AN IDLE DOG HE HAS SOME VERY GOOD POINTS ANDHIS FATHER IS A LITTLE HARD UPON HIM
WHERE IS HE GOING
 SAID MRS
 GARTH RATHER COLDLY
HE MEANS TO TRY AGAIN FOR HIS DEGREE AND HE IS GOING UP TO STUDYBEFORE TERM
 I HAVE ADVISED HIM TO DO THAT
 I DONT URGE HIM TO ENTERTHE CHURCHON THE CONTRARY
 BUT IF HE WILL GO AND WORK SO AS TO PASSTHAT WILL BE SOME GUARANTEE THAT HE HAS ENERGY AND A WILL AND HE ISQUITE AT SEA HE DOESNT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO
 SO FAR HE WILL PLEASEHIS FATHER AND I HAVE PROMISED IN THE MEAN TIME TO TRY AND RECONCILEVINCY TO HIS SONS ADOPTING SOME OTHER LINE OF LIFE
 FRED SAYS FRANKLYHE IS NOT FIT FOR A CLERGYMAN AND I WOULD DO ANYTHING I COULD TOHINDER A MAN FROM THE FATAL STEP OF CHOOSING THE WRONG PROFESSION
 HEQUOTED TO ME WHAT YOU SAID MISS GARTHDO YOU REMEMBER IT
 MR
FAREBROTHER USED TO SAY MARY INSTEAD OF MISS GARTH BUT IT WAS PARTOF HIS DELICACY TO TREAT HER WITH THE MORE DEFERENCE BECAUSE ACCORDINGTO MRS
 VINCYS PHRASE SHE WORKED FOR HER BREAD
MARY FELT UNCOMFORTABLE BUT DETERMINED TO TAKE THE MATTER LIGHTLYANSWERED AT ONCE I HAVE SAID SO MANY IMPERTINENT THINGS TO FREDWEARE SUCH OLD PLAYFELLOWS
YOU SAID ACCORDING TO HIM THAT HE WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE RIDICULOUSCLERGYMEN WHO HELP TO MAKE THE WHOLE CLERGY RIDICULOUS
 REALLY THATWAS SO CUTTING THAT I FELT A LITTLE CUT MYSELF
CALEB LAUGHED
 SHE GETS HER TONGUE FROM YOU SUSAN HE SAID WITHSOME ENJOYMENT
NOT ITS FLIPPANCY FATHER SAID MARY QUICKLY FEARING THAT HERMOTHER WOULD BE DISPLEASED
 IT IS RATHER TOO BAD OF FRED TO REPEAT MYFLIPPANT SPEECHES TO MR
 FAREBROTHER
IT WAS CERTAINLY A HASTY SPEECH MY DEAR SAID MRS
 GARTH WITH WHOMSPEAKING EVIL OF DIGNITIES WAS A HIGH MISDEMEANOR
 WE SHOULD NOT VALUEOUR VICAR THE LESS BECAUSE THERE WAS A RIDICULOUS CURATE IN THE NEXTPARISH
THERES SOMETHING IN WHAT SHE SAYS THOUGH SAID CALEB NOT DISPOSEDTO HAVE MARYS SHARPNESS UNDERVALUED
 A BAD WORKMAN OF ANY SORT MAKESHIS FELLOWS MISTRUSTED
 THINGS HANG TOGETHER HE ADDED LOOKING ON THEFLOOR AND MOVING HIS FEET UNEASILY WITH A SENSE THAT WORDS WERESCANTIER THAN THOUGHTS
CLEARLY SAID THE VICAR AMUSED
 BY BEING CONTEMPTIBLE WE SET MENSMINDS TO THE TUNE OF CONTEMPT
 I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH MISS GARTHS VIEWOF THE MATTER WHETHER I AM CONDEMNED BY IT OR NOT
 BUT AS TO FREDVINCY IT IS ONLY FAIR HE SHOULD BE EXCUSED A LITTLE OLDFEATHERSTONES DELUSIVE BEHAVIOR DID HELP TO SPOIL HIM
 THERE WASSOMETHING QUITE DIABOLICAL IN NOT LEAVING HIM A FARTHING AFTER ALL
 BUTFRED HAS THE GOOD TASTE NOT TO DWELL ON THAT
 AND WHAT HE CARES MOSTABOUT IS HAVING OFFENDED YOU MRS
 GARTH HE SUPPOSES YOU WILL NEVERTHINK WELL OF HIM AGAIN
I HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN FRED SAID MRS
 GARTH WITH DECISION
BUT I SHALL BE READY TO THINK WELL OF HIM AGAIN WHEN HE GIVES ME GOODREASON TO DO SO
AT THIS POINT MARY WENT OUT OF THE ROOM TAKING LETTY WITH HER
OH WE MUST FORGIVE YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN THEYRE SORRY SAID CALEBWATCHING MARY CLOSE THE DOOR
 AND AS YOU SAY MR
 FAREBROTHER THEREWAS THE VERY DEVIL IN THAT OLD MAN
 NOW MARYS GONE OUT I MUST TELLYOU A THINGITS ONLY KNOWN TO SUSAN AND ME AND YOULL NOT TELL ITAGAIN
 THE OLD SCOUNDREL WANTED MARY TO BURN ONE OF THE WILLS THE VERYNIGHT HE DIED WHEN SHE WAS SITTING UP WITH HIM BY HERSELF AND HEOFFERED HER A SUM OF MONEY THAT HE HAD IN THE BOX BY HIM IF SHE WOULDDO IT
 BUT MARY YOU UNDERSTAND COULD DO NO SUCH THINGWOULD NOT BEHANDLING HIS IRON CHEST AND SO ON
 NOW YOU SEE THE WILL HE WANTEDBURNT WAS THIS LAST SO THAT IF MARY HAD DONE WHAT HE WANTED FREDVINCY WOULD HAVE HAD TEN THOUSAND POUNDS
 THE OLD MAN DID TURN TO HIMAT THE LAST
 THAT TOUCHES POOR MARY CLOSE SHE COULDNT HELP ITSHE WASIN THE RIGHT TO DO WHAT SHE DID BUT SHE FEELS AS SHE SAYS MUCH AS IFSHE HAD KNOCKED DOWN SOMEBODYS PROPERTY AND BROKEN IT AGAINST HERWILL WHEN SHE WAS RIGHTFULLY DEFENDING HERSELF
 I FEEL WITH HERSOMEHOW AND IF I COULD MAKE ANY AMENDS TO THE POOR LAD INSTEAD OFBEARING HIM A GRUDGE FOR THE HARM HE DID US I SHOULD BE GLAD TO DO IT
NOW WHAT IS YOUR OPINION SIR
 SUSAN DOESNT AGREE WITH ME SHESAYSTELL WHAT YOU SAY SUSAN
MARY COULD NOT HAVE ACTED OTHERWISE EVEN IF SHE HAD KNOWN WHAT WOULDBE THE EFFECT ON FRED SAID MRS
 GARTH PAUSING FROM HER WORK ANDLOOKING AT MR
 FAREBROTHER
AND SHE WAS QUITE IGNORANT OF IT
 IT SEEMS TO ME A LOSS WHICH FALLSON ANOTHER BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE RIGHT IS NOT TO LIE UPON OURCONSCIENCE
THE VICAR DID NOT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY AND CALEB SAID ITS THEFEELING
 THE CHILD FEELS IN THAT WAY AND I FEEL WITH HER
 YOU DONTMEAN YOUR HORSE TO TREAD ON A DOG WHEN YOURE BACKING OUT OF THE WAYBUT IT GOES THROUGH YOU WHEN ITS DONE
I AM SURE MRS
 GARTH WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THERE SAID MR
FAREBROTHER WHO FOR SOME REASON SEEMED MORE INCLINED TO RUMINATE THANTO SPEAK
 ONE COULD HARDLY SAY THAT THE FEELING YOU MENTION ABOUT FREDIS WRONGOR RATHER MISTAKENTHOUGH NO MAN OUGHT TO MAKE A CLAIM ONSUCH FEELING
WELL WELL SAID CALEB ITS A SECRET
 YOU WILL NOT TELL FRED
CERTAINLY NOT
 BUT I SHALL CARRY THE OTHER GOOD NEWSTHAT YOU CANAFFORD THE LOSS HE CAUSED YOU
MR
 FAREBROTHER LEFT THE HOUSE SOON AFTER AND SEEING MARY IN THEORCHARD WITH LETTY WENT TO SAY GOODBY TO HER
 THEY MADE A PRETTYPICTURE IN THE WESTERN LIGHT WHICH BROUGHT OUT THE BRIGHTNESS OF THEAPPLES ON THE OLD SCANTLEAVED BOUGHSMARY IN HER LAVENDER GINGHAM ANDBLACK RIBBONS HOLDING A BASKET WHILE LETTY IN HER WELLWORN NANKINPICKED UP THE FALLEN APPLES
 IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE PARTICULARLY HOWMARY LOOKED TEN TO ONE YOU WILL SEE A FACE LIKE HERS IN THE CROWDEDSTREET TOMORROW IF YOU ARE THERE ON THE WATCH SHE WILL NOT BE AMONGTHOSE DAUGHTERS OF ZION WHO ARE HAUGHTY AND WALK WITH STRETCHEDOUTNECKS AND WANTON EYES MINCING AS THEY GO LET ALL THOSE PASS AND FIXYOUR EYES ON SOME SMALL PLUMP BROWNISH PERSON OF FIRM BUT QUIETCARRIAGE WHO LOOKS ABOUT HER BUT DOES NOT SUPPOSE THAT ANYBODY ISLOOKING AT HER
 IF SHE HAS A BROAD FACE AND SQUARE BROW WELLMARKEDEYEBROWS AND CURLY DARK HAIR A CERTAIN EXPRESSION OF AMUSEMENT IN HERGLANCE WHICH HER MOUTH KEEPS THE SECRET OF AND FOR THE REST FEATURESENTIRELY INSIGNIFICANTTAKE THAT ORDINARY BUT NOT DISAGREEABLE PERSONFOR A PORTRAIT OF MARY GARTH
 IF YOU MADE HER SMILE SHE WOULD SHOW YOUPERFECT LITTLE TEETH IF YOU MADE HER ANGRY SHE WOULD NOT RAISE HERVOICE BUT WOULD PROBABLY SAY ONE OF THE BITTEREST THINGS YOU HAVE EVERTASTED THE FLAVOR OF IF YOU DID HER A KINDNESS SHE WOULD NEVER FORGETIT
 MARY ADMIRED THE KEENFACED HANDSOME LITTLE VICAR IN HISWELLBRUSHED THREADBARE CLOTHES MORE THAN ANY MAN SHE HAD HAD THEOPPORTUNITY OF KNOWING
 SHE HAD NEVER HEARD HIM SAY A FOOLISH THINGTHOUGH SHE KNEW THAT HE DID UNWISE ONES AND PERHAPS FOOLISH SAYINGSWERE MORE OBJECTIONABLE TO HER THAN ANY OF MR
 FAREBROTHERS UNWISEDOINGS
 AT LEAST IT WAS REMARKABLE THAT THE ACTUAL IMPERFECTIONS OFTHE VICARS CLERICAL CHARACTER NEVER SEEMED TO CALL FORTH THE SAMESCORN AND DISLIKE WHICH SHE SHOWED BEFOREHAND FOR THE PREDICTEDIMPERFECTIONS OF THE CLERICAL CHARACTER SUSTAINED BY FRED VINCY
 THESEIRREGULARITIES OF JUDGMENT I IMAGINE ARE FOUND EVEN IN RIPER MINDSTHAN MARY GARTHS OUR IMPARTIALITY IS KEPT FOR ABSTRACT MERIT ANDDEMERIT WHICH NONE OF US EVER SAW
 WILL ANY ONE GUESS TOWARDS WHICH OFTHOSE WIDELY DIFFERENT MEN MARY HAD THE PECULIAR WOMANSTENDERNESS
THE ONE SHE WAS MOST INCLINED TO BE SEVERE ON OR THECONTRARY
HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR YOUR OLD PLAYFELLOW MISS GARTH
 SAID THEVICAR AS HE TOOK A FRAGRANT APPLE FROM THE BASKET WHICH SHE HELDTOWARDS HIM AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET
 SOMETHING TO SOFTEN DOWN THATHARSH JUDGMENT
 I AM GOING STRAIGHT TO SEE HIM
NO SAID MARY SHAKING HER HEAD AND SMILING
 IF I WERE TO SAY THATHE WOULD NOT BE RIDICULOUS AS A CLERGYMAN I MUST SAY THAT HE WOULD BESOMETHING WORSE THAN RIDICULOUS
 BUT I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT HE ISGOING AWAY TO WORK
ON THE OTHER HAND I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU ARE NOT GOINGAWAY TO WORK
 MY MOTHER I AM SURE WILL BE ALL THE HAPPIER IF YOU WILLCOME TO SEE HER AT THE VICARAGE YOU KNOW SHE IS FOND OF HAVING YOUNGPEOPLE TO TALK TO AND SHE HAS A GREAT DEAL TO TELL ABOUT OLD TIMES
YOU WILL REALLY BE DOING A KINDNESS
I SHOULD LIKE IT VERY MUCH IF I MAY SAID MARY
 EVERYTHING SEEMSTOO HAPPY FOR ME ALL AT ONCE
 I THOUGHT IT WOULD ALWAYS BE PART OF MYLIFE TO LONG FOR HOME AND LOSING THAT GRIEVANCE MAKES ME FEEL RATHEREMPTY I SUPPOSE IT SERVED INSTEAD OF SENSE TO FILL UP MY MIND
MAY I GO WITH YOU MARY
 WHISPERED LETTYA MOST INCONVENIENT CHILDWHO LISTENED TO EVERYTHING
 BUT SHE WAS MADE EXULTANT BY HAVING HERCHIN PINCHED AND HER CHEEK KISSED BY MR
 FAREBROTHERAN INCIDENT WHICHSHE NARRATED TO HER MOTHER AND FATHER
AS THE VICAR WALKED TO LOWICK ANY ONE WATCHING HIM CLOSELY MIGHT HAVESEEN HIM TWICE SHRUG HIS SHOULDERS
 I THINK THAT THE RARE ENGLISHMENWHO HAVE THIS GESTURE ARE NEVER OF THE HEAVY TYPEFOR FEAR OF ANYLUMBERING INSTANCE TO THE CONTRARY I WILL SAY HARDLY EVER THEY HAVEUSUALLY A FINE TEMPERAMENT AND MUCH TOLERANCE TOWARDS THE SMALLERERRORS OF MEN THEMSELVES INCLUSIVE
 THE VICAR WAS HOLDING AN INWARDDIALOGUE IN WHICH HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT THERE WAS PROBABLY SOMETHINGMORE BETWEEN FRED AND MARY GARTH THAN THE REGARD OF OLD PLAYFELLOWSAND REPLIED WITH A QUESTION WHETHER THAT BIT OF WOMANHOOD WERE NOT AGREAT DEAL TOO CHOICE FOR THAT CRUDE YOUNG GENTLEMAN
 THE REJOINDER TOTHIS WAS THE FIRST SHRUG
 THEN HE LAUGHED AT HIMSELF FOR BEING LIKELYTO HAVE FELT JEALOUS AS IF HE HAD BEEN A MAN ABLE TO MARRY WHICHADDED HE IT IS AS CLEAR AS ANY BALANCESHEET THAT I AM NOT
 WHEREUPONFOLLOWED THE SECOND SHRUG
WHAT COULD TWO MEN SO DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER SEE IN THIS BROWNPATCH AS MARY CALLED HERSELF
 IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT HER PLAINNESS THATATTRACTED THEM AND LET ALL PLAIN YOUNG LADIES BE WARNED AGAINST THEDANGEROUS ENCOURAGEMENT GIVEN THEM BY SOCIETY TO CONFIDE IN THEIR WANTOF BEAUTY
 A HUMAN BEING IN THIS AGED NATION OF OURS IS A VERYWONDERFUL WHOLE THE SLOW CREATION OF LONG INTERCHANGING INFLUENCESAND CHARM IS A RESULT OF TWO SUCH WHOLES THE ONE LOVING AND THE ONELOVED
WHEN MR
 AND MRS
 GARTH WERE SITTING ALONE CALEB SAID SUSAN GUESSWHAT IM THINKING OF
THE ROTATION OF CROPS SAID MRS
 GARTH SMILING AT HIM ABOVE HERKNITTING OR ELSE THE BACKDOORS OF THE TIPTON COTTAGES
NO SAID CALEB GRAVELY I AM THINKING THAT I COULD DO A GREAT TURNFOR FRED VINCY
 CHRISTYS GONE ALFRED WILL BE GONE SOON AND IT WILLBE FIVE YEARS BEFORE JIM IS READY TO TAKE TO BUSINESS
 I SHALL WANTHELP AND FRED MIGHT COME IN AND LEARN THE NATURE OF THINGS AND ACTUNDER ME AND IT MIGHT BE THE MAKING OF HIM INTO A USEFUL MAN IF HEGIVES UP BEING A PARSON
 WHAT DO YOU THINK
I THINK THERE IS HARDLY ANYTHING HONEST THAT HIS FAMILY WOULD OBJECTTO MORE SAID MRS
 GARTH DECIDEDLY
WHAT CARE I ABOUT THEIR OBJECTING
 SAID CALEB WITH A STURDINESSWHICH HE WAS APT TO SHOW WHEN HE HAD AN OPINION
 THE LAD IS OF AGE ANDMUST GET HIS BREAD
 HE HAS SENSE ENOUGH AND QUICKNESS ENOUGH HE LIKESBEING ON THE LAND AND ITS MY BELIEF THAT HE COULD LEARN BUSINESS WELLIF HE GAVE HIS MIND TO IT
BUT WOULD HE
 HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WANTED HIM TO BE A FINE GENTLEMANAND I THINK HE HAS THE SAME SORT OF FEELING HIMSELF
 THEY ALL THINK USBENEATH THEM
 AND IF THE PROPOSAL CAME FROM YOU I AM SURE MRS
 VINCYWOULD SAY THAT WE WANTED FRED FOR MARY
LIFE IS A POOR TALE IF IT IS TO BE SETTLED BY NONSENSE OF THAT SORTSAID CALEB WITH DISGUST
YES BUT THERE IS A CERTAIN PRIDE WHICH IS PROPER CALEB
I CALL IT IMPROPER PRIDE TO LET FOOLS NOTIONS HINDER YOU FROM DOING AGOOD ACTION
 THERES NO SORT OF WORK SAID CALEB WITH FERVOR PUTTINGOUT HIS HAND AND MOVING IT UP AND DOWN TO MARK HIS EMPHASIS THATCOULD EVER BE DONE WELL IF YOU MINDED WHAT FOOLS SAY
 YOU MUST HAVE ITINSIDE YOU THAT YOUR PLAN IS RIGHT AND THAT PLAN YOU MUST FOLLOW
I WILL NOT OPPOSE ANY PLAN YOU HAVE SET YOUR MIND ON CALEB SAIDMRS
 GARTH WHO WAS A FIRM WOMAN BUT KNEW THAT THERE WERE SOME POINTSON WHICH HER MILD HUSBAND WAS YET FIRMER
 STILL IT SEEMS TO BE FIXEDTHAT FRED IS TO GO BACK TO COLLEGE WILL IT NOT BE BETTER TO WAIT ANDSEE WHAT HE WILL CHOOSE TO DO AFTER THAT
 IT IS NOT EASY TO KEEP PEOPLEAGAINST THEIR WILL
 AND YOU ARE NOT YET QUITE SURE ENOUGH OF YOUR OWNPOSITION OR WHAT YOU WILL WANT
WELL IT MAY BE BETTER TO WAIT A BIT
 BUT AS TO MY GETTING PLENTY OFWORK FOR TWO IM PRETTY SURE OF THAT
 IVE ALWAYS HAD MY HANDS FULLWITH SCATTERED THINGS AND THERES ALWAYS SOMETHING FRESH TURNING UP
WHY ONLY YESTERDAYBLESS ME I DONT THINK I TOLD YOU
IT WAS RATHERODD THAT TWO MEN SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT ME ON DIFFERENT SIDES TO DO THESAME BIT OF VALUING
 AND WHO DO YOU THINK THEY WERE
 SAID CALEBTAKING A PINCH OF SNUFF AND HOLDING IT UP BETWEEN HIS FINGERS AS IF ITWERE A PART OF HIS EXPOSITION
 HE WAS FOND OF A PINCH WHEN IT OCCURREDTO HIM BUT HE USUALLY FORGOT THAT THIS INDULGENCE WAS AT HIS COMMAND
HIS WIFE HELD DOWN HER KNITTING AND LOOKED ATTENTIVE
WHY THAT RIGG OR RIGG FEATHERSTONE WAS ONE
 BUT BULSTRODE WASBEFORE HIM SO IM GOING TO DO IT FOR BULSTRODE
 WHETHER ITS MORTGAGEOR PURCHASE THEYRE GOING FOR I CANT TELL YET
CAN THAT MAN BE GOING TO SELL THE LAND JUST LEFT HIMWHICH HE HASTAKEN THE NAME FOR
 SAID MRS
 GARTH
DEUCE KNOWS SAID CALEB WHO NEVER REFERRED THE KNOWLEDGE OFDISCREDITABLE DOINGS TO ANY HIGHER POWER THAN THE DEUCE
 BUT BULSTRODEHAS LONG BEEN WANTING TO GET A HANDSOME BIT OF LAND UNDER HISFINGERSTHAT I KNOW
 AND ITS A DIFFICULT MATTER TO GET IN THIS PARTOF THE COUNTRY
CALEB SCATTERED HIS SNUFF CAREFULLY INSTEAD OF TAKING IT AND THENADDED THE INS AND OUTS OF THINGS ARE CURIOUS
 HERE IS THE LANDTHEYVE BEEN ALL ALONG EXPECTING FOR FRED WHICH IT SEEMS THE OLD MANNEVER MEANT TO LEAVE HIM A FOOT OF BUT LEFT IT TO THIS SIDESLIP OF ASON THAT HE KEPT IN THE DARK AND THOUGHT OF HIS STICKING THERE ANDVEXING EVERYBODY AS WELL AS HE COULD HAVE VEXED EM HIMSELF IF HE COULDHAVE KEPT ALIVE
 I SAY IT WOULD BE CURIOUS IF IT GOT INTO BULSTRODESHANDS AFTER ALL
 THE OLD MAN HATED HIM AND NEVER WOULD BANK WITH HIM
WHAT REASON COULD THE MISERABLE CREATURE HAVE FOR HATING A MAN WHOM HEHAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
 SAID MRS
 GARTH
POOH
 WHERES THE USE OF ASKING FOR SUCH FELLOWS REASONS
 THE SOUL OFMAN SAID CALEB WITH THE DEEP TONE AND GRAVE SHAKE OF THE HEAD WHICHALWAYS CAME WHEN HE USED THIS PHRASETHE SOUL OF MAN WHEN IT GETSFAIRLY ROTTEN WILL BEAR YOU ALL SORTS OF POISONOUS TOADSTOOLS AND NOEYE CAN SEE WHENCE CAME THE SEED THEREOF
IT WAS ONE OF CALEBS QUAINTNESSES THAT IN HIS DIFFICULTY OF FINDINGSPEECH FOR HIS THOUGHT HE CAUGHT AS IT WERE SNATCHES OF DICTIONWHICH HE ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS POINTS OF VIEW OR STATES OF MIND ANDWHENEVER HE HAD A FEELING OF AWE HE WAS HAUNTED BY A SENSE OF BIBLICALPHRASEOLOGY THOUGH HE COULD HARDLY HAVE GIVEN A STRICT QUOTATION
CHAPTER XLI
BY SWAGGERING COULD I NEVER THRIVEFOR THE RAIN IT RAINETH EVERY DAY
TWELFTH NIGHT
THE TRANSACTIONS REFERRED TO BY CALEB GARTH AS HAVING GONE FORWARDBETWEEN MR
 BULSTRODE AND MR
 JOSHUA RIGG FEATHERSTONE CONCERNING THELAND ATTACHED TO STONE COURT HAD OCCASIONED THE INTERCHANGE OF ALETTER OR TWO BETWEEN THESE PERSONAGES
WHO SHALL TELL WHAT MAY BE THE EFFECT OF WRITING
 IF IT HAPPENS TO HAVEBEEN CUT IN STONE THOUGH IT LIE FACE DOWNMOST FOR AGES ON A FORSAKENBEACH OR REST QUIETLY UNDER THE DRUMS AND TRAMPLINGS OF MANYCONQUESTS IT MAY END BY LETTING US INTO THE SECRET OF USURPATIONS ANDOTHER SCANDALS GOSSIPED ABOUT LONG EMPIRES AGOTHIS WORLD BEINGAPPARENTLY A HUGE WHISPERINGGALLERY
 SUCH CONDITIONS ARE OFTENMINUTELY REPRESENTED IN OUR PETTY LIFETIMES
 AS THE STONE WHICH HASBEEN KICKED BY GENERATIONS OF CLOWNS MAY COME BY CURIOUS LITTLE LINKSOF EFFECT UNDER THE EYES OF A SCHOLAR THROUGH WHOSE LABORS IT MAY ATLAST FIX THE DATE OF INVASIONS AND UNLOCK RELIGIONS SO A BIT OF INKAND PAPER WHICH HAS LONG BEEN AN INNOCENT WRAPPING OR STOPGAP MAY ATLAST BE LAID OPEN UNDER THE ONE PAIR OF EYES WHICH HAVE KNOWLEDGEENOUGH TO TURN IT INTO THE OPENING OF A CATASTROPHE
 TO URIEL WATCHINGTHE PROGRESS OF PLANETARY HISTORY FROM THE SUN THE ONE RESULT WOULD BEJUST AS MUCH OF A COINCIDENCE AS THE OTHER
HAVING MADE THIS RATHER LOFTY COMPARISON I AM LESS UNEASY IN CALLINGATTENTION TO THE EXISTENCE OF LOW PEOPLE BY WHOSE INTERFERENCE HOWEVERLITTLE WE MAY LIKE IT THE COURSE OF THE WORLD IS VERY MUCH DETERMINED
IT WOULD BE WELL CERTAINLY IF WE COULD HELP TO REDUCE THEIR NUMBERAND SOMETHING MIGHT PERHAPS BE DONE BY NOT LIGHTLY GIVING OCCASION TOTHEIR EXISTENCE
 SOCIALLY SPEAKING JOSHUA RIGG WOULD HAVE BEENGENERALLY PRONOUNCED A SUPERFLUITY
 BUT THOSE WHO LIKE PETERFEATHERSTONE NEVER HAD A COPY OF THEMSELVES DEMANDED ARE THE VERY LASTTO WAIT FOR SUCH A REQUEST EITHER IN PROSE OR VERSE
 THE COPY IN THISCASE BORE MORE OF OUTSIDE RESEMBLANCE TO THE MOTHER IN WHOSE SEXFROGFEATURES ACCOMPANIED WITH FRESHCOLORED CHEEKS AND A WELLROUNDEDFIGURE ARE COMPATIBLE WITH MUCH CHARM FOR A CERTAIN ORDER OF ADMIRERS
THE RESULT IS SOMETIMES A FROGFACED MALE DESIRABLE SURELY TO NOORDER OF INTELLIGENT BEINGS
 ESPECIALLY WHEN HE IS SUDDENLY BROUGHTINTO EVIDENCE TO FRUSTRATE OTHER PEOPLES EXPECTATIONSTHE VERY LOWESTASPECT IN WHICH A SOCIAL SUPERFLUITY CAN PRESENT HIMSELF
BUT MR
 RIGG FEATHERSTONES LOW CHARACTERISTICS WERE ALL OF THE SOBERWATERDRINKING KIND
 FROM THE EARLIEST TO THE LATEST HOUR OF THE DAY HEWAS ALWAYS AS SLEEK NEAT AND COOL AS THE FROG HE RESEMBLED AND OLDPETER HAD SECRETLY CHUCKLED OVER AN OFFSHOOT ALMOST MORE CALCULATINGAND FAR MORE IMPERTURBABLE THAN HIMSELF
 I WILL ADD THAT HISFINGERNAILS WERE SCRUPULOUSLY ATTENDED TO AND THAT HE MEANT TO MARRYA WELLEDUCATED YOUNG LADY AS YET UNSPECIFIED WHOSE PERSON WAS GOODAND WHOSE CONNECTIONS IN A SOLID MIDDLECLASS WAY WERE UNDENIABLE
THUS HIS NAILS AND MODESTY WERE COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF MOST GENTLEMENTHOUGH HIS AMBITION HAD BEEN EDUCATED ONLY BY THE OPPORTUNITIES OF ACLERK AND ACCOUNTANT IN THE SMALLER COMMERCIAL HOUSES OF A SEAPORT
 HETHOUGHT THE RURAL FEATHERSTONES VERY SIMPLE ABSURD PEOPLE AND THEY INTHEIR TURN REGARDED HIS BRINGING UP IN A SEAPORT TOWN AS ANEXAGGERATION OF THE MONSTROSITY THAT THEIR BROTHER PETER AND STILLMORE PETERS PROPERTY SHOULD HAVE HAD SUCH BELONGINGS
THE GARDEN AND GRAVEL APPROACH AS SEEN FROM THE TWO WINDOWS OF THEWAINSCOTED PARLOR AT STONE COURT WERE NEVER IN BETTER TRIM THAN NOWWHEN MR
 RIGG FEATHERSTONE STOOD WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM LOOKINGOUT ON THESE GROUNDS AS THEIR MASTER
 BUT IT SEEMED DOUBTFUL WHETHER HELOOKED OUT FOR THE SAKE OF CONTEMPLATION OR OF TURNING HIS BACK TO APERSON WHO STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WITH HIS LEGS CONSIDERABLYAPART AND HIS HANDS IN HIS TROUSERPOCKETS A PERSON IN ALL RESPECTS ACONTRAST TO THE SLEEK AND COOL RIGG
 HE WAS A MAN OBVIOUSLY ON THE WAYTOWARDS SIXTY VERY FLORID AND HAIRY WITH MUCH GRAY IN HIS BUSHYWHISKERS AND THICK CURLY HAIR A STOUTISH BODY WHICH SHOWED TODISADVANTAGE THE SOMEWHAT WORN JOININGS OF HIS CLOTHES AND THE AIR OFA SWAGGERER WHO WOULD AIM AT BEING NOTICEABLE EVEN AT A SHOW OFFIREWORKS REGARDING HIS OWN REMARKS ON ANY OTHER PERSONS PERFORMANCEAS LIKELY TO BE MORE INTERESTING THAN THE PERFORMANCE ITSELF

 AFTER HIS NAME AND THAT HERAFFLES ORIGINATED THE WITTICISM OF CALLING THAT CELEBRATED PRINCIPALBALAMB
 SUCH WERE THE APPEARANCE AND MENTAL FLAVOR OF MR
 RAFFLESBOTH OF WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE A STALE ODOR OF TRAVELLERS ROOMS IN THECOMMERCIAL HOTELS OF THAT PERIOD
COME NOW JOSH HE WAS SAYING IN A FULL RUMBLING TONE LOOK AT ITIN THIS LIGHT HERE IS YOUR POOR MOTHER GOING INTO THE VALE OF YEARSAND YOU COULD AFFORD SOMETHING HANDSOME NOW TO MAKE HER COMFORTABLE
NOT WHILE YOU LIVE
 NOTHING WOULD MAKE HER COMFORTABLE WHILE YOULIVE RETURNED RIGG IN HIS COOL HIGH VOICE
 WHAT I GIVE HER YOULLTAKE
YOU BEAR ME A GRUDGE JOSH THAT I KNOW
 BUT COME NOWAS BETWEEN MANAND MANWITHOUT HUMBUGA LITTLE CAPITAL MIGHT ENABLE ME TO MAKE AFIRSTRATE THING OF THE SHOP
 THE TOBACCO TRADE IS GROWING
 I SHOULDCUT MY OWN NOSE OFF IN NOT DOING THE BEST I COULD AT IT
 I SHOULD STICKTO IT LIKE A FLEA TO A FLEECE FOR MY OWN SAKE
 I SHOULD ALWAYS BE ONTHE SPOT
 AND NOTHING WOULD MAKE YOUR POOR MOTHER SO HAPPY
 IVE PRETTYWELL DONE WITH MY WILD OATSTURNED FIFTYFIVE
 I WANT TO SETTLE DOWN INMY CHIMNEYCORNER
 AND IF I ONCE BUCKLED TO THE TOBACCO TRADE I COULDBRING AN AMOUNT OF BRAINS AND EXPERIENCE TO BEAR ON IT THAT WOULD NOTBE FOUND ELSEWHERE IN A HURRY
 I DONT WANT TO BE BOTHERING YOU ONETIME AFTER ANOTHER BUT TO GET THINGS ONCE FOR ALL INTO THE RIGHTCHANNEL
 CONSIDER THAT JOSHAS BETWEEN MAN AND MANAND WITH YOUR POORMOTHER TO BE MADE EASY FOR HER LIFE
 I WAS ALWAYS FOND OF THE OLDWOMAN BY JOVE
HAVE YOU DONE
 SAID MR
 RIGG QUIETLY WITHOUT LOOKING AWAY FROM THEWINDOW
YES IVE DONE SAID RAFFLES TAKING HOLD OF HIS HAT WHICH STOODBEFORE HIM ON THE TABLE AND GIVING IT A SORT OF ORATORICAL PUSH
THEN JUST LISTEN TO ME
 THE MORE YOU SAY ANYTHING THE LESS I SHALLBELIEVE IT
 THE MORE YOU WANT ME TO DO A THING THE MORE REASON I SHALLHAVE FOR NEVER DOING IT
 DO YOU THINK I MEAN TO FORGET YOUR KICKING MEWHEN I WAS A LAD AND EATING ALL THE BEST VICTUAL AWAY FROM ME AND MYMOTHER
 DO YOU THINK I FORGET YOUR ALWAYS COMING HOME TO SELL ANDPOCKET EVERYTHING AND GOING OFF AGAIN LEAVING US IN THE LURCH
 ISHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE YOU WHIPPED AT THE CARTTAIL
 MY MOTHER WAS AFOOL TO YOU SHED NO RIGHT TO GIVE ME A FATHERINLAW AND SHES BEENPUNISHED FOR IT
 SHE SHALL HAVE HER WEEKLY ALLOWANCE PAID AND NO MOREAND THAT SHALL BE STOPPED IF YOU DARE TO COME ON TO THESE PREMISESAGAIN OR TO COME INTO THIS COUNTRY AFTER ME AGAIN
 THE NEXT TIME YOUSHOW YOURSELF INSIDE THE GATES HERE YOU SHALL BE DRIVEN OFF WITH THEDOGS AND THE WAGONERS WHIP
AS RIGG PRONOUNCED THE LAST WORDS HE TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED AT RAFFLESWITH HIS PROMINENT FROZEN EYES
 THE CONTRAST WAS AS STRIKING AS ITCOULD HAVE BEEN EIGHTEEN YEARS BEFORE WHEN RIGG WAS A MOST UNENGAGINGKICKABLE BOY AND RAFFLES WAS THE RATHER THICKSET ADONIS OF BARROOMSAND BACKPARLORS
 BUT THE ADVANTAGE NOW WAS ON THE SIDE OF RIGG ANDAUDITORS OF THIS CONVERSATION MIGHT PROBABLY HAVE EXPECTED THAT RAFFLESWOULD RETIRE WITH THE AIR OF A DEFEATED DOG
 NOT AT ALL
 HE MADE AGRIMACE WHICH WAS HABITUAL WITH HIM WHENEVER HE WAS OUT IN A GAMETHEN SUBSIDED INTO A LAUGH AND DREW A BRANDYFLASK FROM HIS POCKET
COME JOSH HE SAID IN A CAJOLING TONE GIVE US A SPOONFUL OFBRANDY AND A SOVEREIGN TO PAY THE WAY BACK AND ILL GO
 HONOR BRIGHT
ILL GO LIKE A BULLET BY JOVE
MIND SAID RIGG DRAWING OUT A BUNCH OF KEYS IF I EVER SEE YOUAGAIN I SHANT SPEAK TO YOU
 I DONT OWN YOU ANY MORE THAN IF I SAW ACROW AND IF YOU WANT TO OWN ME YOULL GET NOTHING BY IT BUT ACHARACTER FOR BEING WHAT YOU AREA SPITEFUL BRASSY BULLYING ROGUE
THATS A PITY NOW JOSH SAID RAFFLES AFFECTING TO SCRATCH HIS HEADAND WRINKLE HIS BROWS UPWARD AS IF HE WERE NONPLUSSED
 IM VERY FONDOF YOU BY JOVE I AM
 THERES NOTHING I LIKE BETTER THAN PLAGUINGYOUYOURE SO LIKE YOUR MOTHER AND I MUST DO WITHOUT IT
 BUT THEBRANDY AND THE SOVEREIGNS A BARGAIN
HE JERKED FORWARD THE FLASK AND RIGG WENT TO A FINE OLD OAKEN BUREAUWITH HIS KEYS
 BUT RAFFLES HAD REMINDED HIMSELF BY HIS MOVEMENT WITHTHE FLASK THAT IT HAD BECOME DANGEROUSLY LOOSE FROM ITS LEATHERCOVERING AND CATCHING SIGHT OF A FOLDED PAPER WHICH HAD FALLEN WITHINTHE FENDER HE TOOK IT UP AND SHOVED IT UNDER THE LEATHER SO AS TO MAKETHE GLASS FIRM
BY THAT TIME RIGG CAME FORWARD WITH A BRANDYBOTTLE FILLED THE FLASKAND HANDED RAFFLES A SOVEREIGN NEITHER LOOKING AT HIM NOR SPEAKING TOHIM
 AFTER LOCKING UP THE BUREAU AGAIN HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW ANDGAZED OUT AS IMPASSIBLY AS HE HAD DONE AT THE BEGINNING OF THEINTERVIEW WHILE RAFFLES TOOK A SMALL ALLOWANCE FROM THE FLASK SCREWEDIT UP AND DEPOSITED IT IN HIS SIDEPOCKET WITH PROVOKING SLOWNESSMAKING A GRIMACE AT HIS STEPSONS BACK
FAREWELL JOSHAND IF FOREVER
 SAID RAFFLES TURNING BACK HIS HEAD ASHE OPENED THE DOOR
RIGG SAW HIM LEAVE THE GROUNDS AND ENTER THE LANE
 THE GRAY DAY HADTURNED TO A LIGHT DRIZZLING RAIN WHICH FRESHENED THE HEDGEROWS AND THEGRASSY BORDERS OF THE BYROADS AND HASTENED THE LABORERS WHO WERELOADING THE LAST SHOCKS OF CORN
 RAFFLES WALKING WITH THE UNEASY GAITOF A TOWN LOITERER OBLIGED TO DO A BIT OF COUNTRY JOURNEYING ON FOOTLOOKED AS INCONGRUOUS AMID THIS MOIST RURAL QUIET AND INDUSTRY AS IF HEHAD BEEN A BABOON ESCAPED FROM A MENAGERIE
 BUT THERE WERE NONE TOSTARE AT HIM EXCEPT THE LONGWEANED CALVES AND NONE TO SHOW DISLIKE OFHIS APPEARANCE EXCEPT THE LITTLE WATERRATS WHICH RUSTLED AWAY AT HISAPPROACH
HE WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH WHEN HE GOT ON TO THE HIGHROAD TO BE OVERTAKENBY THE STAGECOACH WHICH CARRIED HIM TO BRASSING AND THERE HE TOOKTHE NEWMADE RAILWAY OBSERVING TO HIS FELLOWPASSENGERS THAT HECONSIDERED IT PRETTY WELL SEASONED NOW IT HAD DONE FOR HUSKISSON
 MR
RAFFLES ON MOST OCCASIONS KEPT UP THE SENSE OF HAVING BEEN EDUCATED ATAN ACADEMY AND BEING ABLE IF HE CHOSE TO PASS WELL EVERYWHEREINDEED THERE WAS NOT ONE OF HIS FELLOWMEN WHOM HE DID NOT FEELHIMSELF IN A POSITION TO RIDICULE AND TORMENT CONFIDENT OF THEENTERTAINMENT WHICH HE THUS GAVE TO ALL THE REST OF THE COMPANY
HE PLAYED THIS PART NOW WITH AS MUCH SPIRIT AS IF HIS JOURNEY HAD BEENENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL RESORTING AT FREQUENT INTERVALS TO HIS FLASK
 THEPAPER WITH WHICH HE HAD WEDGED IT WAS A LETTER SIGNED NICHOLASBULSTRODE BUT RAFFLES WAS NOT LIKELY TO DISTURB IT FROM ITS PRESENTUSEFUL POSITION
CHAPTER XLII
HOW MUCH METHINKS I COULD DESPISE THIS MANWERE I NOT BOUND IN CHARITY AGAINST IT
SHAKESPEARE HENRY VIII
ONE OF THE PROFESSIONAL CALLS MADE BY LYDGATE SOON AFTER HIS RETURNFROM HIS WEDDINGJOURNEY WAS TO LOWICK MANOR IN CONSEQUENCE OF ALETTER WHICH HAD REQUESTED HIM TO FIX A TIME FOR HIS VISIT
MR
 CASAUBON HAD NEVER PUT ANY QUESTION CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HISILLNESS TO LYDGATE NOR HAD HE EVEN TO DOROTHEA BETRAYED ANY ANXIETY ASTO HOW FAR IT MIGHT BE LIKELY TO CUT SHORT HIS LABORS OR HIS LIFE
 ONTHIS POINT AS ON ALL OTHERS HE SHRANK FROM PITY AND IF THE SUSPICIONOF BEING PITIED FOR ANYTHING IN HIS LOT SURMISED OR KNOWN IN SPITE OFHIMSELF WAS EMBITTERING THE IDEA OF CALLING FORTH A SHOW OF COMPASSIONBY FRANKLY ADMITTING AN ALARM OR A SORROW WAS NECESSARILY INTOLERABLETO HIM
 EVERY PROUD MIND KNOWS SOMETHING OF THIS EXPERIENCE ANDPERHAPS IT IS ONLY TO BE OVERCOME BY A SENSE OF FELLOWSHIP DEEP ENOUGHTO MAKE ALL EFFORTS AT ISOLATION SEEM MEAN AND PETTY INSTEAD OFEXALTING
BUT MR
 CASAUBON WAS NOW BROODING OVER SOMETHING THROUGH WHICH THEQUESTION OF HIS HEALTH AND LIFE HAUNTED HIS SILENCE WITH A MOREHARASSING IMPORTUNITY EVEN THAN THROUGH THE AUTUMNAL UNRIPENESS OF HISAUTHORSHIP
 IT IS TRUE THAT THIS LAST MIGHT BE CALLED HIS CENTRALAMBITION BUT THERE ARE SOME KINDS OF AUTHORSHIP IN WHICH BY FAR THELARGEST RESULT IS THE UNEASY SUSCEPTIBILITY ACCUMULATED IN THECONSCIOUSNESS OF THE AUTHORONE KNOWS OF THE RIVER BY A FEW STREAKSAMID A LONGGATHERED DEPOSIT OF UNCOMFORTABLE MUD
 THAT WAS THE WAYWITH MR
 CASAUBONS HARD INTELLECTUAL LABORS
 THEIR MOST CHARACTERISTICRESULT WAS NOT THE KEY TO ALL MYTHOLOGIES BUT A MORBID CONSCIOUSNESSTHAT OTHERS DID NOT GIVE HIM THE PLACE WHICH HE HAD NOT DEMONSTRABLYMERITEDA PERPETUAL SUSPICIOUS CONJECTURE THAT THE VIEWS ENTERTAINED OFHIM WERE NOT TO HIS ADVANTAGEA MELANCHOLY ABSENCE OF PASSION IN HISEFFORTS AT ACHIEVEMENT AND A PASSIONATE RESISTANCE TO THE CONFESSIONTHAT HE HAD ACHIEVED NOTHING
THUS HIS INTELLECTUAL AMBITION WHICH SEEMED TO OTHERS TO HAVE ABSORBEDAND DRIED HIM WAS REALLY NO SECURITY AGAINST WOUNDS LEAST OF ALLAGAINST THOSE WHICH CAME FROM DOROTHEA
 AND HE HAD BEGUN NOW TO FRAMEPOSSIBILITIES FOR THE FUTURE WHICH WERE SOMEHOW MORE EMBITTERING TO HIMTHAN ANYTHING HIS MIND HAD DWELT ON BEFORE
AGAINST CERTAIN FACTS HE WAS HELPLESS AGAINST WILL LADISLAWSEXISTENCE HIS DEFIANT STAY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF LOWICK AND HISFLIPPANT STATE OF MIND WITH REGARD TO THE POSSESSORS OF AUTHENTICWELLSTAMPED ERUDITION AGAINST DOROTHEAS NATURE ALWAYS TAKING ONSOME NEW SHAPE OF ARDENT ACTIVITY AND EVEN IN SUBMISSION AND SILENCECOVERING FERVID REASONS WHICH IT WAS AN IRRITATION TO THINK OF AGAINSTCERTAIN NOTIONS AND LIKINGS WHICH HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER MIND INRELATION TO SUBJECTS THAT HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY DISCUSS WITH HER
 THEREWAS NO DENYING THAT DOROTHEA WAS AS VIRTUOUS AND LOVELY A YOUNG LADY ASHE COULD HAVE OBTAINED FOR A WIFE BUT A YOUNG LADY TURNED OUT TO BESOMETHING MORE TROUBLESOME THAN HE HAD CONCEIVED
 SHE NURSED HIM SHEREAD TO HIM SHE ANTICIPATED HIS WANTS AND WAS SOLICITOUS ABOUT HISFEELINGS BUT THERE HAD ENTERED INTO THE HUSBANDS MIND THE CERTAINTYTHAT SHE JUDGED HIM AND THAT HER WIFELY DEVOTEDNESS WAS LIKE APENITENTIAL EXPIATION OF UNBELIEVING THOUGHTSWAS ACCOMPANIED WITH APOWER OF COMPARISON BY WHICH HIMSELF AND HIS DOINGS WERE SEEN TOOLUMINOUSLY AS A PART OF THINGS IN GENERAL
 HIS DISCONTENT PASSEDVAPORLIKE THROUGH ALL HER GENTLE LOVING MANIFESTATIONS AND CLUNG TOTHAT INAPPRECIATIVE WORLD WHICH SHE HAD ONLY BROUGHT NEARER TO HIM
POOR MR
 CASAUBON
 THIS SUFFERING WAS THE HARDER TO BEAR BECAUSE ITSEEMED LIKE A BETRAYAL THE YOUNG CREATURE WHO HAD WORSHIPPED HIM WITHPERFECT TRUST HAD QUICKLY TURNED INTO THE CRITICAL WIFE AND EARLYINSTANCES OF CRITICISM AND RESENTMENT HAD MADE AN IMPRESSION WHICH NOTENDERNESS AND SUBMISSION AFTERWARDS COULD REMOVE
 TO HIS SUSPICIOUSINTERPRETATION DOROTHEAS SILENCE NOW WAS A SUPPRESSED REBELLION AREMARK FROM HER WHICH HE HAD NOT IN ANY WAY ANTICIPATED WAS ANASSERTION OF CONSCIOUS SUPERIORITY HER GENTLE ANSWERS HAD ANIRRITATING CAUTIOUSNESS IN THEM AND WHEN SHE ACQUIESCED IT WAS ASELFAPPROVED EFFORT OF FORBEARANCE
 THE TENACITY WITH WHICH HE STROVETO HIDE THIS INWARD DRAMA MADE IT THE MORE VIVID FOR HIM AS WE HEARWITH THE MORE KEENNESS WHAT WE WISH OTHERS NOT TO HEAR
INSTEAD OF WONDERING AT THIS RESULT OF MISERY IN MR
 CASAUBON I THINKIT QUITE ORDINARY
 WILL NOT A TINY SPECK VERY CLOSE TO OUR VISION BLOTOUT THE GLORY OF THE WORLD AND LEAVE ONLY A MARGIN BY WHICH WE SEE THEBLOT
 I KNOW NO SPECK SO TROUBLESOME AS SELF
 AND WHO IF MR
 CASAUBONHAD CHOSEN TO EXPOUND HIS DISCONTENTSHIS SUSPICIONS THAT HE WAS NOTANY LONGER ADORED WITHOUT CRITICISMCOULD HAVE DENIED THAT THEY WEREFOUNDED ON GOOD REASONS
 ON THE CONTRARY THERE WAS A STRONG REASON TOBE ADDED WHICH HE HAD NOT HIMSELF TAKEN EXPLICITLY INTOACCOUNTNAMELY THAT HE WAS NOT UNMIXEDLY ADORABLE
 HE SUSPECTED THISHOWEVER AS HE SUSPECTED OTHER THINGS WITHOUT CONFESSING IT AND LIKETHE REST OF US FELT HOW SOOTHING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO HAVE ACOMPANION WHO WOULD NEVER FIND IT OUT
THIS SORE SUSCEPTIBILITY IN RELATION TO DOROTHEA WAS THOROUGHLYPREPARED BEFORE WILL LADISLAW HAD RETURNED TO LOWICK AND WHAT HADOCCURRED SINCE THEN HAD BROUGHT MR
 CASAUBONS POWER OF SUSPICIOUSCONSTRUCTION INTO EXASPERATED ACTIVITY
 TO ALL THE FACTS WHICH HE KNEWHE ADDED IMAGINARY FACTS BOTH PRESENT AND FUTURE WHICH BECAME MORE REALTO HIM THAN THOSE BECAUSE THEY CALLED UP A STRONGER DISLIKE A MOREPREDOMINATING BITTERNESS
 SUSPICION AND JEALOUSY OF WILL LADISLAWSINTENTIONS SUSPICION AND JEALOUSY OF DOROTHEAS IMPRESSIONS WERECONSTANTLY AT THEIR WEAVING WORK
 IT WOULD BE QUITE UNJUST TO HIM TOSUPPOSE THAT HE COULD HAVE ENTERED INTO ANY COARSE MISINTERPRETATION OFDOROTHEA HIS OWN HABITS OF MIND AND CONDUCT QUITE AS MUCH AS THE OPENELEVATION OF HER NATURE SAVED HIM FROM ANY SUCH MISTAKE
 WHAT HE WASJEALOUS OF WAS HER OPINION THE SWAY THAT MIGHT BE GIVEN TO HER ARDENTMIND IN ITS JUDGMENTS AND THE FUTURE POSSIBILITIES TO WHICH THESEMIGHT LEAD HER
 AS TO WILL THOUGH UNTIL HIS LAST DEFIANT LETTER HE HADNOTHING DEFINITE WHICH HE WOULD CHOOSE FORMALLY TO ALLEGE AGAINST HIMHE FELT HIMSELF WARRANTED IN BELIEVING THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF ANYDESIGN WHICH COULD FASCINATE A REBELLIOUS TEMPER AND AN UNDISCIPLINEDIMPULSIVENESS
 HE WAS QUITE SURE THAT DOROTHEA WAS THE CAUSE OF WILLSRETURN FROM ROME AND HIS DETERMINATION TO SETTLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODAND HE WAS PENETRATING ENOUGH TO IMAGINE THAT DOROTHEA HAD INNOCENTLYENCOURAGED THIS COURSE
 IT WAS AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE THAT SHE WAS READYTO BE ATTACHED TO WILL AND TO BE PLIANT TO HIS SUGGESTIONS THEY HADNEVER HAD A TÊTEÀTÊTE WITHOUT HER BRINGING AWAY FROM IT SOME NEWTROUBLESOME IMPRESSION AND THE LAST INTERVIEW THAT MR
 CASAUBON WASAWARE OF DOROTHEA ON RETURNING FROM FRESHITT HALL HAD FOR THE FIRSTTIME BEEN SILENT ABOUT HAVING SEEN WILL HAD LED TO A SCENE WHICHROUSED AN ANGRIER FEELING AGAINST THEM BOTH THAN HE HAD EVER KNOWNBEFORE
 DOROTHEAS OUTPOURING OF HER NOTIONS ABOUT MONEY IN THEDARKNESS OF THE NIGHT HAD DONE NOTHING BUT BRING A MIXTURE OF MOREODIOUS FOREBODING INTO HER HUSBANDS MIND
AND THERE WAS THE SHOCK LATELY GIVEN TO HIS HEALTH ALWAYS SADLY PRESENTWITH HIM
 HE WAS CERTAINLY MUCH REVIVED HE HAD RECOVERED ALL HIS USUALPOWER OF WORK THE ILLNESS MIGHT HAVE BEEN MERE FATIGUE AND THEREMIGHT STILL BE TWENTY YEARS OF ACHIEVEMENT BEFORE HIM WHICH WOULDJUSTIFY THE THIRTY YEARS OF PREPARATION
 THAT PROSPECT WAS MADE THESWEETER BY A FLAVOR OF VENGEANCE AGAINST THE HASTY SNEERS OF CARP COMPANY FOR EVEN WHEN MR
 CASAUBON WAS CARRYING HIS TAPER AMONG THETOMBS OF THE PAST THOSE MODERN FIGURES CAME ATHWART THE DIM LIGHT ANDINTERRUPTED HIS DILIGENT EXPLORATION
 TO CONVINCE CARP OF HIS MISTAKESO THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO EAT HIS OWN WORDS WITH A GOOD DEAL OFINDIGESTION WOULD BE AN AGREEABLE ACCIDENT OF TRIUMPHANT AUTHORSHIPWHICH THE PROSPECT OF LIVING TO FUTURE AGES ON EARTH AND TO ALLETERNITY IN HEAVEN COULD NOT EXCLUDE FROM CONTEMPLATION
 SINCE THUSTHE PREVISION OF HIS OWN UNENDING BLISS COULD NOT NULLIFY THE BITTERSAVORS OF IRRITATED JEALOUSY AND VINDICTIVENESS IT IS THE LESSSURPRISING THAT THE PROBABILITY OF A TRANSIENT EARTHLY BLISS FOR OTHERPERSONS WHEN HE HIMSELF SHOULD HAVE ENTERED INTO GLORY HAD NOT APOTENTLY SWEETENING EFFECT
 IF THE TRUTH SHOULD BE THAT SOMEUNDERMINING DISEASE WAS AT WORK WITHIN HIM THERE MIGHT BE LARGEOPPORTUNITY FOR SOME PEOPLE TO BE THE HAPPIER WHEN HE WAS GONE AND IFONE OF THOSE PEOPLE SHOULD BE WILL LADISLAW MR
 CASAUBON OBJECTED SOSTRONGLY THAT IT SEEMED AS IF THE ANNOYANCE WOULD MAKE PART OF HISDISEMBODIED EXISTENCE
THIS IS A VERY BARE AND THEREFORE A VERY INCOMPLETE WAY OF PUTTING THECASE
 THE HUMAN SOUL MOVES IN MANY CHANNELS AND MR
 CASAUBON WE KNOWHAD A SENSE OF RECTITUDE AND AN HONORABLE PRIDE IN SATISFYING THEREQUIREMENTS OF HONOR WHICH COMPELLED HIM TO FIND OTHER REASONS FORHIS CONDUCT THAN THOSE OF JEALOUSY AND VINDICTIVENESS
 THE WAY IN WHICHMR
 CASAUBON PUT THE CASE WAS THISIN MARRYING DOROTHEA BROOKE I HADTO CARE FOR HER WELLBEING IN CASE OF MY DEATH
 BUT WELLBEING IS NOTTO BE SECURED BY AMPLE INDEPENDENT POSSESSION OF PROPERTY ON THECONTRARY OCCASIONS MIGHT ARISE IN WHICH SUCH POSSESSION MIGHT EXPOSEHER TO THE MORE DANGER
 SHE IS READY PREY TO ANY MAN WHO KNOWS HOW TOPLAY ADROITLY EITHER ON HER AFFECTIONATE ARDOR OR HER QUIXOTICENTHUSIASM AND A MAN STANDS BY WITH THAT VERY INTENTION IN HIS MINDAMAN WITH NO OTHER PRINCIPLE THAN TRANSIENT CAPRICE AND WHO HAS APERSONAL ANIMOSITY TOWARDS MEI AM SURE OF ITAN ANIMOSITY WHICH IS FEDBY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS INGRATITUDE AND WHICH HE HAS CONSTANTLYVENTED IN RIDICULE OF WHICH I AM AS WELL ASSURED AS IF I HAD HEARD IT
EVEN IF I LIVE I SHALL NOT BE WITHOUT UNEASINESS AS TO WHAT HE MAYATTEMPT THROUGH INDIRECT INFLUENCE
 THIS MAN HAS GAINED DOROTHEAS EARHE HAS FASCINATED HER ATTENTION HE HAS EVIDENTLY TRIED TO IMPRESS HERMIND WITH THE NOTION THAT HE HAS CLAIMS BEYOND ANYTHING I HAVE DONE FORHIM
 IF I DIEAND HE IS WAITING HERE ON THE WATCH FOR THATHE WILLPERSUADE HER TO MARRY HIM
 THAT WOULD BE CALAMITY FOR HER AND SUCCESSFOR HIM
 SHE WOULD NOT THINK IT CALAMITY HE WOULD MAKE HER BELIEVEANYTHING SHE HAS A TENDENCY TO IMMODERATE ATTACHMENT WHICH SHEINWARDLY REPROACHES ME FOR NOT RESPONDING TO AND ALREADY HER MIND ISOCCUPIED WITH HIS FORTUNES
 HE THINKS OF AN EASY CONQUEST AND OFENTERING INTO MY NEST
 THAT I WILL HINDER
 SUCH A MARRIAGE WOULD BEFATAL TO DOROTHEA
 HAS HE EVER PERSISTED IN ANYTHING EXCEPT FROMCONTRADICTION
 IN KNOWLEDGE HE HAS ALWAYS TRIED TO BE SHOWY AT SMALLCOST
 IN RELIGION HE COULD BE AS LONG AS IT SUITED HIM THE FACILEECHO OF DOROTHEAS VAGARIES
 WHEN WAS SCIOLISM EVER DISSOCIATED FROMLAXITY
 I UTTERLY DISTRUST HIS MORALS AND IT IS MY DUTY TO HINDER TOTHE UTMOST THE FULFILMENT OF HIS DESIGNS
THE ARRANGEMENTS MADE BY MR
 CASAUBON ON HIS MARRIAGE LEFT STRONGMEASURES OPEN TO HIM BUT IN RUMINATING ON THEM HIS MIND INEVITABLYDWELT SO MUCH ON THE PROBABILITIES OF HIS OWN LIFE THAT THE LONGING TOGET THE NEAREST POSSIBLE CALCULATION HAD AT LAST OVERCOME HIS PROUDRETICENCE AND HAD DETERMINED HIM TO ASK LYDGATES OPINION AS TO THENATURE OF HIS ILLNESS
HE HAD MENTIONED TO DOROTHEA THAT LYDGATE WAS COMING BY APPOINTMENT ATHALFPAST THREE AND IN ANSWER TO HER ANXIOUS QUESTION WHETHER HE HADFELT ILL REPLIEDNO I MERELY WISH TO HAVE HIS OPINION CONCERNINGSOME HABITUAL SYMPTOMS
 YOU NEED NOT SEE HIM MY DEAR
 I SHALL GIVEORDERS THAT HE MAY BE SENT TO ME IN THE YEWTREE WALK WHERE I SHALL BETAKING MY USUAL EXERCISE
WHEN LYDGATE ENTERED THE YEWTREE WALK HE SAW MR
 CASAUBON SLOWLYRECEDING WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM ACCORDING TO HIS HABIT AND HIS HEADBENT FORWARD
 IT WAS A LOVELY AFTERNOON THE LEAVES FROM THE LOFTYLIMES WERE FALLING SILENTLY ACROSS THE SOMBRE EVERGREENS WHILE THELIGHTS AND SHADOWS SLEPT SIDE BY SIDE THERE WAS NO SOUND BUT THECAWING OF THE ROOKS WHICH TO THE ACCUSTOMED EAR IS A LULLABY OR THATLAST SOLEMN LULLABY A DIRGE
 LYDGATE CONSCIOUS OF AN ENERGETIC FRAMEIN ITS PRIME FELT SOME COMPASSION WHEN THE FIGURE WHICH HE WAS LIKELYSOON TO OVERTAKE TURNED ROUND AND IN ADVANCING TOWARDS HIM SHOWED MOREMARKEDLY THAN EVER THE SIGNS OF PREMATURE AGETHE STUDENTS BENTSHOULDERS THE EMACIATED LIMBS AND THE MELANCHOLY LINES OF THE MOUTH
POOR FELLOW HE THOUGHT SOME MEN WITH HIS YEARS ARE LIKE LIONS ONECAN TELL NOTHING OF THEIR AGE EXCEPT THAT THEY ARE FULL GROWN
MR
 LYDGATE SAID MR
 CASAUBON WITH HIS INVARIABLY POLITE AIR I AMEXCEEDINGLY OBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR PUNCTUALITY
 WE WILL IF YOUPLEASE CARRY ON OUR CONVERSATION IN WALKING TO AND FRO
I HOPE YOUR WISH TO SEE ME IS NOT DUE TO THE RETURN OF UNPLEASANTSYMPTOMS SAID LYDGATE FILLING UP A PAUSE
NOT IMMEDIATELYNO
 IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT WISH I MUSTMENTIONWHAT IT WERE OTHERWISE NEEDLESS TO REFER TOTHAT MY LIFE ONALL COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS INSIGNIFICANT DERIVES A POSSIBLE IMPORTANCEFROM THE INCOMPLETENESS OF LABORS WHICH HAVE EXTENDED THROUGH ALL ITSBEST YEARS
 IN SHORT I HAVE LONG HAD ON HAND A WORK WHICH I WOULD FAINLEAVE BEHIND ME IN SUCH A STATE AT LEAST THAT IT MIGHT BE COMMITTEDTO THE PRESS BYOTHERS
 WERE I ASSURED THAT THIS IS THE UTMOST I CANREASONABLY EXPECT THAT ASSURANCE WOULD BE A USEFUL CIRCUMSCRIPTION OFMY ATTEMPTS AND A GUIDE IN BOTH THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVEDETERMINATION OF MY COURSE
HERE MR
 CASAUBON PAUSED REMOVED ONE HAND FROM HIS BACK AND THRUST ITBETWEEN THE BUTTONS OF HIS SINGLEBREASTED COAT
 TO A MIND LARGELYINSTRUCTED IN THE HUMAN DESTINY HARDLY ANYTHING COULD BE MOREINTERESTING THAN THE INWARD CONFLICT IMPLIED IN HIS FORMAL MEASUREDADDRESS DELIVERED WITH THE USUAL SINGSONG AND MOTION OF THE HEAD
NAY ARE THERE MANY SITUATIONS MORE SUBLIMELY TRAGIC THAN THE STRUGGLEOF THE SOUL WITH THE DEMAND TO RENOUNCE A WORK WHICH HAS BEEN ALL THESIGNIFICANCE OF ITS LIFEA SIGNIFICANCE WHICH IS TO VANISH AS THEWATERS WHICH COME AND GO WHERE NO MAN HAS NEED OF THEM
 BUT THERE WASNOTHING TO STRIKE OTHERS AS SUBLIME ABOUT MR
 CASAUBON AND LYDGATEWHO HAD SOME CONTEMPT AT HAND FOR FUTILE SCHOLARSHIP FELT A LITTLEAMUSEMENT MINGLING WITH HIS PITY
 HE WAS AT PRESENT TOO ILL ACQUAINTEDWITH DISASTER TO ENTER INTO THE PATHOS OF A LOT WHERE EVERYTHING ISBELOW THE LEVEL OF TRAGEDY EXCEPT THE PASSIONATE EGOISM OF THESUFFERER
YOU REFER TO THE POSSIBLE HINDRANCES FROM WANT OF HEALTH
 HE SAIDWISHING TO HELP FORWARD MR
 CASAUBONS PURPOSE WHICH SEEMED TO BECLOGGED BY SOME HESITATION
I DO
 YOU HAVE NOT IMPLIED TO ME THAT THE SYMPTOMS WHICHI AM BOUND TOTESTIFYYOU WATCHED WITH SCRUPULOUS CARE WERE THOSE OF A FATALDISEASE
 BUT WERE IT SO MR
 LYDGATE I SHOULD DESIRE TO KNOW THE TRUTHWITHOUT RESERVATION AND I APPEAL TO YOU FOR AN EXACT STATEMENT OF YOURCONCLUSIONS I REQUEST IT AS A FRIENDLY SERVICE
 IF YOU CAN TELL METHAT MY LIFE IS NOT THREATENED BY ANYTHING ELSE THAN ORDINARYCASUALTIES I SHALL REJOICE ON GROUNDS WHICH I HAVE ALREADY INDICATED
IF NOT KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO ME
THEN I CAN NO LONGER HESITATE AS TO MY COURSE SAID LYDGATE BUT THEFIRST THING I MUST IMPRESS ON YOU IS THAT MY CONCLUSIONS ARE DOUBLYUNCERTAINUNCERTAIN NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF MY FALLIBILITY BUT BECAUSEDISEASES OF THE HEART ARE EMINENTLY DIFFICULT TO FOUND PREDICTIONS ON
IN ANY CASE ONE CAN HARDLY INCREASE APPRECIABLY THE TREMENDOUSUNCERTAINTY OF LIFE
MR
 CASAUBON WINCED PERCEPTIBLY BUT BOWED
I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM WHAT IS CALLED FATTYDEGENERATION OF THE HEART A DISEASE WHICH WAS FIRST DIVINED ANDEXPLORED BY LAENNEC THE MAN WHO GAVE US THE STETHOSCOPE NOT SO VERYMANY YEARS AGO
 A GOOD DEAL OF EXPERIENCEA MORE LENGTHENEDOBSERVATIONIS WANTING ON THE SUBJECT
 BUT AFTER WHAT YOU HAVE SAID ITIS MY DUTY TO TELL YOU THAT DEATH FROM THIS DISEASE IS OFTEN SUDDEN
 ATTHE SAME TIME NO SUCH RESULT CAN BE PREDICTED
 YOUR CONDITION MAY BECONSISTENT WITH A TOLERABLY COMFORTABLE LIFE FOR ANOTHER FIFTEEN YEARSOR EVEN MORE
 I COULD ADD NO INFORMATION TO THIS BEYOND ANATOMICAL ORMEDICAL DETAILS WHICH WOULD LEAVE EXPECTATION AT PRECISELY THE SAMEPOINT
 LYDGATES INSTINCT WAS FINE ENOUGH TO TELL HIM THAT PLAINSPEECH QUITE FREE FROM OSTENTATIOUS CAUTION WOULD BE FELT BY MR
CASAUBON AS A TRIBUTE OF RESPECT
I THANK YOU MR
 LYDGATE SAID MR
 CASAUBON AFTER A MOMENTS PAUSE
ONE THING MORE I HAVE STILL TO ASK DID YOU COMMUNICATE WHAT YOU HAVENOW TOLD ME TO MRS
 CASAUBON
PARTLYI MEAN AS TO THE POSSIBLE ISSUES
 LYDGATE WAS GOING TOEXPLAIN WHY HE HAD TOLD DOROTHEA BUT MR
 CASAUBON WITH ANUNMISTAKABLE DESIRE TO END THE CONVERSATION WAVED HIS HAND SLIGHTLYAND SAID AGAIN I THANK YOU PROCEEDING TO REMARK ON THE RARE BEAUTYOF THE DAY
LYDGATE CERTAIN THAT HIS PATIENT WISHED TO BE ALONE SOON LEFT HIMAND THE BLACK FIGURE WITH HANDS BEHIND AND HEAD BENT FORWARD CONTINUEDTO PACE THE WALK WHERE THE DARK YEWTREES GAVE HIM A MUTE COMPANIONSHIPIN MELANCHOLY AND THE LITTLE SHADOWS OF BIRD OR LEAF THAT FLEETEDACROSS THE ISLES OF SUNLIGHT STOLE ALONG IN SILENCE AS IN THE PRESENCEOF A SORROW
 HERE WAS A MAN WHO NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME FOUND HIMSELFLOOKING INTO THE EYES OF DEATHWHO WAS PASSING THROUGH ONE OF THOSERARE MOMENTS OF EXPERIENCE WHEN WE FEEL THE TRUTH OF A COMMONPLACEWHICH IS AS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE CALL KNOWING IT AS THE VISION OFWATERS UPON THE EARTH IS DIFFERENT FROM THE DELIRIOUS VISION OF THEWATER WHICH CANNOT BE HAD TO COOL THE BURNING TONGUE
 WHEN THECOMMONPLACE WE MUST ALL DIE TRANSFORMS ITSELF SUDDENLY INTO THE ACUTECONSCIOUSNESS I MUST DIEAND SOON THEN DEATH GRAPPLES US AND HISFINGERS ARE CRUEL AFTERWARDS HE MAY COME TO FOLD US IN HIS ARMS ASOUR MOTHER DID AND OUR LAST MOMENT OF DIM EARTHLY DISCERNING MAY BELIKE THE FIRST
 TO MR
 CASAUBON NOW IT WAS AS IF HE SUDDENLY FOUNDHIMSELF ON THE DARK RIVERBRINK AND HEARD THE PLASH OF THE ONCOMINGOAR NOT DISCERNING THE FORMS BUT EXPECTING THE SUMMONS
 IN SUCH ANHOUR THE MIND DOES NOT CHANGE ITS LIFELONG BIAS BUT CARRIES IT ONWARDIN IMAGINATION TO THE OTHER SIDE OF DEATH GAZING BACKWARDPERHAPS WITHTHE DIVINE CALM OF BENEFICENCE PERHAPS WITH THE PETTY ANXIETIES OFSELFASSERTION
 WHAT WAS MR
 CASAUBONS BIAS HIS ACTS WILL GIVE US ACLEW TO
 HE HELD HIMSELF TO BE WITH SOME PRIVATE SCHOLARLYRESERVATIONS A BELIEVING CHRISTIAN AS TO ESTIMATES OF THE PRESENT ANDHOPES OF THE FUTURE
 BUT WHAT WE STRIVE TO GRATIFY THOUGH WE MAY CALLIT A DISTANT HOPE IS AN IMMEDIATE DESIRE THE FUTURE ESTATE FOR WHICHMEN DRUDGE UP CITY ALLEYS EXISTS ALREADY IN THEIR IMAGINATION AND LOVE
AND MR
 CASAUBONS IMMEDIATE DESIRE WAS NOT FOR DIVINE COMMUNION ANDLIGHT DIVESTED OF EARTHLY CONDITIONS HIS PASSIONATE LONGINGS POORMAN CLUNG LOW AND MISTLIKE IN VERY SHADY PLACES
DOROTHEA HAD BEEN AWARE WHEN LYDGATE HAD RIDDEN AWAY AND SHE HADSTEPPED INTO THE GARDEN WITH THE IMPULSE TO GO AT ONCE TO HER HUSBAND
BUT SHE HESITATED FEARING TO OFFEND HIM BY OBTRUDING HERSELF FOR HERARDOR CONTINUALLY REPULSED SERVED WITH HER INTENSE MEMORY TOHEIGHTEN HER DREAD AS THWARTED ENERGY SUBSIDES INTO A SHUDDER AND SHEWANDERED SLOWLY ROUND THE NEARER CLUMPS OF TREES UNTIL SHE SAW HIMADVANCING
 THEN SHE WENT TOWARDS HIM AND MIGHT HAVE REPRESENTED AHEAVENSENT ANGEL COMING WITH A PROMISE THAT THE SHORT HOURS REMAININGSHOULD YET BE FILLED WITH THAT FAITHFUL LOVE WHICH CLINGS THE CLOSER TOA COMPREHENDED GRIEF
 HIS GLANCE IN REPLY TO HERS WAS SO CHILL THAT SHEFELT HER TIMIDITY INCREASED YET SHE TURNED AND PASSED HER HAND THROUGHHIS ARM
MR
 CASAUBON KEPT HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM AND ALLOWED HER PLIANT ARM TOCLING WITH DIFFICULTY AGAINST HIS RIGID ARM
THERE WAS SOMETHING HORRIBLE TO DOROTHEA IN THE SENSATION WHICH THISUNRESPONSIVE HARDNESS INFLICTED ON HER
 THAT IS A STRONG WORD BUT NOTTOO STRONG IT IS IN THESE ACTS CALLED TRIVIALITIES THAT THE SEEDS OFJOY ARE FOREVER WASTED UNTIL MEN AND WOMEN LOOK ROUND WITH HAGGARDFACES AT THE DEVASTATION THEIR OWN WASTE HAS MADE AND SAY THE EARTHBEARS NO HARVEST OF SWEETNESSCALLING THEIR DENIAL KNOWLEDGE
 YOU MAYASK WHY IN THE NAME OF MANLINESS MR
 CASAUBON SHOULD HAVE BEHAVED INTHAT WAY
 CONSIDER THAT HIS WAS A MIND WHICH SHRANK FROM PITY HAVE YOUEVER WATCHED IN SUCH A MIND THE EFFECT OF A SUSPICION THAT WHAT ISPRESSING IT AS A GRIEF MAY BE REALLY A SOURCE OF CONTENTMENT EITHERACTUAL OR FUTURE TO THE BEING WHO ALREADY OFFENDS BY PITYING
 BESIDESHE KNEW LITTLE OF DOROTHEAS SENSATIONS AND HAD NOT REFLECTED THAT ONSUCH AN OCCASION AS THE PRESENT THEY WERE COMPARABLE IN STRENGTH TO HISOWN SENSIBILITIES ABOUT CARPS CRITICISMS
DOROTHEA DID NOT WITHDRAW HER ARM BUT SHE COULD NOT VENTURE TO SPEAK
MR
 CASAUBON DID NOT SAY I WISH TO BE ALONE BUT HE DIRECTED HISSTEPS IN SILENCE TOWARDS THE HOUSE AND AS THEY ENTERED BY THE GLASSDOOR ON THIS EASTERN SIDE DOROTHEA WITHDREW HER ARM AND LINGERED ONTHE MATTING THAT SHE MIGHT LEAVE HER HUSBAND QUITE FREE
 HE ENTEREDTHE LIBRARY AND SHUT HIMSELF IN ALONE WITH HIS SORROW
SHE WENT UP TO HER BOUDOIR
 THE OPEN BOWWINDOW LET IN THE SERENE GLORYOF THE AFTERNOON LYING IN THE AVENUE WHERE THE LIMETREES CAST LONGSHADOWS
 BUT DOROTHEA KNEW NOTHING OF THE SCENE
 SHE THREW HERSELF ON ACHAIR NOT HEEDING THAT SHE WAS IN THE DAZZLING SUNRAYS IF THERE WEREDISCOMFORT IN THAT HOW COULD SHE TELL THAT IT WAS NOT PART OF HERINWARD MISERY
SHE WAS IN THE REACTION OF A REBELLIOUS ANGER STRONGER THAN ANY SHE HADFELT SINCE HER MARRIAGE
 INSTEAD OF TEARS THERE CAME WORDSWHAT HAVE I DONEWHAT AM ITHAT HE SHOULD TREAT ME SO
 HE NEVER KNOWSWHAT IS IN MY MINDHE NEVER CARES
 WHAT IS THE USE OF ANYTHING I DO
 HEWISHES HE HAD NEVER MARRIED ME
SHE BEGAN TO HEAR HERSELF AND WAS CHECKED INTO STILLNESS
 LIKE ONE WHOHAS LOST HIS WAY AND IS WEARY SHE SAT AND SAW AS IN ONE GLANCE ALL THEPATHS OF HER YOUNG HOPE WHICH SHE SHOULD NEVER FIND AGAIN
 AND JUST ASCLEARLY IN THE MISERABLE LIGHT SHE SAW HER OWN AND HER HUSBANDSSOLITUDEHOW THEY WALKED APART SO THAT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO SURVEY HIM
IF HE HAD DRAWN HER TOWARDS HIM SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE SURVEYEDHIMNEVER HAVE SAID IS HE WORTH LIVING FOR
 BUT WOULD HAVE FELT HIMSIMPLY A PART OF HER OWN LIFE
 NOW SHE SAID BITTERLY IT IS HIS FAULTNOT MINE
 IN THE JAR OF HER WHOLE BEING PITY WAS OVERTHROWN
 WAS ITHER FAULT THAT SHE HAD BELIEVED IN HIMHAD BELIEVED IN HISWORTHINESS
AND WHAT EXACTLY WAS HE
 SHE WAS ABLE ENOUGH TO ESTIMATEHIMSHE WHO WAITED ON HIS GLANCES WITH TREMBLING AND SHUT HER BESTSOUL IN PRISON PAYING IT ONLY HIDDEN VISITS THAT SHE MIGHT BE PETTYENOUGH TO PLEASE HIM
 IN SUCH A CRISIS AS THIS SOME WOMEN BEGIN TOHATE
THE SUN WAS LOW WHEN DOROTHEA WAS THINKING THAT SHE WOULD NOT GO DOWNAGAIN BUT WOULD SEND A MESSAGE TO HER HUSBAND SAYING THAT SHE WAS NOTWELL AND PREFERRED REMAINING UPSTAIRS
 SHE HAD NEVER DELIBERATELYALLOWED HER RESENTMENT TO GOVERN HER IN THIS WAY BEFORE BUT SHEBELIEVED NOW THAT SHE COULD NOT SEE HIM AGAIN WITHOUT TELLING HIM THETRUTH ABOUT HER FEELING AND SHE MUST WAIT TILL SHE COULD DO IT WITHOUTINTERRUPTION
 HE MIGHT WONDER AND BE HURT AT HER MESSAGE
 IT WAS GOODTHAT HE SHOULD WONDER AND BE HURT
 HER ANGER SAID AS ANGER IS APT TOSAY THAT GOD WAS WITH HERTHAT ALL HEAVEN THOUGH IT WERE CROWDED WITHSPIRITS WATCHING THEM MUST BE ON HER SIDE
 SHE HAD DETERMINED TO RINGHER BELL WHEN THERE CAME A RAP AT THE DOOR
MR
 CASAUBON HAD SENT TO SAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE HIS DINNER IN THELIBRARY
 HE WISHED TO BE QUITE ALONE THIS EVENING BEING MUCH OCCUPIED
I SHALL NOT DINE THEN TANTRIPP
OH MADAM LET ME BRING YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING
NO I AM NOT WELL
 GET EVERYTHING READY IN MY DRESSING ROOM BUT PRAYDO NOT DISTURB ME AGAIN
DOROTHEA SAT ALMOST MOTIONLESS IN HER MEDITATIVE STRUGGLE WHILE THEEVENING SLOWLY DEEPENED INTO NIGHT
 BUT THE STRUGGLE CHANGEDCONTINUALLY AS THAT OF A MAN WHO BEGINS WITH A MOVEMENT TOWARDSSTRIKING AND ENDS WITH CONQUERING HIS DESIRE TO STRIKE
 THE ENERGY THATWOULD ANIMATE A CRIME IS NOT MORE THAN IS WANTED TO INSPIRE A RESOLVEDSUBMISSION WHEN THE NOBLE HABIT OF THE SOUL REASSERTS ITSELF
 THATTHOUGHT WITH WHICH DOROTHEA HAD GONE OUT TO MEET HER HUSBANDHERCONVICTION THAT HE HAD BEEN ASKING ABOUT THE POSSIBLE ARREST OF ALL HISWORK AND THAT THE ANSWER MUST HAVE WRUNG HIS HEART COULD NOT BE LONGWITHOUT RISING BESIDE THE IMAGE OF HIM LIKE A SHADOWY MONITOR LOOKINGAT HER ANGER WITH SAD REMONSTRANCE
 IT COST HER A LITANY OF PICTUREDSORROWS AND OF SILENT CRIES THAT SHE MIGHT BE THE MERCY FOR THOSESORROWSBUT THE RESOLVED SUBMISSION DID COME AND WHEN THE HOUSE WASSTILL AND SHE KNEW THAT IT WAS NEAR THE TIME WHEN MR
 CASAUBONHABITUALLY WENT TO REST SHE OPENED HER DOOR GENTLY AND STOOD OUTSIDEIN THE DARKNESS WAITING FOR HIS COMING UPSTAIRS WITH A LIGHT IN HISHAND
 IF HE DID NOT COME SOON SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD GO DOWN ANDEVEN RISK INCURRING ANOTHER PANG
 SHE WOULD NEVER AGAIN EXPECT ANYTHINGELSE
 BUT SHE DID HEAR THE LIBRARY DOOR OPEN AND SLOWLY THE LIGHTADVANCED UP THE STAIRCASE WITHOUT NOISE FROM THE FOOTSTEPS ON THECARPET
 WHEN HER HUSBAND STOOD OPPOSITE TO HER SHE SAW THAT HIS FACEWAS MORE HAGGARD
 HE STARTED SLIGHTLY ON SEEING HER AND SHE LOOKED UPAT HIM BESEECHINGLY WITHOUT SPEAKING
DOROTHEA
 HE SAID WITH A GENTLE SURPRISE IN HIS TONE
 WERE YOUWAITING FOR ME
YES I DID NOT LIKE TO DISTURB YOU
COME MY DEAR COME
 YOU ARE YOUNG AND NEED NOT TO EXTEND YOUR LIFEBY WATCHING
WHEN THE KIND QUIET MELANCHOLY OF THAT SPEECH FELL ON DOROTHEAS EARSSHE FELT SOMETHING LIKE THE THANKFULNESS THAT MIGHT WELL UP IN US IF WEHAD NARROWLY ESCAPED HURTING A LAMED CREATURE
 SHE PUT HER HAND INTOHER HUSBANDS AND THEY WENT ALONG THE BROAD CORRIDOR TOGETHER

CHAPTER XLIII
THIS FIGURE HATH HIGH PRICE T WAS WROUGHT WITH LOVEAGES AGO IN FINEST IVORYNOUGHT MODISH IN IT PURE AND NOBLE LINESOF GENEROUS WOMANHOOD THAT FITS ALL TIMETHAT TOO IS COSTLY WARE MAJOLICAOF DEFT DESIGN TO PLEASE A LORDLY EYETHE SMILE YOU SEE IS PERFECTWONDERFULAS MERE FAIENCE
 A TABLE ORNAMENTTO SUIT THE RICHEST MOUNTING
DOROTHEA SELDOM LEFT HOME WITHOUT HER HUSBAND BUT SHE DID OCCASIONALLYDRIVE INTO MIDDLEMARCH ALONE ON LITTLE ERRANDS OF SHOPPING OR CHARITYSUCH AS OCCUR TO EVERY LADY OF ANY WEALTH WHEN SHE LIVES WITHIN THREEMILES OF A TOWN
 TWO DAYS AFTER THAT SCENE IN THE YEWTREE WALK SHEDETERMINED TO USE SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY IN ORDER IF POSSIBLE TO SEELYDGATE AND LEARN FROM HIM WHETHER HER HUSBAND HAD REALLY FELT ANYDEPRESSING CHANGE OF SYMPTOMS WHICH HE WAS CONCEALING FROM HER ANDWHETHER HE HAD INSISTED ON KNOWING THE UTMOST ABOUT HIMSELF
 SHE FELTALMOST GUILTY IN ASKING FOR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HIM FROM ANOTHER BUT THEDREAD OF BEING WITHOUT ITTHE DREAD OF THAT IGNORANCE WHICH WOULD MAKEHER UNJUST OR HARDOVERCAME EVERY SCRUPLE
 THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOMECRISIS IN HER HUSBANDS MIND SHE WAS CERTAIN HE HAD THE VERY NEXT DAYBEGUN A NEW METHOD OF ARRANGING HIS NOTES AND HAD ASSOCIATED HER QUITENEWLY IN CARRYING OUT HIS PLAN
 POOR DOROTHEA NEEDED TO LAY UP STORESOF PATIENCE
IT WAS ABOUT FOUR OCLOCK WHEN SHE DROVE TO LYDGATES HOUSE IN LOWICKGATE WISHING IN HER IMMEDIATE DOUBT OF FINDING HIM AT HOME THAT SHEHAD WRITTEN BEFOREHAND
 AND HE WAS NOT AT HOME
IS MRS
 LYDGATE AT HOME
 SAID DOROTHEA WHO HAD NEVER THAT SHE KNEWOF SEEN ROSAMOND BUT NOW REMEMBERED THE FACT OF THE MARRIAGE
 YESMRS
 LYDGATE WAS AT HOME
I WILL GO IN AND SPEAK TO HER IF SHE WILL ALLOW ME
 WILL YOU ASK HERIF SHE CAN SEE MESEE MRS
 CASAUBON FOR A FEW MINUTES
WHEN THE SERVANT HAD GONE TO DELIVER THAT MESSAGE DOROTHEA COULD HEARSOUNDS OF MUSIC THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOWA FEW NOTES FROM A MANS VOICEAND THEN A PIANO BURSTING INTO ROULADES
 BUT THE ROULADES BROKE OFFSUDDENLY AND THEN THE SERVANT CAME BACK SAYING THAT MRS
 LYDGATE WOULDBE HAPPY TO SEE MRS
 CASAUBON
WHEN THE DRAWINGROOM DOOR OPENED AND DOROTHEA ENTERED THERE WAS ASORT OF CONTRAST NOT INFREQUENT IN COUNTRY LIFE WHEN THE HABITS OF THEDIFFERENT RANKS WERE LESS BLENT THAN NOW
 LET THOSE WHO KNOW TELL USEXACTLY WHAT STUFF IT WAS THAT DOROTHEA WORE IN THOSE DAYS OF MILDAUTUMNTHAT THIN WHITE WOOLLEN STUFF SOFT TO THE TOUCH AND SOFT TO THEEYE
 IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN LATELY WASHED AND TO SMELL OF THESWEET HEDGESWAS ALWAYS IN THE SHAPE OF A PELISSE WITH SLEEVES HANGINGALL OUT OF THE FASHION
 YET IF SHE HAD ENTERED BEFORE A STILL AUDIENCEAS IMOGENE OR CATOS DAUGHTER THE DRESS MIGHT HAVE SEEMED RIGHTENOUGH THE GRACE AND DIGNITY WERE IN HER LIMBS AND NECK AND ABOUT HERSIMPLY PARTED HAIR AND CANDID EYES THE LARGE ROUND POKE WHICH WAS THENIN THE FATE OF WOMEN SEEMED NO MORE ODD AS A HEADDRESS THAN THE GOLDTRENCHER WE CALL A HALO
 BY THE PRESENT AUDIENCE OF TWO PERSONS NODRAMATIC HEROINE COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED WITH MORE INTEREST THAN MRS
CASAUBON
 TO ROSAMOND SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE COUNTY DIVINITIES NOT MIXINGWITH MIDDLEMARCH MORTALITY WHOSE SLIGHTEST MARKS OF MANNER ORAPPEARANCE WERE WORTHY OF HER STUDY MOREOVER ROSAMOND WAS NOT WITHOUTSATISFACTION THAT MRS
 CASAUBON SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF STUDYINGHER
 WHAT IS THE USE OF BEING EXQUISITE IF YOU ARE NOT SEEN BY THEBEST JUDGES
 AND SINCE ROSAMOND HAD RECEIVED THE HIGHEST COMPLIMENTS ATSIR GODWIN LYDGATES SHE FELT QUITE CONFIDENT OF THE IMPRESSION SHEMUST MAKE ON PEOPLE OF GOOD BIRTH
 DOROTHEA PUT OUT HER HAND WITH HERUSUAL SIMPLE KINDNESS AND LOOKED ADMIRINGLY AT LYDGATES LOVELYBRIDEAWARE THAT THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN STANDING AT A DISTANCE BUTSEEING HIM MERELY AS A COATED FIGURE AT A WIDE ANGLE
 THE GENTLEMAN WASTOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH THE PRESENCE OF THE ONE WOMAN TO REFLECT ON THECONTRAST BETWEEN THE TWOA CONTRAST THAT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEENSTRIKING TO A CALM OBSERVER
 THEY WERE BOTH TALL AND THEIR EYES WEREON A LEVEL BUT IMAGINE ROSAMONDS INFANTINE BLONDNESS AND WONDROUSCROWN OF HAIRPLAITS WITH HER PALEBLUE DRESS OF A FIT AND FASHION SOPERFECT THAT NO DRESSMAKER COULD LOOK AT IT WITHOUT EMOTION A LARGEEMBROIDERED COLLAR WHICH IT WAS TO BE HOPED ALL BEHOLDERS WOULD KNOWTHE PRICE OF HER SMALL HANDS DULY SET OFF WITH RINGS AND THATCONTROLLED SELFCONSCIOUSNESS OF MANNER WHICH IS THE EXPENSIVESUBSTITUTE FOR SIMPLICITY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO INTERRUPT YOU SAID DOROTHEAIMMEDIATELY
 I AM ANXIOUS TO SEE MR
 LYDGATE IF POSSIBLE BEFORE I GOHOME AND I HOPED THAT YOU MIGHT POSSIBLY TELL ME WHERE I COULD FINDHIM OR EVEN ALLOW ME TO WAIT FOR HIM IF YOU EXPECT HIM SOON
HE IS AT THE NEW HOSPITAL SAID ROSAMOND I AM NOT SURE HOW SOON HEWILL COME HOME
 BUT I CAN SEND FOR HIM
WILL YOU LET ME GO AND FETCH HIM
 SAID WILL LADISLAW COMING FORWARD
HE HAD ALREADY TAKEN UP HIS HAT BEFORE DOROTHEA ENTERED
 SHE COLOREDWITH SURPRISE BUT PUT OUT HER HAND WITH A SMILE OF UNMISTAKABLEPLEASURE SAYINGI DID NOT KNOW IT WAS YOU I HAD NO THOUGHT OF SEEING YOU HERE
MAY I GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND TELL MR
 LYDGATE THAT YOU WISH TO SEEHIM
 SAID WILL
IT WOULD BE QUICKER TO SEND THE CARRIAGE FOR HIM SAID DOROTHEA IFYOU WILL BE KIND ENOUGH TO GIVE THE MESSAGE TO THE COACHMAN
WILL WAS MOVING TO THE DOOR WHEN DOROTHEA WHOSE MIND HAD FLASHED IN ANINSTANT OVER MANY CONNECTED MEMORIES TURNED QUICKLY AND SAID I WILLGO MYSELF THANK YOU
 I WISH TO LOSE NO TIME BEFORE GETTING HOME AGAIN
I WILL DRIVE TO THE HOSPITAL AND SEE MR
 LYDGATE THERE
 PRAY EXCUSE MEMRS
 LYDGATE
 I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
HER MIND WAS EVIDENTLY ARRESTED BY SOME SUDDEN THOUGHT AND SHE LEFTTHE ROOM HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT WAS IMMEDIATELY AROUND HERHARDLYCONSCIOUS THAT WILL OPENED THE DOOR FOR HER AND OFFERED HER HIS ARM TOLEAD HER TO THE CARRIAGE
 SHE TOOK THE ARM BUT SAID NOTHING
 WILL WASFEELING RATHER VEXED AND MISERABLE AND FOUND NOTHING TO SAY ON HISSIDE
 HE HANDED HER INTO THE CARRIAGE IN SILENCE THEY SAID GOODBYAND DOROTHEA DROVE AWAY
IN THE FIVE MINUTES DRIVE TO THE HOSPITAL SHE HAD TIME FOR SOMEREFLECTIONS THAT WERE QUITE NEW TO HER
 HER DECISION TO GO AND HERPREOCCUPATION IN LEAVING THE ROOM HAD COME FROM THE SUDDEN SENSE THATTHERE WOULD BE A SORT OF DECEPTION IN HER VOLUNTARILY ALLOWING ANYFURTHER INTERCOURSE BETWEEN HERSELF AND WILL WHICH SHE WAS UNABLE TOMENTION TO HER HUSBAND AND ALREADY HER ERRAND IN SEEKING LYDGATE WAS AMATTER OF CONCEALMENT
 THAT WAS ALL THAT HAD BEEN EXPLICITLY IN HERMIND BUT SHE HAD BEEN URGED ALSO BY A VAGUE DISCOMFORT
 NOW THAT SHEWAS ALONE IN HER DRIVE SHE HEARD THE NOTES OF THE MANS VOICE AND THEACCOMPANYING PIANO WHICH SHE HAD NOT NOTED MUCH AT THE TIME RETURNINGON HER INWARD SENSE AND SHE FOUND HERSELF THINKING WITH SOME WONDERTHAT WILL LADISLAW WAS PASSING HIS TIME WITH MRS
 LYDGATE IN HERHUSBANDS ABSENCE
 AND THEN SHE COULD NOT HELP REMEMBERING THAT HE HADPASSED SOME TIME WITH HER UNDER LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES SO WHY SHOULD THEREBE ANY UNFITNESS IN THE FACT
 BUT WILL WAS MR
 CASAUBONS RELATIVE ANDONE TOWARDS WHOM SHE WAS BOUND TO SHOW KINDNESS
 STILL THERE HAD BEENSIGNS WHICH PERHAPS SHE OUGHT TO HAVE UNDERSTOOD AS IMPLYING THAT MR
CASAUBON DID NOT LIKE HIS COUSINS VISITS DURING HIS OWN ABSENCE
PERHAPS I HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN IN MANY THINGS SAID POOR DOROTHEA TOHERSELF WHILE THE TEARS CAME ROLLING AND SHE HAD TO DRY THEM QUICKLY
SHE FELT CONFUSEDLY UNHAPPY AND THE IMAGE OF WILL WHICH HAD BEEN SOCLEAR TO HER BEFORE WAS MYSTERIOUSLY SPOILED
 BUT THE CARRIAGE STOPPEDAT THE GATE OF THE HOSPITAL
 SHE WAS SOON WALKING ROUND THE GRASS PLOTSWITH LYDGATE AND HER FEELINGS RECOVERED THE STRONG BENT WHICH HAD MADEHER SEEK FOR THIS INTERVIEW
WILL LADISLAW MEANWHILE WAS MORTIFIED AND KNEW THE REASON OF ITCLEARLY ENOUGH
 HIS CHANCES OF MEETING DOROTHEA WERE RARE AND HERE FORTHE FIRST TIME THERE HAD COME A CHANCE WHICH HAD SET HIM AT ADISADVANTAGE
 IT WAS NOT ONLY AS IT HAD BEEN HITHERTO THAT SHE WASNOT SUPREMELY OCCUPIED WITH HIM BUT THAT SHE HAD SEEN HIM UNDERCIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH HE MIGHT APPEAR NOT TO BE SUPREMELY OCCUPIEDWITH HER
 HE FELT THRUST TO A NEW DISTANCE FROM HER AMONGST THECIRCLES OF MIDDLEMARCHERS WHO MADE NO PART OF HER LIFE
 BUT THAT WASNOT HIS FAULT OF COURSE SINCE HE HAD TAKEN HIS LODGINGS IN THE TOWNHE HAD BEEN MAKING AS MANY ACQUAINTANCES AS HE COULD HIS POSITIONREQUIRING THAT HE SHOULD KNOW EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING
 LYDGATE WASREALLY BETTER WORTH KNOWING THAN ANY ONE ELSE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ANDHE HAPPENED TO HAVE A WIFE WHO WAS MUSICAL AND ALTOGETHER WORTH CALLINGUPON
 HERE WAS THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE SITUATION IN WHICH DIANA HADDESCENDED TOO UNEXPECTEDLY ON HER WORSHIPPER
 IT WAS MORTIFYING
 WILLWAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AT MIDDLEMARCH BUT FORDOROTHEA AND YET HIS POSITION THERE WAS THREATENING TO DIVIDE HIM FROMHER WITH THOSE BARRIERS OF HABITUAL SENTIMENT WHICH ARE MORE FATAL TOTHE PERSISTENCE OF MUTUAL INTEREST THAN ALL THE DISTANCE BETWEEN ROMEAND BRITAIN
 PREJUDICES ABOUT RANK AND STATUS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO DEFYIN THE FORM OF A TYRANNICAL LETTER FROM MR
 CASAUBON BUT PREJUDICESLIKE ODOROUS BODIES HAVE A DOUBLE EXISTENCE BOTH SOLID ANDSUBTLESOLID AS THE PYRAMIDS SUBTLE AS THE TWENTIETH ECHO OF AN ECHOOR AS THE MEMORY OF HYACINTHS WHICH ONCE SCENTED THE DARKNESS
 AND WILLWAS OF A TEMPERAMENT TO FEEL KEENLY THE PRESENCE OF SUBTLETIES A MANOF CLUMSIER PERCEPTIONS WOULD NOT HAVE FELT AS HE DID THAT FOR THEFIRST TIME SOME SENSE OF UNFITNESS IN PERFECT FREEDOM WITH HIM HADSPRUNG UP IN DOROTHEAS MIND AND THAT THEIR SILENCE AS HE CONDUCTEDHER TO THE CARRIAGE HAD HAD A CHILL IN IT
 PERHAPS CASAUBON IN HISHATRED AND JEALOUSY HAD BEEN INSISTING TO DOROTHEA THAT WILL HAD SLIDBELOW HER SOCIALLY
 CONFOUND CASAUBON
WILL REENTERED THE DRAWINGROOM TOOK UP HIS HAT AND LOOKINGIRRITATED AS HE ADVANCED TOWARDS MRS
 LYDGATE WHO HAD SEATED HERSELFAT HER WORKTABLE SAIDIT IS ALWAYS FATAL TO HAVE MUSIC OR POETRY INTERRUPTED
 MAY I COMEANOTHER DAY AND JUST FINISH ABOUT THE RENDERING OF LUNGI DAL CAROBENE
I SHALL BE HAPPY TO BE TAUGHT SAID ROSAMOND
 BUT I AM SURE YOUADMIT THAT THE INTERRUPTION WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL ONE
 I QUITE ENVY YOURACQUAINTANCE WITH MRS
 CASAUBON
 IS SHE VERY CLEVER
 SHE LOOKS AS IFSHE WERE
REALLY I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT SAID WILL SULKILY
THAT IS JUST THE ANSWER TERTIUS GAVE ME WHEN I FIRST ASKED HIM IF SHEWERE HANDSOME
 WHAT IS IT THAT YOU GENTLEMEN ARE THINKING OF WHEN YOUARE WITH MRS
 CASAUBON
HERSELF SAID WILL NOT INDISPOSED TO PROVOKE THE CHARMING MRS
LYDGATE
 WHEN ONE SEES A PERFECT WOMAN ONE NEVER THINKS OF HERATTRIBUTESONE IS CONSCIOUS OF HER PRESENCE
I SHALL BE JEALOUS WHEN TERTIUS GOES TO LOWICK SAID ROSAMONDDIMPLING AND SPEAKING WITH AERY LIGHTNESS
 HE WILL COME BACK ANDTHINK NOTHING OF ME
THAT DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN THE EFFECT ON LYDGATE HITHERTO
 MRS
CASAUBON IS TOO UNLIKE OTHER WOMEN FOR THEM TO BE COMPARED WITH HER
YOU ARE A DEVOUT WORSHIPPER I PERCEIVE
 YOU OFTEN SEE HER ISUPPOSE
NO SAID WILL ALMOST PETTISHLY
 WORSHIP IS USUALLY A MATTER OFTHEORY RATHER THAN OF PRACTICE
 BUT I AM PRACTISING IT TO EXCESS JUSTAT THIS MOMENTI MUST REALLY TEAR MYSELF AWAY
PRAY COME AGAIN SOME EVENING MR
 LYDGATE WILL LIKE TO HEAR THE MUSICAND I CANNOT ENJOY IT SO WELL WITHOUT HIM
WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS AT HOME AGAIN ROSAMOND SAID STANDING IN FRONT OFHIM AND HOLDING HIS COATCOLLAR WITH BOTH HER HANDS MR
 LADISLAW WASHERE SINGING WITH ME WHEN MRS
 CASAUBON CAME IN
 HE SEEMED VEXED
 DOYOU THINK HE DISLIKED HER SEEING HIM AT OUR HOUSE
 SURELY YOUR POSITIONIS MORE THAN EQUAL TO HISWHATEVER MAY BE HIS RELATION TO THECASAUBONS
NO NO IT MUST BE SOMETHING ELSE IF HE WERE REALLY VEXED
 LADISLAW ISA SORT OF GYPSY HE THINKS NOTHING OF LEATHER AND PRUNELLA
MUSIC APART HE IS NOT ALWAYS VERY AGREEABLE
 DO YOU LIKE HIM
YES I THINK HE IS A GOOD FELLOW RATHER MISCELLANEOUS ANDBRICABRAC BUT LIKABLE
DO YOU KNOW I THINK HE ADORES MRS
 CASAUBON
POOR DEVIL
 SAID LYDGATE SMILING AND PINCHING HIS WIFES EARS
ROSAMOND FELT HERSELF BEGINNING TO KNOW A GREAT DEAL OF THE WORLDESPECIALLY IN DISCOVERING WHAT WHEN SHE WAS IN HER UNMARRIED GIRLHOODHAD BEEN INCONCEIVABLE TO HER EXCEPT AS A DIM TRAGEDY IN BYGONECOSTUMESTHAT WOMEN EVEN AFTER MARRIAGE MIGHT MAKE CONQUESTS ANDENSLAVE MEN
 AT THAT TIME YOUNG LADIES IN THE COUNTRY EVEN WHENEDUCATED AT MRS
 LEMONS READ LITTLE FRENCH LITERATURE LATER THANRACINE AND PUBLIC PRINTS HAD NOT CAST THEIR PRESENT MAGNIFICENTILLUMINATION OVER THE SCANDALS OF LIFE
 STILL VANITY WITH A WOMANSWHOLE MIND AND DAY TO WORK IN CAN CONSTRUCT ABUNDANTLY ON SLIGHTHINTS ESPECIALLY ON SUCH A HINT AS THE POSSIBILITY OF INDEFINITECONQUESTS
 HOW DELIGHTFUL TO MAKE CAPTIVES FROM THE THRONE OF MARRIAGEWITH A HUSBAND AS CROWNPRINCE BY YOUR SIDEHIMSELF IN FACT ASUBJECTWHILE THE CAPTIVES LOOK UP FOREVER HOPELESS LOSING THEIR RESTPROBABLY AND IF THEIR APPETITE TOO SO MUCH THE BETTER
 BUT ROSAMONDSROMANCE TURNED AT PRESENT CHIEFLY ON HER CROWNPRINCE AND IT WASENOUGH TO ENJOY HIS ASSURED SUBJECTION
 WHEN HE SAID POOR DEVIL
 SHEASKED WITH PLAYFUL CURIOSITYWHY SO
WHY WHAT CAN A MAN DO WHEN HE TAKES TO ADORING ONE OF YOU MERMAIDS
HE ONLY NEGLECTS HIS WORK AND RUNS UP BILLS
I AM SURE YOU DO NOT NEGLECT YOUR WORK
 YOU ARE ALWAYS AT THEHOSPITAL OR SEEING POOR PATIENTS OR THINKING ABOUT SOME DOCTORSQUARREL AND THEN AT HOME YOU ALWAYS WANT TO PORE OVER YOUR MICROSCOPEAND PHIALS
 CONFESS YOU LIKE THOSE THINGS BETTER THAN ME
HAVENT YOU AMBITION ENOUGH TO WISH THAT YOUR HUSBAND SHOULD BESOMETHING BETTER THAN A MIDDLEMARCH DOCTOR
 SAID LYDGATE LETTING HISHANDS FALL ON TO HIS WIFES SHOULDERS AND LOOKING AT HER WITHAFFECTIONATE GRAVITY
 I SHALL MAKE YOU LEARN MY FAVORITE BIT FROM ANOLD POETWHY SHOULD OUR PRIDE MAKE SUCH A STIR TO BEAND BE FORGOT
 WHAT GOOD IS LIKE TO THISTO DO WORTHY THE WRITING AND TO WRITEWORTHY THE READING AND THE WORLDS DELIGHT
WHAT I WANT ROSY IS TO DO WORTHY THE WRITINGAND TO WRITE OUT MYSELFWHAT I HAVE DONE
 A MAN MUST WORK TO DO THAT MY PET
OF COURSE I WISH YOU TO MAKE DISCOVERIES NO ONE COULD MORE WISH YOUTO ATTAIN A HIGH POSITION IN SOME BETTER PLACE THAN MIDDLEMARCH
 YOUCANNOT SAY THAT I HAVE EVER TRIED TO HINDER YOU FROM WORKING
 BUT WECANNOT LIVE LIKE HERMITS
 YOU ARE NOT DISCONTENTED WITH ME TERTIUS
NO DEAR NO
 I AM TOO ENTIRELY CONTENTED
BUT WHAT DID MRS
 CASAUBON WANT TO SAY TO YOU
MERELY TO ASK ABOUT HER HUSBANDS HEALTH
 BUT I THINK SHE IS GOING TOBE SPLENDID TO OUR NEW HOSPITAL I THINK SHE WILL GIVE US TWO HUNDREDAYEAR
CHAPTER XLIV
I WOULD NOT CREEP ALONG THE COAST BUT STEEROUT IN MIDSEA BY GUIDANCE OF THE STARS
WHEN DOROTHEA WALKING ROUND THE LAURELPLANTED PLOTS OF THE NEWHOSPITAL WITH LYDGATE HAD LEARNED FROM HIM THAT THERE WERE NO SIGNS OFCHANGE IN MR
 CASAUBONS BODILY CONDITION BEYOND THE MENTAL SIGN OFANXIETY TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS ILLNESS SHE WAS SILENT FOR A FEWMOMENTS WONDERING WHETHER SHE HAD SAID OR DONE ANYTHING TO ROUSE THISNEW ANXIETY
 LYDGATE NOT WILLING TO LET SLIP AN OPPORTUNITY OFFURTHERING A FAVORITE PURPOSE VENTURED TO SAYI DONT KNOW WHETHER YOUR OR MR
 CASAUBONS ATTENTION HAS BEEN DRAWNTO THE NEEDS OF OUR NEW HOSPITAL
 CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE MADE IT SEEMRATHER EGOTISTIC IN ME TO URGE THE SUBJECT BUT THAT IS NOT MY FAULTIT IS BECAUSE THERE IS A FIGHT BEING MADE AGAINST IT BY THE OTHERMEDICAL MEN
 I THINK YOU ARE GENERALLY INTERESTED IN SUCH THINGS FOR IREMEMBER THAT WHEN I FIRST HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU AT TIPTONGRANGE BEFORE YOUR MARRIAGE YOU WERE ASKING ME SOME QUESTIONS ABOUTTHE WAY IN WHICH THE HEALTH OF THE POOR WAS AFFECTED BY THEIR MISERABLEHOUSING
YES INDEED SAID DOROTHEA BRIGHTENING
 I SHALL BE QUITE GRATEFULTO YOU IF YOU WILL TELL ME HOW I CAN HELP TO MAKE THINGS A LITTLEBETTER
 EVERYTHING OF THAT SORT HAS SLIPPED AWAY FROM ME SINCE I HAVEBEEN MARRIED
 I MEAN SHE SAID AFTER A MOMENTS HESITATION THAT THEPEOPLE IN OUR VILLAGE ARE TOLERABLY COMFORTABLE AND MY MIND HAS BEENTOO MUCH TAKEN UP FOR ME TO INQUIRE FURTHER
 BUT HEREIN SUCH A PLACEAS MIDDLEMARCHTHERE MUST BE A GREAT DEAL TO BE DONE
THERE IS EVERYTHING TO BE DONE SAID LYDGATE WITH ABRUPT ENERGY
AND THIS HOSPITAL IS A CAPITAL PIECE OF WORK DUE ENTIRELY TO MR
BULSTRODES EXERTIONS AND IN A GREAT DEGREE TO HIS MONEY
 BUT ONE MANCANT DO EVERYTHING IN A SCHEME OF THIS SORT
 OF COURSE HE LOOKEDFORWARD TO HELP
 AND NOW THERES A MEAN PETTY FEUD SET UP AGAINST THETHING IN THE TOWN BY CERTAIN PERSONS WHO WANT TO MAKE IT A FAILURE
WHAT CAN BE THEIR REASONS
 SAID DOROTHEA WITH NAIVE SURPRISE
CHIEFLY MR
 BULSTRODES UNPOPULARITY TO BEGIN WITH
 HALF THE TOWNWOULD ALMOST TAKE TROUBLE FOR THE SAKE OF THWARTING HIM
 IN THIS STUPIDWORLD MOST PEOPLE NEVER CONSIDER THAT A THING IS GOOD TO BE DONE UNLESSIT IS DONE BY THEIR OWN SET
 I HAD NO CONNECTION WITH BULSTRODE BEFOREI CAME HERE
 I LOOK AT HIM QUITE IMPARTIALLY AND I SEE THAT HE HASSOME NOTIONSTHAT HE HAS SET THINGS ON FOOTWHICH I CAN TURN TO GOODPUBLIC PURPOSE
 IF A FAIR NUMBER OF THE BETTER EDUCATED MEN WENT TOWORK WITH THE BELIEF THAT THEIR OBSERVATIONS MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THEREFORM OF MEDICAL DOCTRINE AND PRACTICE WE SHOULD SOON SEE A CHANGEFOR THE BETTER
 THATS MY POINT OF VIEW
 I HOLD THAT BY REFUSING TOWORK WITH MR
 BULSTRODE I SHOULD BE TURNING MY BACK ON AN OPPORTUNITYOF MAKING MY PROFESSION MORE GENERALLY SERVICEABLE
I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU SAID DOROTHEA AT ONCE FASCINATED BY THESITUATION SKETCHED IN LYDGATES WORDS
 BUT WHAT IS THERE AGAINST MR
BULSTRODE
 I KNOW THAT MY UNCLE IS FRIENDLY WITH HIM
PEOPLE DONT LIKE HIS RELIGIOUS TONE SAID LYDGATE BREAKING OFFTHERE
THAT IS ALL THE STRONGER REASON FOR DESPISING SUCH AN OPPOSITIONSAID DOROTHEA LOOKING AT THE AFFAIRS OF MIDDLEMARCH BY THE LIGHT OFTHE GREAT PERSECUTIONS
TO PUT THE MATTER QUITE FAIRLY THEY HAVE OTHER OBJECTIONS TO HIMHEIS MASTERFUL AND RATHER UNSOCIABLE AND HE IS CONCERNED WITH TRADEWHICH HAS COMPLAINTS OF ITS OWN THAT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT
 BUT WHAT HASTHAT TO DO WITH THE QUESTION WHETHER IT WOULD NOT BE A FINE THING TOESTABLISH HERE A MORE VALUABLE HOSPITAL THAN ANY THEY HAVE IN THECOUNTY
 THE IMMEDIATE MOTIVE TO THE OPPOSITION HOWEVER IS THE FACTTHAT BULSTRODE HAS PUT THE MEDICAL DIRECTION INTO MY HANDS
 OF COURSE IAM GLAD OF THAT
 IT GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SOME GOODWORKAND I AM AWARE THAT I HAVE TO JUSTIFY HIS CHOICE OF ME
 BUT THECONSEQUENCE IS THAT THE WHOLE PROFESSION IN MIDDLEMARCH HAVE SETTHEMSELVES TOOTH AND NAIL AGAINST THE HOSPITAL AND NOT ONLY REFUSE TOCOOPERATE THEMSELVES BUT TRY TO BLACKEN THE WHOLE AFFAIR AND HINDERSUBSCRIPTIONS
HOW VERY PETTY
 EXCLAIMED DOROTHEA INDIGNANTLY
I SUPPOSE ONE MUST EXPECT TO FIGHT ONES WAY THERE IS HARDLY ANYTHINGTO BE DONE WITHOUT IT
 AND THE IGNORANCE OF PEOPLE ABOUT HERE ISSTUPENDOUS
 I DONT LAY CLAIM TO ANYTHING ELSE THAN HAVING USED SOMEOPPORTUNITIES WHICH HAVE NOT COME WITHIN EVERYBODYS REACH BUT THEREIS NO STIFLING THE OFFENCE OF BEING YOUNG AND A NEWCOMER ANDHAPPENING TO KNOW SOMETHING MORE THAN THE OLD INHABITANTS
 STILL IF IBELIEVE THAT I CAN SET GOING A BETTER METHOD OF TREATMENTIF I BELIEVETHAT I CAN PURSUE CERTAIN OBSERVATIONS AND INQUIRIES WHICH MAY BE ALASTING BENEFIT TO MEDICAL PRACTICE I SHOULD BE A BASE TRUCKLER IF IALLOWED ANY CONSIDERATION OF PERSONAL COMFORT TO HINDER ME
 AND THECOURSE IS ALL THE CLEARER FROM THERE BEING NO SALARY IN QUESTION TO PUTMY PERSISTENCE IN AN EQUIVOCAL LIGHT
I AM GLAD YOU HAVE TOLD ME THIS MR
 LYDGATE SAID DOROTHEACORDIALLY
 I FEEL SURE I CAN HELP A LITTLE
 I HAVE SOME MONEY ANDDONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ITTHAT IS OFTEN AN UNCOMFORTABLE THOUGHT TOME
 I AM SURE I CAN SPARE TWO HUNDRED AYEAR FOR A GRAND PURPOSE LIKETHIS
 HOW HAPPY YOU MUST BE TO KNOW THINGS THAT YOU FEEL SURE WILL DOGREAT GOOD
 I WISH I COULD AWAKE WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE EVERY MORNING
THERE SEEMS TO BE SO MUCH TROUBLE TAKEN THAT ONE CAN HARDLY SEE THEGOOD OF
THERE WAS A MELANCHOLY CADENCE IN DOROTHEAS VOICE AS SHE SPOKE THESELAST WORDS
 BUT SHE PRESENTLY ADDED MORE CHEERFULLY PRAY COME TOLOWICK AND TELL US MORE OF THIS
 I WILL MENTION THE SUBJECT TO MR
CASAUBON
 I MUST HASTEN HOME NOW
SHE DID MENTION IT THAT EVENING AND SAID THAT SHE SHOULD LIKE TOSUBSCRIBE TWO HUNDRED AYEARSHE HAD SEVEN HUNDRED AYEAR AS THEEQUIVALENT OF HER OWN FORTUNE SETTLED ON HER AT HER MARRIAGE
 MR
CASAUBON MADE NO OBJECTION BEYOND A PASSING REMARK THAT THE SUM MIGHTBE DISPROPORTIONATE IN RELATION TO OTHER GOOD OBJECTS BUT WHENDOROTHEA IN HER IGNORANCE RESISTED THAT SUGGESTION HE ACQUIESCED
 HEDID NOT CARE HIMSELF ABOUT SPENDING MONEY AND WAS NOT RELUCTANT TOGIVE IT
 IF HE EVER FELT KEENLY ANY QUESTION OF MONEY IT WAS THROUGHTHE MEDIUM OF ANOTHER PASSION THAN THE LOVE OF MATERIAL PROPERTY
DOROTHEA TOLD HIM THAT SHE HAD SEEN LYDGATE AND RECITED THE GIST OFHER CONVERSATION WITH HIM ABOUT THE HOSPITAL
 MR
 CASAUBON DID NOTQUESTION HER FURTHER BUT HE FELT SURE THAT SHE HAD WISHED TO KNOW WHATHAD PASSED BETWEEN LYDGATE AND HIMSELF
 SHE KNOWS THAT I KNOW SAIDTHE EVERRESTLESS VOICE WITHIN BUT THAT INCREASE OF TACIT KNOWLEDGEONLY THRUST FURTHER OFF ANY CONFIDENCE BETWEEN THEM
 HE DISTRUSTED HERAFFECTION AND WHAT LONELINESS IS MORE LONELY THAN DISTRUST
CHAPTER XLV
IT IS THE HUMOR OF MANY HEADS TO EXTOL THE DAYS OF THEIR FOREFATHERSAND DECLAIM AGAINST THE WICKEDNESS OF TIMES PRESENT
 WHICHNOTWITHSTANDING THEY CANNOT HANDSOMELY DO WITHOUT THE BORROWED HELPAND SATIRE OF TIMES PAST CONDEMNING THE VICES OF THEIR OWN TIMES BYTHE EXPRESSIONS OF VICES IN TIMES WHICH THEY COMMEND WHICH CANNOT BUTARGUE THE COMMUNITY OF VICE IN BOTH
 HORACE THEREFORE JUVENAL ANDPERSIUS WERE NO PROPHETS ALTHOUGH THEIR LINES DID SEEM TO INDIGITATEAND POINT AT OUR TIMES
SIR THOMAS BROWNE PSEUDODOXIA EPIDEMICA
THAT OPPOSITION TO THE NEW FEVER HOSPITAL WHICH LYDGATE HAD SKETCHED TODOROTHEA WAS LIKE OTHER OPPOSITIONS TO BE VIEWED IN MANY DIFFERENTLIGHTS
 HE REGARDED IT AS A MIXTURE OF JEALOUSY AND DUNDERHEADEDPREJUDICE
 MR
 BULSTRODE SAW IN IT NOT ONLY MEDICAL JEALOUSY BUT ADETERMINATION TO THWART HIMSELF PROMPTED MAINLY BY A HATRED OF THATVITAL RELIGION OF WHICH HE HAD STRIVEN TO BE AN EFFECTUAL LAYREPRESENTATIVEA HATRED WHICH CERTAINLY FOUND PRETEXTS APART FROMRELIGION SUCH AS WERE ONLY TOO EASY TO FIND IN THE ENTANGLEMENTS OFHUMAN ACTION
 THESE MIGHT BE CALLED THE MINISTERIAL VIEWS
 BUTOPPOSITIONS HAVE THE ILLIMITABLE RANGE OF OBJECTIONS AT COMMAND WHICHNEED NEVER STOP SHORT AT THE BOUNDARY OF KNOWLEDGE BUT CAN DRAWFOREVER ON THE VASTS OF IGNORANCE
 WHAT THE OPPOSITION IN MIDDLEMARCHSAID ABOUT THE NEW HOSPITAL AND ITS ADMINISTRATION HAD CERTAINLY AGREAT DEAL OF ECHO IN IT FOR HEAVEN HAS TAKEN CARE THAT EVERYBODYSHALL NOT BE AN ORIGINATOR BUT THERE WERE DIFFERENCES WHICHREPRESENTED EVERY SOCIAL SHADE BETWEEN THE POLISHED MODERATION OF DR
MINCHIN AND THE TRENCHANT ASSERTION OF MRS
 DOLLOP THE LANDLADY OF THETANKARD IN SLAUGHTER LANE
MRS
 DOLLOP BECAME MORE AND MORE CONVINCED BY HER OWN ASSEVERATIONTHAT DR
 LYDGATE MEANT TO LET THE PEOPLE DIE IN THE HOSPITAL IF NOT TOPOISON THEM FOR THE SAKE OF CUTTING THEM UP WITHOUT SAYING BY YOURLEAVE OR WITH YOUR LEAVE FOR IT WAS A KNOWN FAC THAT HE HAD WANTEDTO CUT UP MRS
 GOBY AS RESPECTABLE A WOMAN AS ANY IN PARLEY STREETWHO HAD MONEY IN TRUST BEFORE HER MARRIAGEA POOR TALE FOR A DOCTORWHO IF HE WAS GOOD FOR ANYTHING SHOULD KNOW WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITHYOU BEFORE YOU DIED AND NOT WANT TO PRY INTO YOUR INSIDE AFTER YOUWERE GONE
 IF THAT WAS NOT REASON MRS
 DOLLOP WISHED TO KNOW WHAT WASBUT THERE WAS A PREVALENT FEELING IN HER AUDIENCE THAT HER OPINION WASA BULWARK AND THAT IF IT WERE OVERTHROWN THERE WOULD BE NO LIMITS TOTHE CUTTINGUP OF BODIES AS HAD BEEN WELL SEEN IN BURKE AND HARE WITHTHEIR PITCHPLAISTERSSUCH A HANGING BUSINESS AS THAT WAS NOT WANTED INMIDDLEMARCH
AND LET IT NOT BE SUPPOSED THAT OPINION AT THE TANKARD IN SLAUGHTERLANE WAS UNIMPORTANT TO THE MEDICAL PROFESSION THAT OLD AUTHENTICPUBLICHOUSETHE ORIGINAL TANKARD KNOWN BY THE NAME OF DOLLOPSWASTHE RESORT OF A GREAT BENEFIT CLUB WHICH HAD SOME MONTHS BEFORE PUT TOTHE VOTE WHETHER ITS LONGSTANDING MEDICAL MAN DOCTOR GAMBIT SHOULDNOT BE CASHIERED IN FAVOR OF THIS DOCTOR LYDGATE WHO WAS CAPABLE OFPERFORMING THE MOST ASTONISHING CURES AND RESCUING PEOPLE ALTOGETHERGIVEN UP BY OTHER PRACTITIONERS
 BUT THE BALANCE HAD BEEN TURNEDAGAINST LYDGATE BY TWO MEMBERS WHO FOR SOME PRIVATE REASONS HELD THATTHIS POWER OF RESUSCITATING PERSONS AS GOOD AS DEAD WAS AN EQUIVOCALRECOMMENDATION AND MIGHT INTERFERE WITH PROVIDENTIAL FAVORS
 IN THECOURSE OF THE YEAR HOWEVER THERE HAD BEEN A CHANGE IN THE PUBLICSENTIMENT OF WHICH THE UNANIMITY AT DOLLOPS WAS AN INDEX
A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN A YEAR AGO BEFORE ANYTHING WAS KNOWN OFLYDGATES SKILL THE JUDGMENTS ON IT HAD NATURALLY BEEN DIVIDEDDEPENDING ON A SENSE OF LIKELIHOOD SITUATED PERHAPS IN THE PIT OF THESTOMACH OR IN THE PINEAL GLAND AND DIFFERING IN ITS VERDICTS BUT NOTTHE LESS VALUABLE AS A GUIDE IN THE TOTAL DEFICIT OF EVIDENCE
 PATIENTSWHO HAD CHRONIC DISEASES OR WHOSE LIVES HAD LONG BEEN WORN THREADBARELIKE OLD FEATHERSTONES HAD BEEN AT ONCE INCLINED TO TRY HIM ALSOMANY WHO DID NOT LIKE PAYING THEIR DOCTORS BILLS THOUGHT AGREEABLY OFOPENING AN ACCOUNT WITH A NEW DOCTOR AND SENDING FOR HIM WITHOUT STINTIF THE CHILDRENS TEMPER WANTED A DOSE OCCASIONS WHEN THE OLDPRACTITIONERS WERE OFTEN CRUSTY AND ALL PERSONS THUS INCLINED TOEMPLOY LYDGATE HELD IT LIKELY THAT HE WAS CLEVER
 SOME CONSIDERED THATHE MIGHT DO MORE THAN OTHERS WHERE THERE WAS LIVERAT LEAST THEREWOULD BE NO HARM IN GETTING A FEW BOTTLES OF STUFF FROM HIM SINCE IFTHESE PROVED USELESS IT WOULD STILL BE POSSIBLE TO RETURN TO THEPURIFYING PILLS WHICH KEPT YOU ALIVE IF THEY DID NOT REMOVE THEYELLOWNESS
 BUT THESE WERE PEOPLE OF MINOR IMPORTANCE
 GOOD MIDDLEMARCHFAMILIES WERE OF COURSE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THEIR DOCTOR WITHOUT REASONSHOWN AND EVERYBODY WHO HAD EMPLOYED MR
 PEACOCK DID NOT FEEL OBLIGEDTO ACCEPT A NEW MAN MERELY IN THE CHARACTER OF HIS SUCCESSOR OBJECTINGTHAT HE WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE EQUAL TO PEACOCK
BUT LYDGATE HAD NOT BEEN LONG IN THE TOWN BEFORE THERE WERE PARTICULARSENOUGH REPORTED OF HIM TO BREED MUCH MORE SPECIFIC EXPECTATIONS AND TOINTENSIFY DIFFERENCES INTO PARTISANSHIP SOME OF THE PARTICULARS BEINGOF THAT IMPRESSIVE ORDER OF WHICH THE SIGNIFICANCE IS ENTIRELY HIDDENLIKE A STATISTICAL AMOUNT WITHOUT A STANDARD OF COMPARISON BUT WITH ANOTE OF EXCLAMATION AT THE END
 THE CUBIC FEET OF OXYGEN YEARLYSWALLOWED BY A FULLGROWN MANWHAT A SHUDDER THEY MIGHT HAVE CREATED INSOME MIDDLEMARCH CIRCLES
 OXYGEN
 NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT MAY BEIS ITANY WONDER THE CHOLERA HAS GOT TO DANTZIC
 AND YET THERE ARE PEOPLE WHOSAY QUARANTINE IS NO GOOD
ONE OF THE FACTS QUICKLY RUMORED WAS THAT LYDGATE DID NOT DISPENSEDRUGS
 THIS WAS OFFENSIVE BOTH TO THE PHYSICIANS WHOSE EXCLUSIVEDISTINCTION SEEMED INFRINGED ON AND TO THE SURGEONAPOTHECARIES WITHWHOM HE RANGED HIMSELF AND ONLY A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE THEY MIGHT HAVECOUNTED ON HAVING THE LAW ON THEIR SIDE AGAINST A MAN WHO WITHOUTCALLING HIMSELF A LONDONMADE M
D
 DARED TO ASK FOR PAY EXCEPT AS ACHARGE ON DRUGS
 BUT LYDGATE HAD NOT BEEN EXPERIENCED ENOUGH TO FORESEETHAT HIS NEW COURSE WOULD BE EVEN MORE OFFENSIVE TO THE LAITY AND TOMR
 MAWMSEY AN IMPORTANT GROCER IN THE TOP MARKET WHO THOUGH NOT ONEOF HIS PATIENTS QUESTIONED HIM IN AN AFFABLE MANNER ON THE SUBJECT HEWAS INJUDICIOUS ENOUGH TO GIVE A HASTY POPULAR EXPLANATION OF HISREASONS POINTING OUT TO MR
 MAWMSEY THAT IT MUST LOWER THE CHARACTEROF PRACTITIONERS AND BE A CONSTANT INJURY TO THE PUBLIC IF THEIR ONLYMODE OF GETTING PAID FOR THEIR WORK WAS BY THEIR MAKING OUT LONG BILLSFOR DRAUGHTS BOLUSES AND MIXTURES
IT IS IN THAT WAY THAT HARDWORKING MEDICAL MEN MAY COME TO BE ALMOSTAS MISCHIEVOUS AS QUACKS SAID LYDGATE RATHER THOUGHTLESSLY
 TO GETTHEIR OWN BREAD THEY MUST OVERDOSE THE KINGS LIEGES AND THATS A BADSORT OF TREASON MR
 MAWMSEYUNDERMINES THE CONSTITUTION IN A FATALWAY
MR
 MAWMSEY WAS NOT ONLY AN OVERSEER IT WAS ABOUT A QUESTION OFOUTDOOR PAY THAT HE WAS HAVING AN INTERVIEW WITH LYDGATE HE WAS ALSOASTHMATIC AND HAD AN INCREASING FAMILY THUS FROM A MEDICAL POINT OFVIEW AS WELL AS FROM HIS OWN HE WAS AN IMPORTANT MAN INDEED ANEXCEPTIONAL GROCER WHOSE HAIR WAS ARRANGED IN A FLAMELIKE PYRAMIDAND WHOSE RETAIL DEFERENCE WAS OF THE CORDIAL ENCOURAGINGKINDJOCOSELY COMPLIMENTARY AND WITH A CERTAIN CONSIDERATE ABSTINENCEFROM LETTING OUT THE FULL FORCE OF HIS MIND
 IT WAS MR
 MAWMSEYSFRIENDLY JOCOSENESS IN QUESTIONING HIM WHICH HAD SET THE TONE OFLYDGATES REPLY
 BUT LET THE WISE BE WARNED AGAINST TOO GREAT READINESSAT EXPLANATION IT MULTIPLIES THE SOURCES OF MISTAKE LENGTHENING THESUM FOR RECKONERS SURE TO GO WRONG
LYDGATE SMILED AS HE ENDED HIS SPEECH PUTTING HIS FOOT INTO THESTIRRUP AND MR
 MAWMSEY LAUGHED MORE THAN HE WOULD HAVE DONE IF HE HADKNOWN WHO THE KINGS LIEGES WERE GIVING HIS GOOD MORNING SIRGOODMORNING SIR WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO SAW EVERYTHING CLEARLYENOUGH
 BUT IN TRUTH HIS VIEWS WERE PERTURBED
 FOR YEARS HE HAD BEENPAYING BILLS WITH STRICTLY MADE ITEMS SO THAT FOR EVERY HALFCROWN ANDEIGHTEENPENCE HE WAS CERTAIN SOMETHING MEASURABLE HAD BEEN DELIVERED
HE HAD DONE THIS WITH SATISFACTION INCLUDING IT AMONG HISRESPONSIBILITIES AS A HUSBAND AND FATHER AND REGARDING A LONGER BILLTHAN USUAL AS A DIGNITY WORTH MENTIONING
 MOREOVER IN ADDITION TO THEMASSIVE BENEFIT OF THE DRUGS TO SELF AND FAMILY HE HAD ENJOYED THEPLEASURE OF FORMING AN ACUTE JUDGMENT AS TO THEIR IMMEDIATE EFFECTS SOAS TO GIVE AN INTELLIGENT STATEMENT FOR THE GUIDANCE OF MR
 GAMBITAPRACTITIONER JUST A LITTLE LOWER IN STATUS THAN WRENCH OR TOLLER ANDESPECIALLY ESTEEMED AS AN ACCOUCHEUR OF WHOSE ABILITY MR
 MAWMSEY HADTHE POOREST OPINION ON ALL OTHER POINTS BUT IN DOCTORING HE WAS WONTTO SAY IN AN UNDERTONE HE PLACED GAMBIT ABOVE ANY OF THEM
HERE WERE DEEPER REASONS THAN THE SUPERFICIAL TALK OF A NEW MAN WHICHAPPEARED STILL FLIMSIER IN THE DRAWINGROOM OVER THE SHOP WHEN THEYWERE RECITED TO MRS
 MAWMSEY A WOMAN ACCUSTOMED TO BE MADE MUCH OF ASA FERTILE MOTHERGENERALLY UNDER ATTENDANCE MORE OR LESS FREQUENT FROMMR
 GAMBIT AND OCCASIONALLY HAVING ATTACKS WHICH REQUIRED DR
 MINCHIN
DOES THIS MR
 LYDGATE MEAN TO SAY THERE IS NO USE IN TAKING MEDICINE
SAID MRS
 MAWMSEY WHO WAS SLIGHTLY GIVEN TO DRAWLING
 I SHOULD LIKEHIM TO TELL ME HOW I COULD BEAR UP AT FAIR TIME IF I DIDNT TAKESTRENGTHENING MEDICINE FOR A MONTH BEFOREHAND
 THINK OF WHAT I HAVE TOPROVIDE FOR CALLING CUSTOMERS MY DEAR
HERE MRS
 MAWMSEY TURNED TO ANINTIMATE FEMALE FRIEND WHO SAT BYA LARGE VEAL PIEA STUFFED FILLETAROUND OF BEEFHAM TONGUE ET CETERA ET CETERA
 BUT WHAT KEEPS ME UPBEST IS THE PINK MIXTURE NOT THE BROWN
 I WONDER MR
 MAWMSEY WITHYOUR EXPERIENCE YOU COULD HAVE PATIENCE TO LISTEN
 I SHOULD HAVETOLD HIM AT ONCE THAT I KNEW A LITTLE BETTER THAN THAT
NO NO NO SAID MR
 MAWMSEY I WAS NOT GOING TO TELL HIM MYOPINION
 HEAR EVERYTHING AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF IS MY MOTTO
 BUT HEDIDNT KNOW WHO HE WAS TALKING TO
 I WAS NOT TO BE TURNED ON HISFINGER
 PEOPLE OFTEN PRETEND TO TELL ME THINGS WHEN THEY MIGHT AS WELLSAY MAWMSEY YOURE A FOOL
 BUT I SMILE AT IT I HUMOR EVERYBODYSWEAK PLACE
 IF PHYSIC HAD DONE HARM TO SELF AND FAMILY I SHOULD HAVEFOUND IT OUT BY THIS TIME
THE NEXT DAY MR
 GAMBIT WAS TOLD THAT LYDGATE WENT ABOUT SAYING PHYSICWAS OF NO USE
INDEED
 SAID HE LIFTING HIS EYEBROWS WITH CAUTIOUS SURPRISE
 HE WASA STOUT HUSKY MAN WITH A LARGE RING ON HIS FOURTH FINGER
 HOW WILL HECURE HIS PATIENTS THEN
THAT IS WHAT I SAY RETURNED MRS
 MAWMSEY WHO HABITUALLY GAVE WEIGHTTO HER SPEECH BY LOADING HER PRONOUNS
 DOES HE SUPPOSE THAT PEOPLEWILL PAY HIM ONLY TO COME AND SIT WITH THEM AND GO AWAY AGAIN
MRS
 MAWMSEY HAD HAD A GREAT DEAL OF SITTING FROM MR
 GAMBIT INCLUDINGVERY FULL ACCOUNTS OF HIS OWN HABITS OF BODY AND OTHER AFFAIRS BUT OFCOURSE HE KNEW THERE WAS NO INNUENDO IN HER REMARK SINCE HIS SPARETIME AND PERSONAL NARRATIVE HAD NEVER BEEN CHARGED FOR
 SO HE REPLIEDHUMOROUSLYWELL LYDGATE IS A GOODLOOKING YOUNG FELLOW YOU KNOW
NOT ONE THAT I WOULD EMPLOY SAID MRS
 MAWMSEY
 OTHERS MAY DO ASTHEY PLEASE
HENCE MR
 GAMBIT COULD GO AWAY FROM THE CHIEF GROCERS WITHOUT FEAR OFRIVALRY BUT NOT WITHOUT A SENSE THAT LYDGATE WAS ONE OF THOSEHYPOCRITES WHO TRY TO DISCREDIT OTHERS BY ADVERTISING THEIR OWNHONESTY AND THAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH SOME PEOPLES WHILE TO SHOW HIM UP
MR
 GAMBIT HOWEVER HAD A SATISFACTORY PRACTICE MUCH PERVADED BY THESMELLS OF RETAIL TRADING WHICH SUGGESTED THE REDUCTION OF CASH PAYMENTSTO A BALANCE
 AND HE DID NOT THINK IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO SHOW LYDGATEUP UNTIL HE KNEW HOW
 HE HAD NOT INDEED GREAT RESOURCES OF EDUCATIONAND HAD HAD TO WORK HIS OWN WAY AGAINST A GOOD DEAL OF PROFESSIONALCONTEMPT BUT HE MADE NONE THE WORSE ACCOUCHEUR FOR CALLING THEBREATHING APPARATUS LONGS
OTHER MEDICAL MEN FELT THEMSELVES MORE CAPABLE
 MR
 TOLLER SHARED THEHIGHEST PRACTICE IN THE TOWN AND BELONGED TO AN OLD MIDDLEMARCH FAMILYTHERE WERE TOLLERS IN THE LAW AND EVERYTHING ELSE ABOVE THE LINE OFRETAIL TRADE
 UNLIKE OUR IRASCIBLE FRIEND WRENCH HE HAD THE EASIESTWAY IN THE WORLD OF TAKING THINGS WHICH MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO ANNOY HIMBEING A WELLBRED QUIETLY FACETIOUS MAN WHO KEPT A GOOD HOUSE WASVERY FOND OF A LITTLE SPORTING WHEN HE COULD GET IT VERY FRIENDLY WITHMR
 HAWLEY AND HOSTILE TO MR
 BULSTRODE
 IT MAY SEEM ODD THAT WITHSUCH PLEASANT HABITS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THE HEROIC TREATMENTBLEEDING AND BLISTERING AND STARVING HIS PATIENTS WITH A DISPASSIONATEDISREGARD TO HIS PERSONAL EXAMPLE BUT THE INCONGRUITY FAVORED THEOPINION OF HIS ABILITY AMONG HIS PATIENTS WHO COMMONLY OBSERVED THATMR
 TOLLER HAD LAZY MANNERS BUT HIS TREATMENT WAS AS ACTIVE AS YOUCOULD DESIRE NO MAN SAID THEY CARRIED MORE SERIOUSNESS INTO HISPROFESSION HE WAS A LITTLE SLOW IN COMING BUT WHEN HE CAME HE DIDSOMETHING
 HE WAS A GREAT FAVORITE IN HIS OWN CIRCLE AND WHATEVER HEIMPLIED TO ANY ONES DISADVANTAGE TOLD DOUBLY FROM HIS CARELESSIRONICAL TONE
HE NATURALLY GOT TIRED OF SMILING AND SAYING AH
 WHEN HE WAS TOLDTHAT MR
 PEACOCKS SUCCESSOR DID NOT MEAN TO DISPENSE MEDICINES ANDMR
 HACKBUTT ONE DAY MENTIONING IT OVER THE WINE AT A DINNERPARTY MR
TOLLER SAID LAUGHINGLY DIBBITTS WILL GET RID OF HIS STALE DRUGSTHEN
 IM FOND OF LITTLE DIBBITTSIM GLAD HES IN LUCK
I SEE YOUR MEANING TOLLER SAID MR
 HACKBUTT AND I AM ENTIRELY OFYOUR OPINION
 I SHALL TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXPRESSING MYSELF TO THATEFFECT
 A MEDICAL MAN SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE QUALITY OF THEDRUGS CONSUMED BY HIS PATIENTS
 THAT IS THE RATIONALE OF THE SYSTEM OFCHARGING WHICH HAS HITHERTO OBTAINED AND NOTHING IS MORE OFFENSIVETHAN THIS OSTENTATION OF REFORM WHERE THERE IS NO REAL AMELIORATION
OSTENTATION HACKBUTT
 SAID MR
 TOLLER IRONICALLY
 I DONT SEETHAT
 A MAN CANT VERY WELL BE OSTENTATIOUS OF WHAT NOBODY BELIEVES IN
THERES NO REFORM IN THE MATTER THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE PROFIT ONTHE DRUGS IS PAID TO THE MEDICAL MAN BY THE DRUGGIST OR BY THE PATIENTAND WHETHER THERE SHALL BE EXTRA PAY UNDER THE NAME OF ATTENDANCE
AH TO BE SURE ONE OF YOUR DAMNED NEW VERSIONS OF OLD HUMBUG SAIDMR
 HAWLEY PASSING THE DECANTER TO MR
 WRENCH
MR
 WRENCH GENERALLY ABSTEMIOUS OFTEN DRANK WINE RATHER FREELY AT APARTY GETTING THE MORE IRRITABLE IN CONSEQUENCE
AS TO HUMBUG HAWLEY HE SAID THATS A WORD EASY TO FLING ABOUT
BUT WHAT I CONTEND AGAINST IS THE WAY MEDICAL MEN ARE FOULING THEIR OWNNEST AND SETTING UP A CRY ABOUT THE COUNTRY AS IF A GENERALPRACTITIONER WHO DISPENSES DRUGS COULDNT BE A GENTLEMAN
 I THROW BACKTHE IMPUTATION WITH SCORN
 I SAY THE MOST UNGENTLEMANLY TRICK A MANCAN BE GUILTY OF IS TO COME AMONG THE MEMBERS OF HIS PROFESSION WITHINNOVATIONS WHICH ARE A LIBEL ON THEIR TIMEHONORED PROCEDURE
 THAT ISMY OPINION AND I AM READY TO MAINTAIN IT AGAINST ANY ONE WHOCONTRADICTS ME
 MR
 WRENCHS VOICE HAD BECOME EXCEEDINGLY SHARP
I CANT OBLIGE YOU THERE WRENCH SAID MR
 HAWLEY THRUSTING HISHANDS INTO HIS TROUSERPOCKETS
MY DEAR FELLOW SAID MR
 TOLLER STRIKING IN PACIFICALLY AND LOOKINGAT MR
 WRENCH THE PHYSICIANS HAVE THEIR TOES TRODDEN ON MORE THAN WEHAVE
 IF YOU COME TO DIGNITY IT IS A QUESTION FOR MINCHIN AND SPRAGUE
DOES MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE PROVIDE NOTHING AGAINST THESEINFRINGEMENTS
 SAID MR
 HACKBUTT WITH A DISINTERESTED DESIRE TO OFFERHIS LIGHTS
 HOW DOES THE LAW STAND EH HAWLEY
NOTHING TO BE DONE THERE SAID MR
 HAWLEY
 I LOOKED INTO IT FORSPRAGUE
 YOUD ONLY BREAK YOUR NOSE AGAINST A DAMNED JUDGES DECISION
POOH
 NO NEED OF LAW SAID MR
 TOLLER
 SO FAR AS PRACTICE ISCONCERNED THE ATTEMPT IS AN ABSURDITY
 NO PATIENT WILL LIKEITCERTAINLY NOT PEACOCKS WHO HAVE BEEN USED TO DEPLETION
 PASS THEWINE
MR
 TOLLERS PREDICTION WAS PARTLY VERIFIED
 IF MR
 AND MRS
 MAWMSEYWHO HAD NO IDEA OF EMPLOYING LYDGATE WERE MADE UNEASY BY HIS SUPPOSEDDECLARATION AGAINST DRUGS IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT THOSE WHO CALLED HIMIN SHOULD WATCH A LITTLE ANXIOUSLY TO SEE WHETHER HE DID USE ALL THEMEANS HE MIGHT USE IN THE CASE
 EVEN GOOD MR
 POWDERELL WHO IN HISCONSTANT CHARITY OF INTERPRETATION WAS INCLINED TO ESTEEM LYDGATE THEMORE FOR WHAT SEEMED A CONSCIENTIOUS PURSUIT OF A BETTER PLAN HAD HISMIND DISTURBED WITH DOUBTS DURING HIS WIFES ATTACK OF ERYSIPELAS ANDCOULD NOT ABSTAIN FROM MENTIONING TO LYDGATE THAT MR
 PEACOCK ON ASIMILAR OCCASION HAD ADMINISTERED A SERIES OF BOLUSES WHICH WERE NOTOTHERWISE DEFINABLE THAN BY THEIR REMARKABLE EFFECT IN BRINGING MRS
POWDERELL ROUND BEFORE MICHAELMAS FROM AN ILLNESS WHICH HAD BEGUN IN AREMARKABLY HOT AUGUST
 AT LAST INDEED IN THE CONFLICT BETWEEN HISDESIRE NOT TO HURT LYDGATE AND HIS ANXIETY THAT NO MEANS SHOULD BELACKING HE INDUCED HIS WIFE PRIVATELY TO TAKE WIDGEONS PURIFYINGPILLS AN ESTEEMED MIDDLEMARCH MEDICINE WHICH ARRESTED EVERY DISEASEAT THE FOUNTAIN BY SETTING TO WORK AT ONCE UPON THE BLOOD
 THISCOOPERATIVE MEASURE WAS NOT TO BE MENTIONED TO LYDGATE AND MR
POWDERELL HIMSELF HAD NO CERTAIN RELIANCE ON IT ONLY HOPING THAT ITMIGHT BE ATTENDED WITH A BLESSING
BUT IN THIS DOUBTFUL STAGE OF LYDGATES INTRODUCTION HE WAS HELPED BYWHAT WE MORTALS RASHLY CALL GOOD FORTUNE
 I SUPPOSE NO DOCTOR EVER CAMENEWLY TO A PLACE WITHOUT MAKING CURES THAT SURPRISED SOMEBODYCURESWHICH MAY BE CALLED FORTUNES TESTIMONIALS AND DESERVE AS MUCH CREDITAS THE WRITTEN OR PRINTED KIND
 VARIOUS PATIENTS GOT WELL WHILE LYDGATEWAS ATTENDING THEM SOME EVEN OF DANGEROUS ILLNESSES AND IT WASREMARKED THAT THE NEW DOCTOR WITH HIS NEW WAYS HAD AT LEAST THE MERITOF BRINGING PEOPLE BACK FROM THE BRINK OF DEATH
 THE TRASH TALKED ONSUCH OCCASIONS WAS THE MORE VEXATIOUS TO LYDGATE BECAUSE IT GAVEPRECISELY THE SORT OF PRESTIGE WHICH AN INCOMPETENT AND UNSCRUPULOUSMAN WOULD DESIRE AND WAS SURE TO BE IMPUTED TO HIM BY THE SIMMERINGDISLIKE OF THE OTHER MEDICAL MEN AS AN ENCOURAGEMENT ON HIS OWN PART OFIGNORANT PUFFING
 BUT EVEN HIS PROUD OUTSPOKENNESS WAS CHECKED BY THEDISCERNMENT THAT IT WAS AS USELESS TO FIGHT AGAINST THE INTERPRETATIONSOF IGNORANCE AS TO WHIP THE FOG AND GOOD FORTUNE INSISTED ON USINGTHOSE INTERPRETATIONS
MRS
 LARCHER HAVING JUST BECOME CHARITABLY CONCERNED ABOUT ALARMINGSYMPTOMS IN HER CHARWOMAN WHEN DR
 MINCHIN CALLED ASKED HIM TO SEEHER THEN AND THERE AND TO GIVE HER A CERTIFICATE FOR THE INFIRMARYWHEREUPON AFTER EXAMINATION HE WROTE A STATEMENT OF THE CASE AS ONE OFTUMOR AND RECOMMENDED THE BEARER NANCY NASH AS AN OUTPATIENT
 NANCYCALLING AT HOME ON HER WAY TO THE INFIRMARY ALLOWED THE STAY MAKER ANDHIS WIFE IN WHOSE ATTIC SHE LODGED TO READ DR
 MINCHINS PAPER ANDBY THIS MEANS BECAME A SUBJECT OF COMPASSIONATE CONVERSATION IN THENEIGHBORING SHOPS OF CHURCHYARD LANE AS BEING AFFLICTED WITH A TUMOR ATFIRST DECLARED TO BE AS LARGE AND HARD AS A DUCKS EGG BUT LATER INTHE DAY TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF YOUR FIST
 MOST HEARERS AGREED THATIT WOULD HAVE TO BE CUT OUT BUT ONE HAD KNOWN OF OIL AND ANOTHER OFSQUITCHINEAL AS ADEQUATE TO SOFTEN AND REDUCE ANY LUMP IN THE BODYWHEN TAKEN ENOUGH OF INTO THE INSIDETHE OIL BY GRADUALLY SOOPLINGTHE SQUITCHINEAL BY EATING AWAY
MEANWHILE WHEN NANCY PRESENTED HERSELF AT THE INFIRMARY IT HAPPENED TOBE ONE OF LYDGATES DAYS THERE
 AFTER QUESTIONING AND EXAMINING HERLYDGATE SAID TO THE HOUSESURGEON IN AN UNDERTONE ITS NOT TUMORITS CRAMP
 HE ORDERED HER A BLISTER AND SOME STEEL MIXTURE AND TOLDHER TO GO HOME AND REST GIVING HER AT THE SAME TIME A NOTE TO MRS
LARCHER WHO SHE SAID WAS HER BEST EMPLOYER TO TESTIFY THAT SHE WASIN NEED OF GOOD FOOD
BUT BYANDBY NANCY IN HER ATTIC BECAME PORTENTOUSLY WORSE THESUPPOSED TUMOR HAVING INDEED GIVEN WAY TO THE BLISTER BUT ONLYWANDERED TO ANOTHER REGION WITH ANGRIER PAIN
 THE STAYMAKERS WIFE WENTTO FETCH LYDGATE AND HE CONTINUED FOR A FORTNIGHT TO ATTEND NANCY INHER OWN HOME UNTIL UNDER HIS TREATMENT SHE GOT QUITE WELL AND WENT TOWORK AGAIN
 BUT THE CASE CONTINUED TO BE DESCRIBED AS ONE OF TUMOR INCHURCHYARD LANE AND OTHER STREETSNAY BY MRS
 LARCHER ALSO FOR WHENLYDGATES REMARKABLE CURE WAS MENTIONED TO DR
 MINCHIN HE NATURALLYDID NOT LIKE TO SAY THE CASE WAS NOT ONE OF TUMOR AND I WAS MISTAKENIN DESCRIBING IT AS SUCH BUT ANSWERED INDEED
 AH
 I SAW IT WAS ASURGICAL CASE NOT OF A FATAL KIND
 HE HAD BEEN INWARDLY ANNOYEDHOWEVER WHEN HE HAD ASKED AT THE INFIRMARY ABOUT THE WOMAN HE HADRECOMMENDED TWO DAYS BEFORE TO HEAR FROM THE HOUSESURGEON AYOUNGSTER WHO WAS NOT SORRY TO VEX MINCHIN WITH IMPUNITY EXACTLY WHATHAD OCCURRED HE PRIVATELY PRONOUNCED THAT IT WAS INDECENT IN A GENERALPRACTITIONER TO CONTRADICT A PHYSICIANS DIAGNOSIS IN THAT OPEN MANNERAND AFTERWARDS AGREED WITH WRENCH THAT LYDGATE WAS DISAGREEABLYINATTENTIVE TO ETIQUETTE
 LYDGATE DID NOT MAKE THE AFFAIR A GROUND FORVALUING HIMSELF OR VERY PARTICULARLY DESPISING MINCHIN SUCHRECTIFICATION OF MISJUDGMENTS OFTEN HAPPENING AMONG MEN OF EQUALQUALIFICATIONS
 BUT REPORT TOOK UP THIS AMAZING CASE OF TUMOR NOTCLEARLY DISTINGUISHED FROM CANCER AND CONSIDERED THE MORE AWFUL FORBEING OF THE WANDERING SORT TILL MUCH PREJUDICE AGAINST LYDGATESMETHOD AS TO DRUGS WAS OVERCOME BY THE PROOF OF HIS MARVELLOUS SKILL INTHE SPEEDY RESTORATION OF NANCY NASH AFTER SHE HAD BEEN ROLLING ANDROLLING IN AGONIES FROM THE PRESENCE OF A TUMOR BOTH HARD ANDOBSTINATE BUT NEVERTHELESS COMPELLED TO YIELD
HOW COULD LYDGATE HELP HIMSELF
 IT IS OFFENSIVE TO TELL A LADY WHEN SHEIS EXPRESSING HER AMAZEMENT AT YOUR SKILL THAT SHE IS ALTOGETHERMISTAKEN AND RATHER FOOLISH IN HER AMAZEMENT
 AND TO HAVE ENTERED INTOTHE NATURE OF DISEASES WOULD ONLY HAVE ADDED TO HIS BREACHES OF MEDICALPROPRIETY
 THUS HE HAD TO WINCE UNDER A PROMISE OF SUCCESS GIVEN BYTHAT IGNORANT PRAISE WHICH MISSES EVERY VALID QUALITY
IN THE CASE OF A MORE CONSPICUOUS PATIENT MR
 BORTHROP TRUMBULLLYDGATE WAS CONSCIOUS OF HAVING SHOWN HIMSELF SOMETHING BETTER THAN ANEVERYDAY DOCTOR THOUGH HERE TOO IT WAS AN EQUIVOCAL ADVANTAGE THAT HEWON
 THE ELOQUENT AUCTIONEER WAS SEIZED WITH PNEUMONIA AND HAVING BEENA PATIENT OF MR
 PEACOCKS SENT FOR LYDGATE WHOM HE HAD EXPRESSED HISINTENTION TO PATRONIZE
 MR TRUMBULL WAS A ROBUST MAN A GOOD SUBJECTFOR TRYING THE EXPECTANT THEORY UPONWATCHING THE COURSE OF ANINTERESTING DISEASE WHEN LEFT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO ITSELF SO THATTHE STAGES MIGHT BE NOTED FOR FUTURE GUIDANCE AND FROM THE AIR WITHWHICH HE DESCRIBED HIS SENSATIONS LYDGATE SURMISED THAT HE WOULD LIKETO BE TAKEN INTO HIS MEDICAL MANS CONFIDENCE AND BE REPRESENTED AS APARTNER IN HIS OWN CURE
 THE AUCTIONEER HEARD WITHOUT MUCH SURPRISETHAT HIS WAS A CONSTITUTION WHICH ALWAYS WITH DUE WATCHING MIGHT BELEFT TO ITSELF SO AS TO OFFER A BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE OF A DISEASE WITHALL ITS PHASES SEEN IN CLEAR DELINEATION AND THAT HE PROBABLY HAD THERARE STRENGTH OF MIND VOLUNTARILY TO BECOME THE TEST OF A RATIONALPROCEDURE AND THUS MAKE THE DISORDER OF HIS PULMONARY FUNCTIONS AGENERAL BENEFIT TO SOCIETY
MR
 TRUMBULL ACQUIESCED AT ONCE AND ENTERED STRONGLY INTO THE VIEWTHAT AN ILLNESS OF HIS WAS NO ORDINARY OCCASION FOR MEDICAL SCIENCE
NEVER FEAR SIR YOU ARE NOT SPEAKING TO ONE WHO IS ALTOGETHERIGNORANT OF THE VIS MEDICATRIX SAID HE WITH HIS USUAL SUPERIORITYOF EXPRESSION MADE RATHER PATHETIC BY DIFFICULTY OF BREATHING
 AND HEWENT WITHOUT SHRINKING THROUGH HIS ABSTINENCE FROM DRUGS MUCHSUSTAINED BY APPLICATION OF THE THERMOMETER WHICH IMPLIED THEIMPORTANCE OF HIS TEMPERATURE BY THE SENSE THAT HE FURNISHED OBJECTSFOR THE MICROSCOPE AND BY LEARNING MANY NEW WORDS WHICH SEEMED SUITEDTO THE DIGNITY OF HIS SECRETIONS
 FOR LYDGATE WAS ACUTE ENOUGH TOINDULGE HIM WITH A LITTLE TECHNICAL TALK
IT MAY BE IMAGINED THAT MR
 TRUMBULL ROSE FROM HIS COUCH WITH ADISPOSITION TO SPEAK OF AN ILLNESS IN WHICH HE HAD MANIFESTED THESTRENGTH OF HIS MIND AS WELL AS CONSTITUTION AND HE WAS NOT BACKWARDIN AWARDING CREDIT TO THE MEDICAL MAN WHO HAD DISCERNED THE QUALITY OFPATIENT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH
 THE AUCTIONEER WAS NOT AN UNGENEROUS MANAND LIKED TO GIVE OTHERS THEIR DUE FEELING THAT HE COULD AFFORD IT
 HEHAD CAUGHT THE WORDS EXPECTANT METHOD AND RANG CHIMES ON THIS ANDOTHER LEARNED PHRASES TO ACCOMPANY THE ASSURANCE THAT LYDGATE KNEW ATHING OR TWO MORE THAN THE REST OF THE DOCTORSWAS FAR BETTER VERSED INTHE SECRETS OF HIS PROFESSION THAN THE MAJORITY OF HIS COMPEERS
THIS HAD HAPPENED BEFORE THE AFFAIR OF FRED VINCYS ILLNESS HAD GIVENTO MR
 WRENCHS ENMITY TOWARDS LYDGATE MORE DEFINITE PERSONAL GROUND
THE NEWCOMER ALREADY THREATENED TO BE A NUISANCE IN THE SHAPE OFRIVALRY AND WAS CERTAINLY A NUISANCE IN THE SHAPE OF PRACTICALCRITICISM OR REFLECTIONS ON HIS HARDDRIVEN ELDERS WHO HAD HADSOMETHING ELSE TO DO THAN TO BUSY THEMSELVES WITH UNTRIED NOTIONS
 HISPRACTICE HAD SPREAD IN ONE OR TWO QUARTERS AND FROM THE FIRST THEREPORT OF HIS HIGH FAMILY HAD LED TO HIS BEING PRETTY GENERALLYINVITED SO THAT THE OTHER MEDICAL MEN HAD TO MEET HIM AT DINNER IN THEBEST HOUSES AND HAVING TO MEET A MAN WHOM YOU DISLIKE IS NOT OBSERVEDALWAYS TO END IN A MUTUAL ATTACHMENT
 THERE WAS HARDLY EVER SO MUCHUNANIMITY AMONG THEM AS IN THE OPINION THAT LYDGATE WAS AN ARROGANTYOUNG FELLOW AND YET READY FOR THE SAKE OF ULTIMATELY PREDOMINATING TOSHOW A CRAWLING SUBSERVIENCE TO BULSTRODE
 THAT MR
 FAREBROTHER WHOSENAME WAS A CHIEF FLAG OF THE ANTIBULSTRODE PARTY ALWAYS DEFENDEDLYDGATE AND MADE A FRIEND OF HIM WAS REFERRED TO FAREBROTHERSUNACCOUNTABLE WAY OF FIGHTING ON BOTH SIDES
HERE WAS PLENTY OF PREPARATION FOR THE OUTBURST OF PROFESSIONAL DISGUSTAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE LAWS MR
 BULSTRODE WAS LAYING DOWN FOR THEDIRECTION OF THE NEW HOSPITAL WHICH WERE THE MORE EXASPERATING BECAUSETHERE WAS NO PRESENT POSSIBILITY OF INTERFERING WITH HIS WILL ANDPLEASURE EVERYBODY EXCEPT LORD MEDLICOTE HAVING REFUSED HELP TOWARDSTHE BUILDING ON THE GROUND THAT THEY PREFERRED GIVING TO THE OLDINFIRMARY
 MR
 BULSTRODE MET ALL THE EXPENSES AND HAD CEASED TO BESORRY THAT HE WAS PURCHASING THE RIGHT TO CARRY OUT HIS NOTIONS OFIMPROVEMENT WITHOUT HINDRANCE FROM PREJUDICED COADJUTORS BUT HE HADHAD TO SPEND LARGE SUMS AND THE BUILDING HAD LINGERED
 CALEB GARTH HADUNDERTAKEN IT HAD FAILED DURING ITS PROGRESS AND BEFORE THE INTERIORFITTINGS WERE BEGUN HAD RETIRED FROM THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BUSINESSAND WHEN REFERRING TO THE HOSPITAL HE OFTEN SAID THAT HOWEVER BULSTRODEMIGHT RING IF YOU TRIED HIM HE LIKED GOOD SOLID CARPENTRY AND MASONRYAND HAD A NOTION BOTH OF DRAINS AND CHIMNEYS
 IN FACT THE HOSPITAL HADBECOME AN OBJECT OF INTENSE INTEREST TO BULSTRODE AND HE WOULDWILLINGLY HAVE CONTINUED TO SPARE A LARGE YEARLY SUM THAT HE MIGHT RULEIT DICTATORIALLY WITHOUT ANY BOARD BUT HE HAD ANOTHER FAVORITE OBJECTWHICH ALSO REQUIRED MONEY FOR ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT HE WISHED TO BUY SOMELAND IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF MIDDLEMARCH AND THEREFORE HE WISHED TO GETCONSIDERABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS MAINTAINING THE HOSPITAL
 MEANWHILEHE FRAMED HIS PLAN OF MANAGEMENT
 THE HOSPITAL WAS TO BE RESERVED FORFEVER IN ALL ITS FORMS LYDGATE WAS TO BE CHIEF MEDICAL SUPERINTENDENTTHAT HE MIGHT HAVE FREE AUTHORITY TO PURSUE ALL COMPARATIVEINVESTIGATIONS WHICH HIS STUDIES PARTICULARLY IN PARIS HAD SHOWN HIMTHE IMPORTANCE OF THE OTHER MEDICAL VISITORS HAVING A CONSULTATIVEINFLUENCE BUT NO POWER TO CONTRAVENE LYDGATES ULTIMATE DECISIONS ANDTHE GENERAL MANAGEMENT WAS TO BE LODGED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE HANDS OFFIVE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATED WITH MR
 BULSTRODE WHO WERE TO HAVE VOTES INTHE RATIO OF THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS THE BOARD ITSELF FILLING UP ANYVACANCY IN ITS NUMBERS AND NO MOB OF SMALL CONTRIBUTORS BEING ADMITTEDTO A SHARE OF GOVERNMENT
THERE WAS AN IMMEDIATE REFUSAL ON THE PART OF EVERY MEDICAL MAN IN THETOWN TO BECOME A VISITOR AT THE FEVER HOSPITAL
VERY WELL SAID LYDGATE TO MR
 BULSTRODE WE HAVE A CAPITALHOUSESURGEON AND DISPENSER A CLEARHEADED NEATHANDED FELLOW WELLGET WEBBE FROM CRABSLEY AS GOOD A COUNTRY PRACTITIONER AS ANY OF THEMTO COME OVER TWICE AWEEK AND IN CASE OF ANY EXCEPTIONAL OPERATIONPROTHEROE WILL COME FROM BRASSING
 I MUST WORK THE HARDER THATS ALLAND I HAVE GIVEN UP MY POST AT THE INFIRMARY
 THE PLAN WILL FLOURISH INSPITE OF THEM AND THEN THEYLL BE GLAD TO COME IN
 THINGS CANT LASTAS THEY ARE THERE MUST BE ALL SORTS OF REFORM SOON AND THEN YOUNGFELLOWS MAY BE GLAD TO COME AND STUDY HERE
 LYDGATE WAS IN HIGHSPIRITS
I SHALL NOT FLINCH YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT MR
 LYDGATE SAID MR
BULSTRODE
 WHILE I SEE YOU CARRYING OUT HIGH INTENTIONS WITH VIGORYOU SHALL HAVE MY UNFAILING SUPPORT
 AND I HAVE HUMBLE CONFIDENCE THATTHE BLESSING WHICH HAS HITHERTO ATTENDED MY EFFORTS AGAINST THE SPIRITOF EVIL IN THIS TOWN WILL NOT BE WITHDRAWN
 SUITABLE DIRECTORS TOASSIST ME I HAVE NO DOUBT OF SECURING
 MR
 BROOKE OF TIPTON HAS ALREADYGIVEN ME HIS CONCURRENCE AND A PLEDGE TO CONTRIBUTE YEARLY HE HAS NOTSPECIFIED THE SUMPROBABLY NOT A GREAT ONE
 BUT HE WILL BE A USEFULMEMBER OF THE BOARD
A USEFUL MEMBER WAS PERHAPS TO BE DEFINED AS ONE WHO WOULD ORIGINATENOTHING AND ALWAYS VOTE WITH MR
 BULSTRODE
THE MEDICAL AVERSION TO LYDGATE WAS HARDLY DISGUISED NOW
 NEITHER DR
SPRAGUE NOR DR
 MINCHIN SAID THAT HE DISLIKED LYDGATES KNOWLEDGE ORHIS DISPOSITION TO IMPROVE TREATMENT WHAT THEY DISLIKED WAS HISARROGANCE WHICH NOBODY FELT TO BE ALTOGETHER DENIABLE
 THEY IMPLIEDTHAT HE WAS INSOLENT PRETENTIOUS AND GIVEN TO THAT RECKLESSINNOVATION FOR THE SAKE OF NOISE AND SHOW WHICH WAS THE ESSENCE OF THECHARLATAN
THE WORD CHARLATAN ONCE THROWN ON THE AIR COULD NOT BE LET DROP
 INTHOSE DAYS THE WORLD WAS AGITATED ABOUT THE WONDROUS DOINGS OF MR
 ST
JOHN LONG NOBLEMEN AND GENTLEMEN ATTESTING HIS EXTRACTION OF A FLUIDLIKE MERCURY FROM THE TEMPLES OF A PATIENT
MR
 TOLLER REMARKED ONE DAY SMILINGLY TO MRS
 TAFT THAT BULSTRODEHAD FOUND A MAN TO SUIT HIM IN LYDGATE A CHARLATAN IN RELIGION IS SURETO LIKE OTHER SORTS OF CHARLATANS
YES INDEED I CAN IMAGINE SAID MRS
 TAFT KEEPING THE NUMBER OFTHIRTY STITCHES CAREFULLY IN HER MIND ALL THE WHILE THERE ARE SO MANYOF THAT SORT
 I REMEMBER MR
 CHESHIRE WITH HIS IRONS TRYING TO MAKEPEOPLE STRAIGHT WHEN THE ALMIGHTY HAD MADE THEM CROOKED
NO NO SAID MR
 TOLLER CHESHIRE WAS ALL RIGHTALL FAIR AND ABOVEBOARD
 BUT THERES ST
 JOHN LONGTHATS THE KIND OF FELLOW WE CALL ACHARLATAN ADVERTISING CURES IN WAYS NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT AFELLOW WHO WANTS TO MAKE A NOISE BY PRETENDING TO GO DEEPER THAN OTHERPEOPLE
 THE OTHER DAY HE WAS PRETENDING TO TAP A MANS BRAIN AND GETQUICKSILVER OUT OF IT
GOOD GRACIOUS
 WHAT DREADFUL TRIFLING WITH PEOPLES CONSTITUTIONS
SAID MRS
 TAFT
AFTER THIS IT CAME TO BE HELD IN VARIOUS QUARTERS THAT LYDGATE PLAYEDEVEN WITH RESPECTABLE CONSTITUTIONS FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES AND HOW MUCHMORE LIKELY THAT IN HIS FLIGHTY EXPERIMENTING HE SHOULD MAKE SIXES ANDSEVENS OF HOSPITAL PATIENTS
 ESPECIALLY IT WAS TO BE EXPECTED AS THELANDLADY OF THE TANKARD HAD SAID THAT HE WOULD RECKLESSLY CUT UP THEIRDEAD BODIES
 FOR LYDGATE HAVING ATTENDED MRS
 GOBY WHO DIED APPARENTLYOF A HEARTDISEASE NOT VERY CLEARLY EXPRESSED IN THE SYMPTOMS TOODARINGLY ASKED LEAVE OF HER RELATIVES TO OPEN THE BODY AND THUS GAVEAN OFFENCE QUICKLY SPREADING BEYOND PARLEY STREET WHERE THAT LADY HADLONG RESIDED ON AN INCOME SUCH AS MADE THIS ASSOCIATION OF HER BODYWITH THE VICTIMS OF BURKE AND HARE A FLAGRANT INSULT TO HER MEMORY
AFFAIRS WERE IN THIS STAGE WHEN LYDGATE OPENED THE SUBJECT OF THEHOSPITAL TO DOROTHEA
 WE SEE THAT HE WAS BEARING ENMITY AND SILLYMISCONCEPTION WITH MUCH SPIRIT AWARE THAT THEY WERE PARTLY CREATED BYHIS GOOD SHARE OF SUCCESS
THEY WILL NOT DRIVE ME AWAY HE SAID TALKING CONFIDENTIALLY IN MR
FAREBROTHERS STUDY
 I HAVE GOT A GOOD OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR THE ENDSI CARE MOST ABOUT AND I AM PRETTY SURE TO GET INCOME ENOUGH FOR OURWANTS
 BYANDBY I SHALL GO ON AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE I HAVE NOSEDUCTIONS NOW AWAY FROM HOME AND WORK
 AND I AM MORE AND MORECONVINCED THAT IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO DEMONSTRATE THE HOMOGENEOUSORIGIN OF ALL THE TISSUES
 RASPAIL AND OTHERS ARE ON THE SAME TRACKAND I HAVE BEEN LOSING TIME
I HAVE NO POWER OF PROPHECY THERE SAID MR
 FAREBROTHER WHO HAD BEENPUFFING AT HIS PIPE THOUGHTFULLY WHILE LYDGATE TALKED BUT AS TO THEHOSTILITY IN THE TOWN YOULL WEATHER IT IF YOU ARE PRUDENT
HOW AM I TO BE PRUDENT
 SAID LYDGATE I JUST DO WHAT COMES BEFORE METO DO
 I CANT HELP PEOPLES IGNORANCE AND SPITE ANY MORE THANVESALIUS COULD
 IT ISNT POSSIBLE TO SQUARE ONES CONDUCT TO SILLYCONCLUSIONS WHICH NOBODY CAN FORESEE
QUITE TRUE I DIDNT MEAN THAT
 I MEANT ONLY TWO THINGS
 ONE IS KEEPYOURSELF AS SEPARABLE FROM BULSTRODE AS YOU CAN OF COURSE YOU CAN GOON DOING GOOD WORK OF YOUR OWN BY HIS HELP BUT DONT GET TIED
 PERHAPSIT SEEMS LIKE PERSONAL FEELING IN ME TO SAY SOAND THERES A GOOD DEALOF THAT I OWNBUT PERSONAL FEELING IS NOT ALWAYS IN THE WRONG IF YOUBOIL IT DOWN TO THE IMPRESSIONS WHICH MAKE IT SIMPLY AN OPINION
BULSTRODE IS NOTHING TO ME SAID LYDGATE CARELESSLY EXCEPT ONPUBLIC GROUNDS
 AS TO GETTING VERY CLOSELY UNITED TO HIM I AM NOT FONDENOUGH OF HIM FOR THAT
 BUT WHAT WAS THE OTHER THING YOU MEANT
 SAIDLYDGATE WHO WAS NURSING HIS LEG AS COMFORTABLY AS POSSIBLE ANDFEELING IN NO GREAT NEED OF ADVICE
WHY THIS
 TAKE CAREEXPERTO CREDETAKE CARE NOT TO GET HAMPEREDABOUT MONEY MATTERS
 I KNOW BY A WORD YOU LET FALL ONE DAY THAT YOUDONT LIKE MY PLAYING AT CARDS SO MUCH FOR MONEY
 YOU ARE RIGHT ENOUGHTHERE
 BUT TRY AND KEEP CLEAR OF WANTING SMALL SUMS THAT YOU HAVENTGOT
 I AM PERHAPS TALKING RATHER SUPERFLUOUSLY BUT A MAN LIKES TOASSUME SUPERIORITY OVER HIMSELF BY HOLDING UP HIS BAD EXAMPLE ANDSERMONIZING ON IT
LYDGATE TOOK MR
 FAREBROTHERS HINTS VERY CORDIALLY THOUGH HE WOULDHARDLY HAVE BORNE THEM FROM ANOTHER MAN
 HE COULD NOT HELP REMEMBERINGTHAT HE HAD LATELY MADE SOME DEBTS BUT THESE HAD SEEMED INEVITABLEAND HE HAD NO INTENTION NOW TO DO MORE THAN KEEP HOUSE IN A SIMPLE WAY
THE FURNITURE FOR WHICH HE OWED WOULD NOT WANT RENEWING NOR EVEN THESTOCK OF WINE FOR A LONG WHILE
MANY THOUGHTS CHEERED HIM AT THAT TIMEAND JUSTLY
 A MAN CONSCIOUS OFENTHUSIASM FOR WORTHY AIMS IS SUSTAINED UNDER PETTY HOSTILITIES BY THEMEMORY OF GREAT WORKERS WHO HAD TO FIGHT THEIR WAY NOT WITHOUT WOUNDSAND WHO HOVER IN HIS MIND AS PATRON SAINTS INVISIBLY HELPING
 AT HOMETHAT SAME EVENING WHEN HE HAD BEEN CHATTING WITH MR
 FAREBROTHER HEHAD HIS LONG LEGS STRETCHED ON THE SOFA HIS HEAD THROWN BACK AND HISHANDS CLASPED BEHIND IT ACCORDING TO HIS FAVORITE RUMINATING ATTITUDEWHILE ROSAMOND SAT AT THE PIANO AND PLAYED ONE TUNE AFTER ANOTHER OFWHICH HER HUSBAND ONLY KNEW LIKE THE EMOTIONAL ELEPHANT HE WAS
 THATTHEY FELL IN WITH HIS MOOD AS IF THEY HAD BEEN MELODIOUS SEABREEZES
THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY FINE IN LYDGATES LOOK JUST THEN AND ANY ONEMIGHT HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED TO BET ON HIS ACHIEVEMENT
 IN HIS DARK EYESAND ON HIS MOUTH AND BROW THERE WAS THAT PLACIDITY WHICH COMES FROM THEFULNESS OF CONTEMPLATIVE THOUGHTTHE MIND NOT SEARCHING BUT BEHOLDINGAND THE GLANCE SEEMING TO BE FILLED WITH WHAT IS BEHIND IT
PRESENTLY ROSAMOND LEFT THE PIANO AND SEATED HERSELF ON A CHAIR CLOSETO THE SOFA AND OPPOSITE HER HUSBANDS FACE
IS THAT ENOUGH MUSIC FOR YOU MY LORD
 SHE SAID FOLDING HER HANDSBEFORE HER AND PUTTING ON A LITTLE AIR OF MEEKNESS
YES DEAR IF YOU ARE TIRED SAID LYDGATE GENTLY TURNING HIS EYESAND RESTING THEM ON HER BUT NOT OTHERWISE MOVING
 ROSAMONDS PRESENCEAT THAT MOMENT WAS PERHAPS NO MORE THAN A SPOONFUL BROUGHT TO THE LAKEAND HER WOMANS INSTINCT IN THIS MATTER WAS NOT DULL
WHAT IS ABSORBING YOU
 SHE SAID LEANING FORWARD AND BRINGING HERFACE NEARER TO HIS
HE MOVED HIS HANDS AND PLACED THEM GENTLY BEHIND HER SHOULDERS
I AM THINKING OF A GREAT FELLOW WHO WAS ABOUT AS OLD AS I AM THREEHUNDRED YEARS AGO AND HAD ALREADY BEGUN A NEW ERA IN ANATOMY
I CANT GUESS SAID ROSAMOND SHAKING HER HEAD
 WE USED TO PLAY ATGUESSING HISTORICAL CHARACTERS AT MRS
 LEMONS BUT NOT ANATOMISTS
ILL TELL YOU
 HIS NAME WAS VESALIUS
 AND THE ONLY WAY HE COULD GET TOKNOW ANATOMY AS HE DID WAS BY GOING TO SNATCH BODIES AT NIGHT FROMGRAVEYARDS AND PLACES OF EXECUTION
OH
 SAID ROSAMOND WITH A LOOK OF DISGUST ON HER PRETTY FACE I AMVERY GLAD YOU ARE NOT VESALIUS
 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE MIGHT FINDSOME LESS HORRIBLE WAY THAN THAT
NO HE COULDNT SAID LYDGATE GOING ON TOO EARNESTLY TO TAKE MUCHNOTICE OF HER ANSWER
 HE COULD ONLY GET A COMPLETE SKELETON BYSNATCHING THE WHITENED BONES OF A CRIMINAL FROM THE GALLOWS ANDBURYING THEM AND FETCHING THEM AWAY BY BITS SECRETLY IN THE DEAD OFNIGHT
I HOPE HE IS NOT ONE OF YOUR GREAT HEROES SAID ROSAMOND HALFPLAYFULLY HALF ANXIOUSLY ELSE I SHALL HAVE YOU GETTING UP IN THENIGHT TO GO TO ST
 PETERS CHURCHYARD
 YOU KNOW HOW ANGRY YOU TOLD METHE PEOPLE WERE ABOUT MRS
 GOBY
 YOU HAVE ENEMIES ENOUGH ALREADY
SO HAD VESALIUS ROSY
 NO WONDER THE MEDICAL FOGIES IN MIDDLEMARCH AREJEALOUS WHEN SOME OF THE GREATEST DOCTORS LIVING WERE FIERCE UPONVESALIUS BECAUSE THEY HAD BELIEVED IN GALEN AND HE SHOWED THAT GALENWAS WRONG
 THEY CALLED HIM A LIAR AND A POISONOUS MONSTER
 BUT THEFACTS OF THE HUMAN FRAME WERE ON HIS SIDE AND SO HE GOT THE BETTER OFTHEM
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AFTERWARDS
 SAID ROSAMOND WITH SOMEINTEREST
OH HE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF FIGHTING TO THE LAST
 AND THEY DIDEXASPERATE HIM ENOUGH AT ONE TIME TO MAKE HIM BURN A GOOD DEAL OF HISWORK
 THEN HE GOT SHIPWRECKED JUST AS HE WAS COMING FROM JERUSALEM TOTAKE A GREAT CHAIR AT PADUA
 HE DIED RATHER MISERABLY
THERE WAS A MOMENTS PAUSE BEFORE ROSAMOND SAID DO YOU KNOW TERTIUSI OFTEN WISH YOU HAD NOT BEEN A MEDICAL MAN
NAY ROSY DONT SAY THAT SAID LYDGATE DRAWING HER CLOSER TO HIM
THAT IS LIKE SAYING YOU WISH YOU HAD MARRIED ANOTHER MAN
NOT AT ALL YOU ARE CLEVER ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING YOU MIGHT EASILY HAVEBEEN SOMETHING ELSE
 AND YOUR COUSINS AT QUALLINGHAM ALL THINK THAT YOUHAVE SUNK BELOW THEM IN YOUR CHOICE OF A PROFESSION
THE COUSINS AT QUALLINGHAM MAY GO TO THE DEVIL
 SAID LYDGATE WITHSCORN
 IT WAS LIKE THEIR IMPUDENCE IF THEY SAID ANYTHING OF THE SORTTO YOU
STILL SAID ROSAMOND I DO NOT THINK IT IS A NICE PROFESSIONDEAR
 WE KNOW THAT SHE HAD MUCH QUIET PERSEVERANCE IN HER OPINION
IT IS THE GRANDEST PROFESSION IN THE WORLD ROSAMOND SAID LYDGATEGRAVELY
 AND TO SAY THAT YOU LOVE ME WITHOUT LOVING THE MEDICAL MAN INME IS THE SAME SORT OF THING AS TO SAY THAT YOU LIKE EATING A PEACHBUT DONT LIKE ITS FLAVOR
 DONT SAY THAT AGAIN DEAR IT PAINS ME
VERY WELL DOCTOR GRAVEFACE SAID ROSY DIMPLING I WILL DECLARE INFUTURE THAT I DOTE ON SKELETONS AND BODYSNATCHERS AND BITS OF THINGSIN PHIALS AND QUARRELS WITH EVERYBODY THAT END IN YOUR DYINGMISERABLY
NO NO NOT SO BAD AS THAT SAID LYDGATE GIVING UP REMONSTRANCE ANDPETTING HER RESIGNEDLY
CHAPTER XLVI
PUES NO PODEMOS HABER AQUELLO QUE QUEREMOS QUERAMOS AQUELLO QUEPODREMOS
SINCE WE CANNOT GET WHAT WE LIKE LET US LIKE WHAT WE CAN GET
SPANISHPROVERB
WHILE LYDGATE SAFELY MARRIED AND WITH THE HOSPITAL UNDER HIS COMMANDFELT HIMSELF STRUGGLING FOR MEDICAL REFORM AGAINST MIDDLEMARCHMIDDLEMARCH WAS BECOMING MORE AND MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE NATIONALSTRUGGLE FOR ANOTHER KIND OF REFORM
BY THE TIME THAT LORD JOHN RUSSELLS MEASURE WAS BEING DEBATED IN THEHOUSE OF COMMONS THERE WAS A NEW POLITICAL ANIMATION IN MIDDLEMARCHAND A NEW DEFINITION OF PARTIES WHICH MIGHT SHOW A DECIDED CHANGE OFBALANCE IF A NEW ELECTION CAME
 AND THERE WERE SOME WHO ALREADYPREDICTED THIS EVENT DECLARING THAT A REFORM BILL WOULD NEVER BECARRIED BY THE ACTUAL PARLIAMENT
 THIS WAS WHAT WILL LADISLAW DWELT ONTO MR
 BROOKE AS A REASON FOR CONGRATULATION THAT HE HAD NOT YET TRIEDHIS STRENGTH AT THE HUSTINGS
THINGS WILL GROW AND RIPEN AS IF IT WERE A COMET YEAR SAID WILL
THE PUBLIC TEMPER WILL SOON GET TO A COMETARY HEAT NOW THE QUESTIONOF REFORM HAS SET IN
 THERE IS LIKELY TO BE ANOTHER ELECTION BEFORELONG AND BY THAT TIME MIDDLEMARCH WILL HAVE GOT MORE IDEAS INTO ITSHEAD
 WHAT WE HAVE TO WORK AT NOW IS THE PIONEER AND POLITICALMEETINGS
QUITE RIGHT LADISLAW WE SHALL MAKE A NEW THING OF OPINION HERESAID MR
 BROOKE
 ONLY I WANT TO KEEP MYSELF INDEPENDENT ABOUT REFORMYOU KNOW I DONT WANT TO GO TOO FAR
 I WANT TO TAKE UP WILBERFORCESAND ROMILLYS LINE YOU KNOW AND WORK AT NEGRO EMANCIPATION CRIMINALLAWTHAT KIND OF THING
 BUT OF COURSE I SHOULD SUPPORT GREY
IF YOU GO IN FOR THE PRINCIPLE OF REFORM YOU MUST BE PREPARED TO TAKEWHAT THE SITUATION OFFERS SAID WILL
 IF EVERYBODY PULLED FOR HIS OWNBIT AGAINST EVERYBODY ELSE THE WHOLE QUESTION WOULD GO TO TATTERS
YES YES I AGREE WITH YOUI QUITE TAKE THAT POINT OF VIEW
 I SHOULDPUT IT IN THAT LIGHT
 I SHOULD SUPPORT GREY YOU KNOW
 BUT I DONT WANTTO CHANGE THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION AND I DONT THINK GREYWOULD
BUT THAT IS WHAT THE COUNTRY WANTS SAID WILL
 ELSE THERE WOULD BENO MEANING IN POLITICAL UNIONS OR ANY OTHER MOVEMENT THAT KNOWS WHATITS ABOUT
 IT WANTS TO HAVE A HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH IS NOT WEIGHTEDWITH NOMINEES OF THE LANDED CLASS BUT WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THEOTHER INTERESTS
 AND AS TO CONTENDING FOR A REFORM SHORT OF THAT IT ISLIKE ASKING FOR A BIT OF AN AVALANCHE WHICH HAS ALREADY BEGUN TOTHUNDER
THAT IS FINE LADISLAW THAT IS THE WAY TO PUT IT
 WRITE THAT DOWNNOW
 WE MUST BEGIN TO GET DOCUMENTS ABOUT THE FEELING OF THE COUNTRYAS WELL AS THE MACHINEBREAKING AND GENERAL DISTRESS
AS TO DOCUMENTS SAID WILL A TWOINCH CARD WILL HOLD PLENTY
 A FEWROWS OF FIGURES ARE ENOUGH TO DEDUCE MISERY FROM AND A FEW MORE WILLSHOW THE RATE AT WHICH THE POLITICAL DETERMINATION OF THE PEOPLE ISGROWING
GOOD DRAW THAT OUT A LITTLE MORE AT LENGTH LADISLAW
 THAT IS ANIDEA NOW WRITE IT OUT IN THE PIONEER
 PUT THE FIGURES AND DEDUCETHE MISERY YOU KNOW AND PUT THE OTHER FIGURES AND DEDUCEAND SO ON
YOU HAVE A WAY OF PUTTING THINGS
 BURKE NOWWHEN I THINK OF BURKE ICANT HELP WISHING SOMEBODY HAD A POCKETBOROUGH TO GIVE YOU LADISLAW
YOUD NEVER GET ELECTED YOU KNOW
 AND WE SHALL ALWAYS WANT TALENT INTHE HOUSE REFORM AS WE WILL WE SHALL ALWAYS WANT TALENT
 THATAVALANCHE AND THE THUNDER NOW WAS REALLY A LITTLE LIKE BURKE
 I WANTTHAT SORT OF THINGNOT IDEAS YOU KNOW BUT A WAY OF PUTTING THEM
POCKETBOROUGHS WOULD BE A FINE THING SAID LADISLAW IF THEY WEREALWAYS IN THE RIGHT POCKET AND THERE WERE ALWAYS A BURKE AT HAND
WILL WAS NOT DISPLEASED WITH THAT COMPLIMENTARY COMPARISON EVEN FROMMR
 BROOKE FOR IT IS A LITTLE TOO TRYING TO HUMAN FLESH TO BECONSCIOUS OF EXPRESSING ONES SELF BETTER THAN OTHERS AND NEVER TO HAVEIT NOTICED AND IN THE GENERAL DEARTH OF ADMIRATION FOR THE RIGHTTHING EVEN A CHANCE BRAY OF APPLAUSE FALLING EXACTLY IN TIME IS RATHERFORTIFYING
 WILL FELT THAT HIS LITERARY REFINEMENTS WERE USUALLY BEYONDTHE LIMITS OF MIDDLEMARCH PERCEPTION NEVERTHELESS HE WAS BEGINNINGTHOROUGHLY TO LIKE THE WORK OF WHICH WHEN HE BEGAN HE HAD SAID TOHIMSELF RATHER LANGUIDLY WHY NOT
AND HE STUDIED THE POLITICALSITUATION WITH AS ARDENT AN INTEREST AS HE HAD EVER GIVEN TO POETICMETRES OR MEDIAEVALISM
 IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT BUT FOR THE DESIRE TO BEWHERE DOROTHEA WAS AND PERHAPS THE WANT OF KNOWING WHAT ELSE TO DOWILL WOULD NOT AT THIS TIME HAVE BEEN MEDITATING ON THE NEEDS OF THEENGLISH PEOPLE OR CRITICISING ENGLISH STATESMANSHIP HE WOULD PROBABLYHAVE BEEN RAMBLING IN ITALY SKETCHING PLANS FOR SEVERAL DRAMAS TRYINGPROSE AND FINDING IT TOO JEJUNE TRYING VERSE AND FINDING IT TOOARTIFICIAL BEGINNING TO COPY BITS FROM OLD PICTURES LEAVING OFFBECAUSE THEY WERE NO GOOD AND OBSERVING THAT AFTER ALLSELFCULTURE WAS THE PRINCIPAL POINT WHILE IN POLITICS HE WOULD HAVEBEEN SYMPATHIZING WARMLY WITH LIBERTY AND PROGRESS IN GENERAL
 OURSENSE OF DUTY MUST OFTEN WAIT FOR SOME WORK WHICH SHALL TAKE THE PLACEOF DILETTANTEISM AND MAKE US FEEL THAT THE QUALITY OF OUR ACTION IS NOTA MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE
LADISLAW HAD NOW ACCEPTED HIS BIT OF WORK THOUGH IT WAS NOT THATINDETERMINATE LOFTIEST THING WHICH HE HAD ONCE DREAMED OF AS ALONEWORTHY OF CONTINUOUS EFFORT
 HIS NATURE WARMED EASILY IN THE PRESENCEOF SUBJECTS WHICH WERE VISIBLY MIXED WITH LIFE AND ACTION AND THEEASILY STIRRED REBELLION IN HIM HELPED THE GLOW OF PUBLIC SPIRIT
 INSPITE OF MR
 CASAUBON AND THE BANISHMENT FROM LOWICK HE WAS RATHERHAPPY GETTING A GREAT DEAL OF FRESH KNOWLEDGE IN A VIVID WAY AND FORPRACTICAL PURPOSES AND MAKING THE PIONEER CELEBRATED AS FAR ASBRASSING NEVER MIND THE SMALLNESS OF THE AREA THE WRITING WAS NOTWORSE THAN MUCH THAT REACHES THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH
MR
 BROOKE WAS OCCASIONALLY IRRITATING BUT WILLS IMPATIENCE WASRELIEVED BY THE DIVISION OF HIS TIME BETWEEN VISITS TO THE GRANGE ANDRETREATS TO HIS MIDDLEMARCH LODGINGS WHICH GAVE VARIETY TO HIS LIFE
SHIFT THE PEGS A LITTLE HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND MR
 BROOKE MIGHT BEIN THE CABINET WHILE I WAS UNDERSECRETARY
 THAT IS THE COMMON ORDEROF THINGS THE LITTLE WAVES MAKE THE LARGE ONES AND ARE OF THE SAMEPATTERN
 I AM BETTER HERE THAN IN THE SORT OF LIFE MR
 CASAUBON WOULDHAVE TRAINED ME FOR WHERE THE DOING WOULD BE ALL LAID DOWN BY APRECEDENT TOO RIGID FOR ME TO REACT UPON
 I DONT CARE FOR PRESTIGE ORHIGH PAY
AS LYDGATE HAD SAID OF HIM HE WAS A SORT OF GYPSY RATHER ENJOYING THESENSE OF BELONGING TO NO CLASS HE HAD A FEELING OF ROMANCE IN HISPOSITION AND A PLEASANT CONSCIOUSNESS OF CREATING A LITTLE SURPRISEWHEREVER HE WENT
 THAT SORT OF ENJOYMENT HAD BEEN DISTURBED WHEN HE HADFELT SOME NEW DISTANCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND DOROTHEA IN THEIR ACCIDENTALMEETING AT LYDGATES AND HIS IRRITATION HAD GONE OUT TOWARDS MR
CASAUBON WHO HAD DECLARED BEFOREHAND THAT WILL WOULD LOSE CASTE
 INEVER HAD ANY CASTE HE WOULD HAVE SAID IF THAT PROPHECY HAD BEENUTTERED TO HIM AND THE QUICK BLOOD WOULD HAVE COME AND GONE LIKEBREATH IN HIS TRANSPARENT SKIN
 BUT IT IS ONE THING TO LIKE DEFIANCEAND ANOTHER THING TO LIKE ITS CONSEQUENCES
MEANWHILE THE TOWN OPINION ABOUT THE NEW EDITOR OF THE PIONEER WASTENDING TO CONFIRM MR
 CASAUBONS VIEW
 WILLS RELATIONSHIP IN THATDISTINGUISHED QUARTER DID NOT LIKE LYDGATES HIGH CONNECTIONS SERVEAS AN ADVANTAGEOUS INTRODUCTION IF IT WAS RUMORED THAT YOUNG LADISLAWWAS MR
 CASAUBONS NEPHEW OR COUSIN IT WAS ALSO RUMORED THAT MR
CASAUBON WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM
BROOKE HAS TAKEN HIM UP SAID MR
 HAWLEY BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT NOMAN IN HIS SENSES COULD HAVE EXPECTED
 CASAUBON HAS DEVILISH GOODREASONS YOU MAY BE SURE FOR TURNING THE COLD SHOULDER ON A YOUNGFELLOW WHOSE BRINGINGUP HE PAID FOR
 JUST LIKE BROOKEONE OF THOSEFELLOWS WHO WOULD PRAISE A CAT TO SELL A HORSE
AND SOME ODDITIES OF WILLS MORE OR LESS POETICAL APPEARED TO SUPPORTMR
 KECK THE EDITOR OF THE TRUMPET IN ASSERTING THAT LADISLAW IFTHE TRUTH WERE KNOWN WAS NOT ONLY A POLISH EMISSARY BUT CRACKBRAINEDWHICH ACCOUNTED FOR THE PRETERNATURAL QUICKNESS AND GLIBNESS OF HISSPEECH WHEN HE GOT ON TO A PLATFORMAS HE DID WHENEVER HE HAD ANOPPORTUNITY SPEAKING WITH A FACILITY WHICH CAST REFLECTIONS ON SOLIDENGLISHMEN GENERALLY
 IT WAS DISGUSTING TO KECK TO SEE A STRIP OF AFELLOW WITH LIGHT CURLS ROUND HIS HEAD GET UP AND SPEECHIFY BY THEHOUR AGAINST INSTITUTIONS WHICH HAD EXISTED WHEN HE WAS IN HISCRADLE
 AND IN A LEADING ARTICLE OF THE TRUMPET KECK CHARACTERIZEDLADISLAWS SPEECH AT A REFORM MEETING AS THE VIOLENCE OF ANENERGUMENA MISERABLE EFFORT TO SHROUD IN THE BRILLIANCY OF FIREWORKSTHE DARING OF IRRESPONSIBLE STATEMENTS AND THE POVERTY OF A KNOWLEDGEWHICH WAS OF THE CHEAPEST AND MOST RECENT DESCRIPTION
THAT WAS A RATTLING ARTICLE YESTERDAY KECK SAID DR
 SPRAGUE WITHSARCASTIC INTENTIONS
 BUT WHAT IS AN ENERGUMEN
OH A TERM THAT CAME UP IN THE FRENCH REVOLUTION SAID KECK
THIS DANGEROUS ASPECT OF LADISLAW WAS STRANGELY CONTRASTED WITH OTHERHABITS WHICH BECAME MATTER OF REMARK
 HE HAD A FONDNESS HALF ARTISTICHALF AFFECTIONATE FOR LITTLE CHILDRENTHE SMALLER THEY WERE ONTOLERABLY ACTIVE LEGS AND THE FUNNIER THEIR CLOTHING THE BETTER WILLLIKED TO SURPRISE AND PLEASE THEM
 WE KNOW THAT IN ROME HE WAS GIVEN TORAMBLE ABOUT AMONG THE POOR PEOPLE AND THE TASTE DID NOT QUIT HIM INMIDDLEMARCH
HE HAD SOMEHOW PICKED UP A TROOP OF DROLL CHILDREN LITTLE HATLESS BOYSWITH THEIR GALLIGASKINS MUCH WORN AND SCANT SHIRTING TO HANG OUTLITTLE GIRLS WHO TOSSED THEIR HAIR OUT OF THEIR EYES TO LOOK AT HIMAND GUARDIAN BROTHERS AT THE MATURE AGE OF SEVEN
 THIS TROOP HE HAD LEDOUT ON GYPSY EXCURSIONS TO HALSELL WOOD AT NUTTINGTIME AND SINCE THECOLD WEATHER HAD SET IN HE HAD TAKEN THEM ON A CLEAR DAY TO GATHERSTICKS FOR A BONFIRE IN THE HOLLOW OF A HILLSIDE WHERE HE DREW OUT ASMALL FEAST OF GINGERBREAD FOR THEM AND IMPROVISED A PUNCHANDJUDYDRAMA WITH SOME PRIVATE HOMEMADE PUPPETS
 HERE WAS ONE ODDITY
 ANOTHERWAS THAT IN HOUSES WHERE HE GOT FRIENDLY HE WAS GIVEN TO STRETCHHIMSELF AT FULL LENGTH ON THE RUG WHILE HE TALKED AND WAS APT TO BEDISCOVERED IN THIS ATTITUDE BY OCCASIONAL CALLERS FOR WHOM SUCH ANIRREGULARITY WAS LIKELY TO CONFIRM THE NOTIONS OF HIS DANGEROUSLY MIXEDBLOOD AND GENERAL LAXITY
BUT WILLS ARTICLES AND SPEECHES NATURALLY RECOMMENDED HIM IN FAMILIESWHICH THE NEW STRICTNESS OF PARTY DIVISION HAD MARKED OFF ON THE SIDEOF REFORM
 HE WAS INVITED TO MR
 BULSTRODES BUT HERE HE COULD NOT LIEDOWN ON THE RUG AND MRS
 BULSTRODE FELT THAT HIS MODE OF TALKING ABOUTCATHOLIC COUNTRIES AS IF THERE WERE ANY TRUCE WITH ANTICHRISTILLUSTRATED THE USUAL TENDENCY TO UNSOUNDNESS IN INTELLECTUAL MEN
AT MR
 FAREBROTHERS HOWEVER WHOM THE IRONY OF EVENTS HAD BROUGHT ONTHE SAME SIDE WITH BULSTRODE IN THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT WILL BECAME AFAVORITE WITH THE LADIES ESPECIALLY WITH LITTLE MISS NOBLE WHOM ITWAS ONE OF HIS ODDITIES TO ESCORT WHEN HE MET HER IN THE STREET WITHHER LITTLE BASKET GIVING HER HIS ARM IN THE EYES OF THE TOWN ANDINSISTING ON GOING WITH HER TO PAY SOME CALL WHERE SHE DISTRIBUTED HERSMALL FILCHINGS FROM HER OWN SHARE OF SWEET THINGS
BUT THE HOUSE WHERE HE VISITED OFTENEST AND LAY MOST ON THE RUG WASLYDGATES
 THE TWO MEN WERE NOT AT ALL ALIKE BUT THEY AGREED NONE THEWORSE
 LYDGATE WAS ABRUPT BUT NOT IRRITABLE TAKING LITTLE NOTICE OFMEGRIMS IN HEALTHY PEOPLE AND LADISLAW DID NOT USUALLY THROW AWAY HISSUSCEPTIBILITIES ON THOSE WHO TOOK NO NOTICE OF THEM
 WITH ROSAMOND ONTHE OTHER HAND HE POUTED AND WAS WAYWARDNAY OFTEN UNCOMPLIMENTARYMUCH TO HER INWARD SURPRISE NEVERTHELESS HE WAS GRADUALLY BECOMINGNECESSARY TO HER ENTERTAINMENT BY HIS COMPANIONSHIP IN HER MUSIC HISVARIED TALK AND HIS FREEDOM FROM THE GRAVE PREOCCUPATION WHICH WITHALL HER HUSBANDS TENDERNESS AND INDULGENCE OFTEN MADE HIS MANNERSUNSATISFACTORY TO HER AND CONFIRMED HER DISLIKE OF THE MEDICALPROFESSION
LYDGATE INCLINED TO BE SARCASTIC ON THE SUPERSTITIOUS FAITH OF THEPEOPLE IN THE EFFICACY OF THE BILL WHILE NOBODY CARED ABOUT THE LOWSTATE OF PATHOLOGY SOMETIMES ASSAILED WILL WITH TROUBLESOME QUESTIONS
ONE EVENING IN MARCH ROSAMOND IN HER CHERRYCOLORED DRESS WITHSWANSDOWN TRIMMING ABOUT THE THROAT SAT AT THE TEATABLE LYDGATELATELY COME IN TIRED FROM HIS OUTDOOR WORK WAS SEATED SIDEWAYS ON ANEASYCHAIR BY THE FIRE WITH ONE LEG OVER THE ELBOW HIS BROW LOOKING ALITTLE TROUBLED AS HIS EYES RAMBLED OVER THE COLUMNS OF THE PIONEERWHILE ROSAMOND HAVING NOTICED THAT HE WAS PERTURBED AVOIDED LOOKINGAT HIM AND INWARDLY THANKED HEAVEN THAT SHE HERSELF HAD NOT A MOODYDISPOSITION
 WILL LADISLAW WAS STRETCHED ON THE RUG CONTEMPLATING THECURTAINPOLE ABSTRACTEDLY AND HUMMING VERY LOW THE NOTES OF WHENFIRST I SAW THY FACE WHILE THE HOUSE SPANIEL ALSO STRETCHED OUT WITHSMALL CHOICE OF ROOM LOOKED FROM BETWEEN HIS PAWS AT THE USURPER OFTHE RUG WITH SILENT BUT STRONG OBJECTION
ROSAMOND BRINGING LYDGATE HIS CUP OF TEA HE THREW DOWN THE PAPER ANDSAID TO WILL WHO HAD STARTED UP AND GONE TO THE TABLEITS NO USE YOUR PUFFING BROOKE AS A REFORMING LANDLORD LADISLAWTHEY ONLY PICK THE MORE HOLES IN HIS COAT IN THE TRUMPET
NO MATTER THOSE WHO READ THE PIONEER DONT READ THE TRUMPETSAID WILL SWALLOWING HIS TEA AND WALKING ABOUT
 DO YOU SUPPOSE THEPUBLIC READS WITH A VIEW TO ITS OWN CONVERSION
 WE SHOULD HAVE AWITCHES BREWING WITH A VENGEANCE THENMINGLE MINGLE MINGLE MINGLEYOU THAT MINGLE MAYAND NOBODY WOULD KNOW WHICH SIDE HE WAS GOING TOTAKE
FAREBROTHER SAYS HE DOESNT BELIEVE BROOKE WOULD GET ELECTED IF THEOPPORTUNITY CAME THE VERY MEN WHO PROFESS TO BE FOR HIM WOULD BRINGANOTHER MEMBER OUT OF THE BAG AT THE RIGHT MOMENT
THERES NO HARM IN TRYING
 ITS GOOD TO HAVE RESIDENT MEMBERS
WHY
 SAID LYDGATE WHO WAS MUCH GIVEN TO USE THAT INCONVENIENT WORDIN A CURT TONE
THEY REPRESENT THE LOCAL STUPIDITY BETTER SAID WILL LAUGHING ANDSHAKING HIS CURLS AND THEY ARE KEPT ON THEIR BEST BEHAVIOR IN THENEIGHBORHOOD
 BROOKE IS NOT A BAD FELLOW BUT HE HAS DONE SOME GOODTHINGS ON HIS ESTATE THAT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE BUT FOR THISPARLIAMENTARY BITE
HES NOT FITTED TO BE A PUBLIC MAN SAID LYDGATE WITH CONTEMPTUOUSDECISION
 HE WOULD DISAPPOINT EVERYBODY WHO COUNTED ON HIM I CAN SEETHAT AT THE HOSPITAL
 ONLY THERE BULSTRODE HOLDS THE REINS AND DRIVESHIM
THAT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU FIX YOUR STANDARD OF PUBLIC MEN SAID WILL
HES GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE OCCASION WHEN THE PEOPLE HAVE MADE UP THEIRMIND AS THEY ARE MAKING IT UP NOW THEY DONT WANT A MANTHEY ONLY WANTA VOTE
THAT IS THE WAY WITH YOU POLITICAL WRITERS LADISLAWCRYING UP AMEASURE AS IF IT WERE A UNIVERSAL CURE AND CRYING UP MEN WHO ARE APART OF THE VERY DISEASE THAT WANTS CURING
WHY NOT
 MEN MAY HELP TO CURE THEMSELVES OFF THE FACE OF THE LANDWITHOUT KNOWING IT SAID WILL WHO COULD FIND REASONS IMPROMPTU WHENHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF A QUESTION BEFOREHAND
THAT IS NO EXCUSE FOR ENCOURAGING THE SUPERSTITIOUS EXAGGERATION OFHOPES ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE HELPING THE CRY TO SWALLOW ITWHOLE AND TO SEND UP VOTING POPINJAYS WHO ARE GOOD FOR NOTHING BUT TOCARRY IT
 YOU GO AGAINST ROTTENNESS AND THERE IS NOTHING MORETHOROUGHLY ROTTEN THAN MAKING PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT SOCIETY CAN BE CUREDBY A POLITICAL HOCUSPOCUS
THATS VERY FINE MY DEAR FELLOW
 BUT YOUR CURE MUST BEGIN SOMEWHEREAND PUT IT THAT A THOUSAND THINGS WHICH DEBASE A POPULATION CAN NEVERBE REFORMED WITHOUT THIS PARTICULAR REFORM TO BEGIN WITH
 LOOK WHATSTANLEY SAID THE OTHER DAYTHAT THE HOUSE HAD BEEN TINKERING LONGENOUGH AT SMALL QUESTIONS OF BRIBERY INQUIRING WHETHER THIS OR THATVOTER HAS HAD A GUINEA WHEN EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THE SEATS HAVE BEENSOLD WHOLESALE
 WAIT FOR WISDOM AND CONSCIENCE IN PUBLICAGENTSFIDDLESTICK
 THE ONLY CONSCIENCE WE CAN TRUST TO IS THE MASSIVESENSE OF WRONG IN A CLASS AND THE BEST WISDOM THAT WILL WORK IS THEWISDOM OF BALANCING CLAIMS
 THATS MY TEXTWHICH SIDE IS INJURED
 ISUPPORT THE MAN WHO SUPPORTS THEIR CLAIMS NOT THE VIRTUOUS UPHOLDER OFTHE WRONG
THAT GENERAL TALK ABOUT A PARTICULAR CASE IS MERE QUESTION BEGGINGLADISLAW
 WHEN I SAY I GO IN FOR THE DOSE THAT CURES IT DOESNTFOLLOW THAT I GO IN FOR OPIUM IN A GIVEN CASE OF GOUT
I AM NOT BEGGING THE QUESTION WE ARE UPONWHETHER WE ARE TO TRY FORNOTHING TILL WE FIND IMMACULATE MEN TO WORK WITH
 SHOULD YOU GO ON THATPLAN
 IF THERE WERE ONE MAN WHO WOULD CARRY YOU A MEDICAL REFORM ANDANOTHER WHO WOULD OPPOSE IT SHOULD YOU INQUIRE WHICH HAD THE BETTERMOTIVES OR EVEN THE BETTER BRAINS
OH OF COURSE SAID LYDGATE SEEING HIMSELF CHECKMATED BY A MOVEWHICH HE HAD OFTEN USED HIMSELF IF ONE DID NOT WORK WITH SUCH MEN ASARE AT HAND THINGS MUST COME TO A DEADLOCK
 SUPPOSE THE WORST OPINIONIN THE TOWN ABOUT BULSTRODE WERE A TRUE ONE THAT WOULD NOT MAKE ITLESS TRUE THAT HE HAS THE SENSE AND THE RESOLUTION TO DO WHAT I THINKOUGHT TO BE DONE IN THE MATTERS I KNOW AND CARE MOST ABOUT BUT THAT ISTHE ONLY GROUND ON WHICH I GO WITH HIM LYDGATE ADDED RATHER PROUDLYBEARING IN MIND MR
 FAREBROTHERS REMARKS
 HE IS NOTHING TO MEOTHERWISE I WOULD NOT CRY HIM UP ON ANY PERSONAL GROUNDI WOULD KEEPCLEAR OF THAT
DO YOU MEAN THAT I CRY UP BROOKE ON ANY PERSONAL GROUND
 SAID WILLLADISLAW NETTLED AND TURNING SHARP ROUND
 FOR THE FIRST TIME HE FELTOFFENDED WITH LYDGATE NOT THE LESS SO PERHAPS BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVEDECLINED ANY CLOSE INQUIRY INTO THE GROWTH OF HIS RELATION TO MR
BROOKE
NOT AT ALL SAID LYDGATE I WAS SIMPLY EXPLAINING MY OWN ACTION
 IMEANT THAT A MAN MAY WORK FOR A SPECIAL END WITH OTHERS WHOSE MOTIVESAND GENERAL COURSE ARE EQUIVOCAL IF HE IS QUITE SURE OF HIS PERSONALINDEPENDENCE AND THAT HE IS NOT WORKING FOR HIS PRIVATEINTERESTEITHER PLACE OR MONEY
THEN WHY DONT YOU EXTEND YOUR LIBERALITY TO OTHERS
 SAID WILLSTILL NETTLED
 MY PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE IS AS IMPORTANT TO ME AS YOURSIS TO YOU
 YOU HAVE NO MORE REASON TO IMAGINE THAT I HAVE PERSONALEXPECTATIONS FROM BROOKE THAN I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE PERSONALEXPECTATIONS FROM BULSTRODE
 MOTIVES ARE POINTS OF HONOR ISUPPOSENOBODY CAN PROVE THEM
 BUT AS TO MONEY AND PLACE IN THE WORLDWILL ENDED TOSSING BACK HIS HEAD I THINK IT IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT IAM NOT DETERMINED BY CONSIDERATIONS OF THAT SORT
YOU QUITE MISTAKE ME LADISLAW SAID LYDGATE SURPRISED
 HE HAD BEENPREOCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN VINDICATION AND HAD BEEN BLIND TO WHATLADISLAW MIGHT INFER ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT
 I BEG YOUR PARDON FORUNINTENTIONALLY ANNOYING YOU
 IN FACT I SHOULD RATHER ATTRIBUTE TO YOUA ROMANTIC DISREGARD OF YOUR OWN WORLDLY INTERESTS
 ON THE POLITICALQUESTION I REFERRED SIMPLY TO INTELLECTUAL BIAS
HOW VERY UNPLEASANT YOU BOTH ARE THIS EVENING
 SAID ROSAMOND
 ICANNOT CONCEIVE WHY MONEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO
 POLITICS ANDMEDICINE ARE SUFFICIENTLY DISAGREEABLE TO QUARREL UPON
 YOU CAN BOTH OFYOU GO ON QUARRELLING WITH ALL THE WORLD AND WITH EACH OTHER ON THOSETWO TOPICS
ROSAMOND LOOKED MILDLY NEUTRAL AS SHE SAID THIS RISING TO RING THEBELL AND THEN CROSSING TO HER WORKTABLE
POOR ROSY
 SAID LYDGATE PUTTING OUT HIS HAND TO HER AS SHE WASPASSING HIM
 DISPUTATION IS NOT AMUSING TO CHERUBS
 HAVE SOME MUSIC
ASK LADISLAW TO SING WITH YOU
WHEN WILL WAS GONE ROSAMOND SAID TO HER HUSBAND WHAT PUT YOU OUT OFTEMPER THIS EVENING TERTIUS
ME
 IT WAS LADISLAW WHO WAS OUT OF TEMPER
 HE IS LIKE A BIT OFTINDER
BUT I MEAN BEFORE THAT
 SOMETHING HAD VEXED YOU BEFORE YOU CAME INYOU LOOKED CROSS
 AND THAT MADE YOU BEGIN TO DISPUTE WITH MR
 LADISLAW
YOU HURT ME VERY MUCH WHEN YOU LOOK SO TERTIUS
DO I
 THEN I AM A BRUTE SAID LYDGATE CARESSING HER PENITENTLY
WHAT VEXED YOU
OH OUTDOOR THINGSBUSINESS
 IT WAS REALLY A LETTER INSISTING ON THEPAYMENT OF A BILL FOR FURNITURE
 BUT ROSAMOND WAS EXPECTING TO HAVE ABABY AND LYDGATE WISHED TO SAVE HER FROM ANY PERTURBATION
CHAPTER XLVII
WAS NEVER TRUE LOVE LOVED IN VAINFOR TRUEST LOVE IS HIGHEST GAIN
NO ART CAN MAKE IT IT MUST SPRINGWHERE ELEMENTS ARE FOSTERING
SO IN HEAVENS SPOT AND HOURSPRINGS THE LITTLE NATIVE FLOWERDOWNWARD ROOT AND UPWARD EYESHAPEN BY THE EARTH AND SKY
IT HAPPENED TO BE ON A SATURDAY EVENING THAT WILL LADISLAW HAD THATLITTLE DISCUSSION WITH LYDGATE
 ITS EFFECT WHEN HE WENT TO HIS OWNROOMS WAS TO MAKE HIM SIT UP HALF THE NIGHT THINKING OVER AGAIN UNDERA NEW IRRITATION ALL THAT HE HAD BEFORE THOUGHT OF HIS HAVING SETTLEDIN MIDDLEMARCH AND HARNESSED HIMSELF WITH MR
 BROOKE
 HESITATIONSBEFORE HE HAD TAKEN THE STEP HAD SINCE TURNED INTO SUSCEPTIBILITY TOEVERY HINT THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WISER NOT TO TAKE IT AND HENCE CAMEHIS HEAT TOWARDS LYDGATEA HEAT WHICH STILL KEPT HIM RESTLESS
 WAS HENOT MAKING A FOOL OF HIMSELF
AND AT A TIME WHEN HE WAS MORE THAN EVERCONSCIOUS OF BEING SOMETHING BETTER THAN A FOOL
 AND FOR WHAT END
WELL FOR NO DEFINITE END
 TRUE HE HAD DREAMY VISIONS OFPOSSIBILITIES THERE IS NO HUMAN BEING WHO HAVING BOTH PASSIONS ANDTHOUGHTS DOES NOT THINK IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS PASSIONSDOES NOT FINDIMAGES RISING IN HIS MIND WHICH SOOTHE THE PASSION WITH HOPE OR STINGIT WITH DREAD
 BUT THIS WHICH HAPPENS TO US ALL HAPPENS TO SOME WITHA WIDE DIFFERENCE AND WILL WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE WHOSE WIT KEEPS THEROADWAY HE HAD HIS BYPATHS WHERE THERE WERE LITTLE JOYS OF HIS OWNCHOOSING SUCH AS GENTLEMEN CANTERING ON THE HIGHROAD MIGHT HAVETHOUGHT RATHER IDIOTIC
 THE WAY IN WHICH HE MADE A SORT OF HAPPINESSFOR HIMSELF OUT OF HIS FEELING FOR DOROTHEA WAS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS
 ITMAY SEEM STRANGE BUT IT IS THE FACT THAT THE ORDINARY VULGAR VISIONOF WHICH MR
 CASAUBON SUSPECTED HIMNAMELY THAT DOROTHEA MIGHT BECOMEA WIDOW AND THAT THE INTEREST HE HAD ESTABLISHED IN HER MIND MIGHTTURN INTO ACCEPTANCE OF HIM AS A HUSBANDHAD NO TEMPTING ARRESTINGPOWER OVER HIM HE DID NOT LIVE IN THE SCENERY OF SUCH AN EVENT ANDFOLLOW IT OUT AS WE ALL DO WITH THAT IMAGINED OTHERWISE WHICH IS OURPRACTICAL HEAVEN
 IT WAS NOT ONLY THAT HE WAS UNWILLING TO ENTERTAINTHOUGHTS WHICH COULD BE ACCUSED OF BASENESS AND WAS ALREADY UNEASY INTHE SENSE THAT HE HAD TO JUSTIFY HIMSELF FROM THE CHARGE OFINGRATITUDETHE LATENT CONSCIOUSNESS OF MANY OTHER BARRIERS BETWEENHIMSELF AND DOROTHEA BESIDES THE EXISTENCE OF HER HUSBAND HAD HELPEDTO TURN AWAY HIS IMAGINATION FROM SPECULATING ON WHAT MIGHT BEFALL MR
CASAUBON
 AND THERE WERE YET OTHER REASONS
 WILL WE KNOW COULD NOTBEAR THE THOUGHT OF ANY FLAW APPEARING IN HIS CRYSTAL HE WAS AT ONCEEXASPERATED AND DELIGHTED BY THE CALM FREEDOM WITH WHICH DOROTHEALOOKED AT HIM AND SPOKE TO HIM AND THERE WAS SOMETHING SO EXQUISITE INTHINKING OF HER JUST AS SHE WAS THAT HE COULD NOT LONG FOR A CHANGEWHICH MUST SOMEHOW CHANGE HER
 DO WE NOT SHUN THE STREET VERSION OF AFINE MELODY
OR SHRINK FROM THE NEWS THAT THE RARITYSOME BIT OFCHISELLING OR ENGRAVING PERHAPSWHICH WE HAVE DWELT ON EVEN WITHEXULTATION IN THE TROUBLE IT HAS COST US TO SNATCH GLIMPSES OF IT ISREALLY NOT AN UNCOMMON THING AND MAY BE OBTAINED AS AN EVERYDAYPOSSESSION
 OUR GOOD DEPENDS ON THE QUALITY AND BREADTH OF OUR EMOTIONAND TO WILL A CREATURE WHO CARED LITTLE FOR WHAT ARE CALLED THE SOLIDTHINGS OF LIFE AND GREATLY FOR ITS SUBTLER INFLUENCES TO HAVE WITHINHIM SUCH A FEELING AS HE HAD TOWARDS DOROTHEA WAS LIKE THE INHERITANCEOF A FORTUNE
 WHAT OTHERS MIGHT HAVE CALLED THE FUTILITY OF HISPASSION MADE AN ADDITIONAL DELIGHT FOR HIS IMAGINATION HE WASCONSCIOUS OF A GENEROUS MOVEMENT AND OF VERIFYING IN HIS OWNEXPERIENCE THAT HIGHER LOVEPOETRY WHICH HAD CHARMED HIS FANCY
DOROTHEA HE SAID TO HIMSELF WAS FOREVER ENTHRONED IN HIS SOUL NOOTHER WOMAN COULD SIT HIGHER THAN HER FOOTSTOOL AND IF HE COULD HAVEWRITTEN OUT IN IMMORTAL SYLLABLES THE EFFECT SHE WROUGHT WITHIN HIM HEMIGHT HAVE BOASTED AFTER THE EXAMPLE OF OLD DRAYTON THATQUEENS HEREAFTER MIGHT BE GLAD TO LIVEUPON THE ALMS OF HER SUPERFLUOUS PRAISE
BUT THIS RESULT WAS QUESTIONABLE
 AND WHAT ELSE COULD HE DO FORDOROTHEA
 WHAT WAS HIS DEVOTION WORTH TO HER
 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TOTELL
 HE WOULD NOT GO OUT OF HER REACH
 HE SAW NO CREATURE AMONG HERFRIENDS TO WHOM HE COULD BELIEVE THAT SHE SPOKE WITH THE SAME SIMPLECONFIDENCE AS TO HIM
 SHE HAD ONCE SAID THAT SHE WOULD LIKE HIM TOSTAY AND STAY HE WOULD WHATEVER FIREBREATHING DRAGONS MIGHT HISSAROUND HER
THIS HAD ALWAYS BEEN THE CONCLUSION OF WILLS HESITATIONS
 BUT HE WASNOT WITHOUT CONTRADICTORINESS AND REBELLION EVEN TOWARDS HIS OWNRESOLVE
 HE HAD OFTEN GOT IRRITATED AS HE WAS ON THIS PARTICULARNIGHT BY SOME OUTSIDE DEMONSTRATION THAT HIS PUBLIC EXERTIONS WITH MR
BROOKE AS A CHIEF COULD NOT SEEM AS HEROIC AS HE WOULD LIKE THEM TO BEAND THIS WAS ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OTHER GROUND OF IRRITATIONTHATNOTWITHSTANDING HIS SACRIFICE OF DIGNITY FOR DOROTHEAS SAKE HE COULDHARDLY EVER SEE HER
 WHEREUPON NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTRADICT THESEUNPLEASANT FACTS HE CONTRADICTED HIS OWN STRONGEST BIAS AND SAID IAM A FOOL
NEVERTHELESS SINCE THE INWARD DEBATE NECESSARILY TURNED ON DOROTHEAHE ENDED AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE ONLY BY GETTING A LIVELIER SENSE OFWHAT HER PRESENCE WOULD BE TO HIM AND SUDDENLY REFLECTING THAT THEMORROW WOULD BE SUNDAY HE DETERMINED TO GO TO LOWICK CHURCH AND SEEHER
 HE SLEPT UPON THAT IDEA BUT WHEN HE WAS DRESSING IN THE RATIONALMORNING LIGHT OBJECTION SAIDTHAT WILL BE A VIRTUAL DEFIANCE OF MR
 CASAUBONS PROHIBITION TO VISITLOWICK AND DOROTHEA WILL BE DISPLEASED
NONSENSE
 ARGUED INCLINATION IT WOULD BE TOO MONSTROUS FOR HIM TOHINDER ME FROM GOING OUT TO A PRETTY COUNTRY CHURCH ON A SPRINGMORNING
 AND DOROTHEA WILL BE GLAD
IT WILL BE CLEAR TO MR
 CASAUBON THAT YOU HAVE COME EITHER TO ANNOYHIM OR TO SEE DOROTHEA
IT IS NOT TRUE THAT I GO TO ANNOY HIM AND WHY SHOULD I NOT GO TO SEEDOROTHEA
 IS HE TO HAVE EVERYTHING TO HIMSELF AND BE ALWAYSCOMFORTABLE
 LET HIM SMART A LITTLE AS OTHER PEOPLE ARE OBLIGED TO DO
I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED THE QUAINTNESS OF THE CHURCH AND CONGREGATIONBESIDES I KNOW THE TUCKERS I SHALL GO INTO THEIR PEW
HAVING SILENCED OBJECTION BY FORCE OF UNREASON WILL WALKED TO LOWICKAS IF HE HAD BEEN ON THE WAY TO PARADISE CROSSING HALSELL COMMON ANDSKIRTING THE WOOD WHERE THE SUNLIGHT FELL BROADLY UNDER THE BUDDINGBOUGHS BRINGING OUT THE BEAUTIES OF MOSS AND LICHEN AND FRESH GREENGROWTHS PIERCING THE BROWN
 EVERYTHING SEEMED TO KNOW THAT IT WASSUNDAY AND TO APPROVE OF HIS GOING TO LOWICK CHURCH
 WILL EASILY FELTHAPPY WHEN NOTHING CROSSED HIS HUMOR AND BY THIS TIME THE THOUGHT OFVEXING MR
 CASAUBON HAD BECOME RATHER AMUSING TO HIM MAKING HIS FACEBREAK INTO ITS MERRY SMILE PLEASANT TO SEE AS THE BREAKING OF SUNSHINEON THE WATERTHOUGH THE OCCASION WAS NOT EXEMPLARY
 BUT MOST OF US AREAPT TO SETTLE WITHIN OURSELVES THAT THE MAN WHO BLOCKS OUR WAY ISODIOUS AND NOT TO MIND CAUSING HIM A LITTLE OF THE DISGUST WHICH HISPERSONALITY EXCITES IN OURSELVES
 WILL WENT ALONG WITH A SMALL BOOKUNDER HIS ARM AND A HAND IN EACH SIDEPOCKET NEVER READING BUTCHANTING A LITTLE AS HE MADE SCENES OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN CHURCH ANDCOMING OUT
 HE WAS EXPERIMENTING IN TUNES TO SUIT SOME WORDS OF HISOWN SOMETIMES TRYING A READYMADE MELODY SOMETIMES IMPROVISING
 THEWORDS WERE NOT EXACTLY A HYMN BUT THEY CERTAINLY FITTED HIS SUNDAYEXPERIENCEO ME O ME WHAT FRUGAL CHEER    MY LOVE DOTH FEED UPON
A TOUCH A RAY THAT IS NOT HERE    A SHADOW THAT IS GONEA DREAM OF BREATH THAT MIGHT BE NEAR    AN INLYECHOED TONETHE THOUGHT THAT ONE MAY THINK ME DEAR    THE PLACE WHERE ONE WAS KNOWNTHE TREMOR OF A BANISHED FEAR     AN ILL THAT WAS NOT DONEO ME O ME WHAT FRUGAL CHEER    MY LOVE DOTH FEED UPON
SOMETIMES WHEN HE TOOK OFF HIS HAT SHAKING HIS HEAD BACKWARD ANDSHOWING HIS DELICATE THROAT AS HE SANG HE LOOKED LIKE AN INCARNATIONOF THE SPRING WHOSE SPIRIT FILLED THE AIRA BRIGHT CREATURE ABUNDANTIN UNCERTAIN PROMISES
THE BELLS WERE STILL RINGING WHEN HE GOT TO LOWICK AND HE WENT INTOTHE CURATES PEW BEFORE ANY ONE ELSE ARRIVED THERE
 BUT HE WAS STILLLEFT ALONE IN IT WHEN THE CONGREGATION HAD ASSEMBLED
 THE CURATES PEWWAS OPPOSITE THE RECTORS AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE SMALL CHANCEL ANDWILL HAD TIME TO FEAR THAT DOROTHEA MIGHT NOT COME WHILE HE LOOKEDROUND AT THE GROUP OF RURAL FACES WHICH MADE THE CONGREGATION FROM YEARTO YEAR WITHIN THE WHITEWASHED WALLS AND DARK OLD PEWS HARDLY WITHMORE CHANGE THAN WE SEE IN THE BOUGHS OF A TREE WHICH BREAKS HERE ANDTHERE WITH AGE BUT YET HAS YOUNG SHOOTS
 MR
 RIGGS FROGFACE WASSOMETHING ALIEN AND UNACCOUNTABLE BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS SHOCK TOTHE ORDER OF THINGS THERE WERE STILL THE WAULES AND THE RURAL STOCK OFTHE POWDERELLS IN THEIR PEWS SIDE BY SIDE BROTHER SAMUELS CHEEK HADTHE SAME PURPLE ROUND AS EVER AND THE THREE GENERATIONS OF DECENTCOTTAGERS CAME AS OF OLD WITH A SENSE OF DUTY TO THEIR BETTERSGENERALLYTHE SMALLER CHILDREN REGARDING MR
 CASAUBON WHO WORE THEBLACK GOWN AND MOUNTED TO THE HIGHEST BOX AS PROBABLY THE CHIEF OF ALLBETTERS AND THE ONE MOST AWFUL IF OFFENDED
 EVEN IN  LOWICK WAS ATPEACE NOT MORE AGITATED BY REFORM THAN BY THE SOLEMN TENOR OF THESUNDAY SERMON
 THE CONGREGATION HAD BEEN USED TO SEEING WILL AT CHURCHIN FORMER DAYS AND NO ONE TOOK MUCH NOTE OF HIM EXCEPT THE CHOIR WHOEXPECTED HIM TO MAKE A FIGURE IN THE SINGING
DOROTHEA DID AT LAST APPEAR ON THIS QUAINT BACKGROUND WALKING UP THESHORT AISLE IN HER WHITE BEAVER BONNET AND GRAY CLOAKTHE SAME SHE HADWORN IN THE VATICAN
 HER FACE BEING FROM HER ENTRANCE TOWARDS THECHANCEL EVEN HER SHORTSIGHTED EYES SOON DISCERNED WILL BUT THERE WASNO OUTWARD SHOW OF HER FEELING EXCEPT A SLIGHT PALENESS AND A GRAVE BOWAS SHE PASSED HIM
 TO HIS OWN SURPRISE WILL FELT SUDDENLYUNCOMFORTABLE AND DARED NOT LOOK AT HER AFTER THEY HAD BOWED TO EACHOTHER
 TWO MINUTES LATER WHEN MR
 CASAUBON CAME OUT OF THE VESTRYAND ENTERING THE PEW SEATED HIMSELF IN FACE OF DOROTHEA WILL FELTHIS PARALYSIS MORE COMPLETE
 HE COULD LOOK NOWHERE EXCEPT AT THE CHOIRIN THE LITTLE GALLERY OVER THE VESTRYDOOR DOROTHEA WAS PERHAPSPAINED AND HE HAD MADE A WRETCHED BLUNDER
 IT WAS NO LONGER AMUSING TOVEX MR
 CASAUBON WHO HAD THE ADVANTAGE PROBABLY OF WATCHING HIM ANDSEEING THAT HE DARED NOT TURN HIS HEAD
 WHY HAD HE NOT IMAGINED THISBEFOREHAND
BUT HE COULD NOT EXPECT THAT HE SHOULD SIT IN THAT SQUAREPEW ALONE UNRELIEVED BY ANY TUCKERS WHO HAD APPARENTLY DEPARTED FROMLOWICK ALTOGETHER FOR A NEW CLERGYMAN WAS IN THE DESK
 STILL HE CALLEDHIMSELF STUPID NOW FOR NOT FORESEEING THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FORHIM TO LOOK TOWARDS DOROTHEANAY THAT SHE MIGHT FEEL HIS COMING ANIMPERTINENCE
 THERE WAS NO DELIVERING HIMSELF FROM HIS CAGE HOWEVERAND WILL FOUND HIS PLACES AND LOOKED AT HIS BOOK AS IF HE HAD BEEN ASCHOOLMISTRESS FEELING THAT THE MORNING SERVICE HAD NEVER BEEN SOIMMEASURABLY LONG BEFORE THAT HE WAS UTTERLY RIDICULOUS OUT OFTEMPER AND MISERABLE
 THIS WAS WHAT A MAN GOT BY WORSHIPPING THE SIGHTOF A WOMAN
 THE CLERK OBSERVED WITH SURPRISE THAT MR
 LADISLAW DID NOTJOIN IN THE TUNE OF HANOVER AND REFLECTED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE A COLD
MR
 CASAUBON DID NOT PREACH THAT MORNING AND THERE WAS NO CHANGE INWILLS SITUATION UNTIL THE BLESSING HAD BEEN PRONOUNCED AND EVERY ONEROSE
 IT WAS THE FASHION AT LOWICK FOR THE BETTERS TO GO OUT FIRST
WITH A SUDDEN DETERMINATION TO BREAK THE SPELL THAT WAS UPON HIM WILLLOOKED STRAIGHT AT MR
 CASAUBON
 BUT THAT GENTLEMANS EYES WERE ON THEBUTTON OF THE PEWDOOR WHICH HE OPENED ALLOWING DOROTHEA TO PASS ANDFOLLOWING HER IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT RAISING HIS EYELIDS
 WILLS GLANCEHAD CAUGHT DOROTHEAS AS SHE TURNED OUT OF THE PEW AND AGAIN SHEBOWED BUT THIS TIME WITH A LOOK OF AGITATION AS IF SHE WEREREPRESSING TEARS
 WILL WALKED OUT AFTER THEM BUT THEY WENT ON TOWARDSTHE LITTLE GATE LEADING OUT OF THE CHURCHYARD INTO THE SHRUBBERY NEVERLOOKING ROUND
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO FOLLOW THEM AND HE COULD ONLY WALK BACKSADLY AT MIDDAY ALONG THE SAME ROAD WHICH HE HAD TRODDEN HOPEFULLY INTHE MORNING
 THE LIGHTS WERE ALL CHANGED FOR HIM BOTH WITHOUT ANDWITHIN
CHAPTER XLVIII
SURELY THE GOLDEN HOURS ARE TURNING GRAYAND DANCE NO MORE AND VAINLY STRIVE TO RUNI SEE THEIR WHITE LOCKS STREAMING IN THE WINDEACH FACE IS HAGGARD AS IT LOOKS AT MESLOW TURNING IN THE CONSTANT CLASPING ROUNDSTORMDRIVEN
DOROTHEAS DISTRESS WHEN SHE WAS LEAVING THE CHURCH CAME CHIEFLY FROMTHE PERCEPTION THAT MR
 CASAUBON WAS DETERMINED NOT TO SPEAK TO HISCOUSIN AND THAT WILLS PRESENCE AT CHURCH HAD SERVED TO MARK MORESTRONGLY THE ALIENATION BETWEEN THEM
 WILLS COMING SEEMED TO HER QUITEEXCUSABLE NAY SHE THOUGHT IT AN AMIABLE MOVEMENT IN HIM TOWARDS ARECONCILIATION WHICH SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY WISHING FOR
 HEHAD PROBABLY IMAGINED AS SHE HAD THAT IF MR
 CASAUBON AND HE COULDMEET EASILY THEY WOULD SHAKE HANDS AND FRIENDLY INTERCOURSE MIGHTRETURN
 BUT NOW DOROTHEA FELT QUITE ROBBED OF THAT HOPE
 WILL WASBANISHED FURTHER THAN EVER FOR MR
 CASAUBON MUST HAVE BEEN NEWLYEMBITTERED BY THIS THRUSTING UPON HIM OF A PRESENCE WHICH HE REFUSED TORECOGNIZE
HE HAD NOT BEEN VERY WELL THAT MORNING SUFFERING FROM SOME DIFFICULTYIN BREATHING AND HAD NOT PREACHED IN CONSEQUENCE SHE WAS NOTSURPRISED THEREFORE THAT HE WAS NEARLY SILENT AT LUNCHEON STILL LESSTHAT HE MADE NO ALLUSION TO WILL LADISLAW
 FOR HER OWN PART SHE FELTTHAT SHE COULD NEVER AGAIN INTRODUCE THAT SUBJECT
 THEY USUALLY SPENTAPART THE HOURS BETWEEN LUNCHEON AND DINNER ON A SUNDAY MR
 CASAUBONIN THE LIBRARY DOZING CHIEFLY AND DOROTHEA IN HER BOUDOIR WHERE SHEWAS WONT TO OCCUPY HERSELF WITH SOME OF HER FAVORITE BOOKS
 THERE WAS ALITTLE HEAP OF THEM ON THE TABLE IN THE BOWWINDOWOF VARIOUS SORTSFROM HERODOTUS WHICH SHE WAS LEARNING TO READ WITH MR
 CASAUBON TOHER OLD COMPANION PASCAL AND KEBLES CHRISTIAN YEAR
 BUT TODAY SHEOPENED ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND COULD READ NONE OF THEM
 EVERYTHINGSEEMED DREARY THE PORTENTS BEFORE THE BIRTH OF CYRUSJEWISHANTIQUITIESOH DEAR
DEVOUT EPIGRAMSTHE SACRED CHIME OF FAVORITEHYMNSALL ALIKE WERE AS FLAT AS TUNES BEATEN ON WOOD EVEN THE SPRINGFLOWERS AND THE GRASS HAD A DULL SHIVER IN THEM UNDER THE AFTERNOONCLOUDS THAT HID THE SUN FITFULLY EVEN THE SUSTAINING THOUGHTS WHICHHAD BECOME HABITS SEEMED TO HAVE IN THEM THE WEARINESS OF LONG FUTUREDAYS IN WHICH SHE WOULD STILL LIVE WITH THEM FOR HER SOLE COMPANIONS
IT WAS ANOTHER OR RATHER A FULLER SORT OF COMPANIONSHIP THAT POORDOROTHEA WAS HUNGERING FOR AND THE HUNGER HAD GROWN FROM THE PERPETUALEFFORT DEMANDED BY HER MARRIED LIFE
 SHE WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO BE WHATHER HUSBAND WISHED AND NEVER ABLE TO REPOSE ON HIS DELIGHT IN WHAT SHEWAS
 THE THING THAT SHE LIKED THAT SHE SPONTANEOUSLY CARED TO HAVESEEMED TO BE ALWAYS EXCLUDED FROM HER LIFE FOR IF IT WAS ONLY GRANTEDAND NOT SHARED BY HER HUSBAND IT MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN DENIED
 ABOUTWILL LADISLAW THERE HAD BEEN A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM FROM THE FIRSTAND IT HAD ENDED SINCE MR
 CASAUBON HAD SO SEVERELY REPULSEDDOROTHEAS STRONG FEELING ABOUT HIS CLAIMS ON THE FAMILY PROPERTY BYHER BEING CONVINCED THAT SHE WAS IN THE RIGHT AND HER HUSBAND IN THEWRONG BUT THAT SHE WAS HELPLESS
 THIS AFTERNOON THE HELPLESSNESS WASMORE WRETCHEDLY BENUMBING THAN EVER SHE LONGED FOR OBJECTS WHO COULDBE DEAR TO HER AND TO WHOM SHE COULD BE DEAR
 SHE LONGED FOR WORKWHICH WOULD BE DIRECTLY BENEFICENT LIKE THE SUNSHINE AND THE RAIN ANDNOW IT APPEARED THAT SHE WAS TO LIVE MORE AND MORE IN A VIRTUAL TOMBWHERE THERE WAS THE APPARATUS OF A GHASTLY LABOR PRODUCING WHAT WOULDNEVER SEE THE LIGHT
 TODAY SHE HAD STOOD AT THE DOOR OF THE TOMB ANDSEEN WILL LADISLAW RECEDING INTO THE DISTANT WORLD OF WARM ACTIVITY ANDFELLOWSHIPTURNING HIS FACE TOWARDS HER AS HE WENT
BOOKS WERE OF NO USE
 THINKING WAS OF NO USE
 IT WAS SUNDAY AND SHECOULD NOT HAVE THE CARRIAGE TO GO TO CELIA WHO HAD LATELY HAD A BABY
THERE WAS NO REFUGE NOW FROM SPIRITUAL EMPTINESS AND DISCONTENT ANDDOROTHEA HAD TO BEAR HER BAD MOOD AS SHE WOULD HAVE BORNE A HEADACHE
AFTER DINNER AT THE HOUR WHEN SHE USUALLY BEGAN TO READ ALOUD MR
CASAUBON PROPOSED THAT THEY SHOULD GO INTO THE LIBRARY WHERE HE SAIDHE HAD ORDERED A FIRE AND LIGHTS
 HE SEEMED TO HAVE REVIVED AND TO BETHINKING INTENTLY
IN THE LIBRARY DOROTHEA OBSERVED THAT HE HAD NEWLY ARRANGED A ROW OFHIS NOTEBOOKS ON A TABLE AND NOW HE TOOK UP AND PUT INTO HER HAND AWELLKNOWN VOLUME WHICH WAS A TABLE OF CONTENTS TO ALL THE OTHERS
YOU WILL OBLIGE ME MY DEAR HE SAID SEATING HIMSELF IF INSTEAD OFOTHER READING THIS EVENING YOU WILL GO THROUGH THIS ALOUD PENCIL INHAND AND AT EACH POINT WHERE I SAY MARK WILL MAKE A CROSS WITH YOURPENCIL
 THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN A SIFTING PROCESS WHICH I HAVE LONGHAD IN VIEW AND AS WE GO ON I SHALL BE ABLE TO INDICATE TO YOU CERTAINPRINCIPLES OF SELECTION WHEREBY YOU WILL I TRUST HAVE AN INTELLIGENTPARTICIPATION IN MY PURPOSE
THIS PROPOSAL WAS ONLY ONE MORE SIGN ADDED TO MANY SINCE HIS MEMORABLEINTERVIEW WITH LYDGATE THAT MR
 CASAUBONS ORIGINAL RELUCTANCE TO LETDOROTHEA WORK WITH HIM HAD GIVEN PLACE TO THE CONTRARY DISPOSITIONNAMELY TO DEMAND MUCH INTEREST AND LABOR FROM HER
AFTER SHE HAD READ AND MARKED FOR TWO HOURS HE SAID WE WILL TAKE THEVOLUME UPSTAIRSAND THE PENCIL IF YOU PLEASEAND IN CASE OF READINGIN THE NIGHT WE CAN PURSUE THIS TASK
 IT IS NOT WEARISOME TO YOU ITRUST DOROTHEA
I PREFER ALWAYS READING WHAT YOU LIKE BEST TO HEAR SAID DOROTHEAWHO TOLD THE SIMPLE TRUTH FOR WHAT SHE DREADED WAS TO EXERT HERSELF INREADING OR ANYTHING ELSE WHICH LEFT HIM AS JOYLESS AS EVER
IT WAS A PROOF OF THE FORCE WITH WHICH CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS INDOROTHEA IMPRESSED THOSE AROUND HER THAT HER HUSBAND WITH ALL HISJEALOUSY AND SUSPICION HAD GATHERED IMPLICIT TRUST IN THE INTEGRITY OFHER PROMISES AND HER POWER OF DEVOTING HERSELF TO HER IDEA OF THERIGHT AND BEST
 OF LATE HE HAD BEGUN TO FEEL THAT THESE QUALITIES WEREA PECULIAR POSSESSION FOR HIMSELF AND HE WANTED TO ENGROSS THEM
THE READING IN THE NIGHT DID COME
 DOROTHEA IN HER YOUNG WEARINESS HADSLEPT SOON AND FAST SHE WAS AWAKENED BY A SENSE OF LIGHT WHICH SEEMEDTO HER AT FIRST LIKE A SUDDEN VISION OF SUNSET AFTER SHE HAD CLIMBED ASTEEP HILL SHE OPENED HER EYES AND SAW HER HUSBAND WRAPPED IN HIS WARMGOWN SEATING HIMSELF IN THE ARMCHAIR NEAR THE FIREPLACE WHERE THEEMBERS WERE STILL GLOWING
 HE HAD LIT TWO CANDLES EXPECTING THATDOROTHEA WOULD AWAKE BUT NOT LIKING TO ROUSE HER BY MORE DIRECT MEANS
ARE YOU ILL EDWARD
 SHE SAID RISING IMMEDIATELY
I FELT SOME UNEASINESS IN A RECLINING POSTURE
 I WILL SIT HERE FOR ATIME
 SHE THREW WOOD ON THE FIRE WRAPPED HERSELF UP AND SAID YOUWOULD LIKE ME TO READ TO YOU
YOU WOULD OBLIGE ME GREATLY BY DOING SO DOROTHEA SAID MR
 CASAUBONWITH A SHADE MORE MEEKNESS THAN USUAL IN HIS POLITE MANNER
 I AMWAKEFUL MY MIND IS REMARKABLY LUCID
I FEAR THAT THE EXCITEMENT MAY BE TOO GREAT FOR YOU SAID DOROTHEAREMEMBERING LYDGATES CAUTIONS
NO I AM NOT CONSCIOUS OF UNDUE EXCITEMENT
 THOUGHT IS EASY
 DOROTHEADARED NOT INSIST AND SHE READ FOR AN HOUR OR MORE ON THE SAME PLAN ASSHE HAD DONE IN THE EVENING BUT GETTING OVER THE PAGES WITH MOREQUICKNESS
 MR
 CASAUBONS MIND WAS MORE ALERT AND HE SEEMED TOANTICIPATE WHAT WAS COMING AFTER A VERY SLIGHT VERBAL INDICATIONSAYING THAT WILL DOMARK THATOR PASS ON TO THE NEXT HEADI OMITTHE SECOND EXCURSUS ON CRETE
 DOROTHEA WAS AMAZED TO THINK OF THEBIRDLIKE SPEED WITH WHICH HIS MIND WAS SURVEYING THE GROUND WHERE ITHAD BEEN CREEPING FOR YEARS
 AT LAST HE SAIDCLOSE THE BOOK NOW MY DEAR
 WE WILL RESUME OUR WORK TOMORROW
 I HAVEDEFERRED IT TOO LONG AND WOULD GLADLY SEE IT COMPLETED
 BUT YOUOBSERVE THAT THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH MY SELECTION IS MADE IS TO GIVEADEQUATE AND NOT DISPROPORTIONATE ILLUSTRATION TO EACH OF THE THESESENUMERATED IN MY INTRODUCTION AS AT PRESENT SKETCHED
 YOU HAVEPERCEIVED THAT DISTINCTLY DOROTHEA
YES SAID DOROTHEA RATHER TREMULOUSLY
 SHE FELT SICK AT HEART
AND NOW I THINK THAT I CAN TAKE SOME REPOSE SAID MR
 CASAUBON
 HELAID DOWN AGAIN AND BEGGED HER TO PUT OUT THE LIGHTS
 WHEN SHE HAD LAINDOWN TOO AND THERE WAS A DARKNESS ONLY BROKEN BY A DULL GLOW ON THEHEARTH HE SAIDBEFORE I SLEEP I HAVE A REQUEST TO MAKE DOROTHEA
WHAT IS IT
 SAID DOROTHEA WITH DREAD IN HER MIND
IT IS THAT YOU WILL LET ME KNOW DELIBERATELY WHETHER IN CASE OF MYDEATH YOU WILL CARRY OUT MY WISHES WHETHER YOU WILL AVOID DOING WHATI SHOULD DEPRECATE AND APPLY YOURSELF TO DO WHAT I SHOULD DESIRE
DOROTHEA WAS NOT TAKEN BY SURPRISE MANY INCIDENTS HAD BEEN LEADING HERTO THE CONJECTURE OF SOME INTENTION ON HER HUSBANDS PART WHICH MIGHTMAKE A NEW YOKE FOR HER
 SHE DID NOT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY
YOU REFUSE
 SAID MR
 CASAUBON WITH MORE EDGE IN HIS TONE
NO I DO NOT YET REFUSE SAID DOROTHEA IN A CLEAR VOICE THE NEED OFFREEDOM ASSERTING ITSELF WITHIN HER BUT IT IS TOO SOLEMNI THINK ITIS NOT RIGHTTO MAKE A PROMISE WHEN I AM IGNORANT WHAT IT WILL BIND METO
 WHATEVER AFFECTION PROMPTED I WOULD DO WITHOUT PROMISING
BUT YOU WOULD USE YOUR OWN JUDGMENT I ASK YOU TO OBEY MINE YOUREFUSE
NO DEAR NO
 SAID DOROTHEA BESEECHINGLY CRUSHED BY OPPOSING FEARS
BUT MAY I WAIT AND REFLECT A LITTLE WHILE
 I DESIRE WITH MY WHOLE SOULTO DO WHAT WILL COMFORT YOU BUT I CANNOT GIVE ANY PLEDGESUDDENLYSTILL LESS A PLEDGE TO DO I KNOW NOT WHAT
YOU CANNOT THEN CONFIDE IN THE NATURE OF MY WISHES
GRANT ME TILL TOMORROW SAID DOROTHEA BESEECHINGLY
TILL TOMORROW THEN SAID MR
 CASAUBON
SOON SHE COULD HEAR THAT HE WAS SLEEPING BUT THERE WAS NO MORE SLEEPFOR HER
 WHILE SHE CONSTRAINED HERSELF TO LIE STILL LEST SHE SHOULDDISTURB HIM HER MIND WAS CARRYING ON A CONFLICT IN WHICH IMAGINATIONRANGED ITS FORCES FIRST ON ONE SIDE AND THEN ON THE OTHER
 SHE HAD NOPRESENTIMENT THAT THE POWER WHICH HER HUSBAND WISHED TO ESTABLISH OVERHER FUTURE ACTION HAD RELATION TO ANYTHING ELSE THAN HIS WORK
 BUT ITWAS CLEAR ENOUGH TO HER THAT HE WOULD EXPECT HER TO DEVOTE HERSELF TOSIFTING THOSE MIXED HEAPS OF MATERIAL WHICH WERE TO BE THE DOUBTFULILLUSTRATION OF PRINCIPLES STILL MORE DOUBTFUL
 THE POOR CHILD HADBECOME ALTOGETHER UNBELIEVING AS TO THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF THAT KEYWHICH HAD MADE THE AMBITION AND THE LABOR OF HER HUSBANDS LIFE
 IT WASNOT WONDERFUL THAT IN SPITE OF HER SMALL INSTRUCTION HER JUDGMENT INTHIS MATTER WAS TRUER THAN HIS FOR SHE LOOKED WITH UNBIASSEDCOMPARISON AND HEALTHY SENSE AT PROBABILITIES ON WHICH HE HAD RISKEDALL HIS EGOISM
 AND NOW SHE PICTURED TO HERSELF THE DAYS AND MONTHSAND YEARS WHICH SHE MUST SPEND IN SORTING WHAT MIGHT BE CALLEDSHATTERED MUMMIES AND FRAGMENTS OF A TRADITION WHICH WAS ITSELF AMOSAIC WROUGHT FROM CRUSHED RUINSSORTING THEM AS FOOD FOR A THEORYWHICH WAS ALREADY WITHERED IN THE BIRTH LIKE AN ELFIN CHILD
 DOUBTLESSA VIGOROUS ERROR VIGOROUSLY PURSUED HAS KEPT THE EMBRYOS OF TRUTHABREATHING THE QUEST OF GOLD BEING AT THE SAME TIME A QUESTIONING OFSUBSTANCES THE BODY OF CHEMISTRY IS PREPARED FOR ITS SOUL ANDLAVOISIER IS BORN
 BUT MR
 CASAUBONS THEORY OF THE ELEMENTS WHICH MADETHE SEED OF ALL TRADITION WAS NOT LIKELY TO BRUISE ITSELF UNAWARESAGAINST DISCOVERIES IT FLOATED AMONG FLEXIBLE CONJECTURES NO MORESOLID THAN THOSE ETYMOLOGIES WHICH SEEMED STRONG BECAUSE OF LIKENESS INSOUND UNTIL IT WAS SHOWN THAT LIKENESS IN SOUND MADE THEM IMPOSSIBLEIT WAS A METHOD OF INTERPRETATION WHICH WAS NOT TESTED BY THE NECESSITYOF FORMING ANYTHING WHICH HAD SHARPER COLLISIONS THAN AN ELABORATENOTION OF GOG AND MAGOG IT WAS AS FREE FROM INTERRUPTION AS A PLAN FORTHREADING THE STARS TOGETHER
 AND DOROTHEA HAD SO OFTEN HAD TO CHECKHER WEARINESS AND IMPATIENCE OVER THIS QUESTIONABLE RIDDLEGUESSING ASIT REVEALED ITSELF TO HER INSTEAD OF THE FELLOWSHIP IN HIGH KNOWLEDGEWHICH WAS TO MAKE LIFE WORTHIER
 SHE COULD UNDERSTAND WELL ENOUGH NOWWHY HER HUSBAND HAD COME TO CLING TO HER AS POSSIBLY THE ONLY HOPELEFT THAT HIS LABORS WOULD EVER TAKE A SHAPE IN WHICH THEY COULD BEGIVEN TO THE WORLD
 AT FIRST IT HAD SEEMED THAT HE WISHED TO KEEP EVENHER ALOOF FROM ANY CLOSE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT HE WAS DOING BUT GRADUALLYTHE TERRIBLE STRINGENCY OF HUMAN NEEDTHE PROSPECT OF A TOO SPEEDYDEATHAND HERE DOROTHEAS PITY TURNED FROM HER OWN FUTURE TO HER HUSBANDSPASTNAY TO HIS PRESENT HARD STRUGGLE WITH A LOT WHICH HAD GROWN OUTOF THAT PAST THE LONELY LABOR THE AMBITION BREATHING HARDLY UNDER THEPRESSURE OF SELFDISTRUST THE GOAL RECEDING AND THE HEAVIER LIMBSAND NOW AT LAST THE SWORD VISIBLY TREMBLING ABOVE HIM
 AND HAD SHE NOTWISHED TO MARRY HIM THAT SHE MIGHT HELP HIM IN HIS LIFES LABOR
BUTSHE HAD THOUGHT THE WORK WAS TO BE SOMETHING GREATER WHICH SHE COULDSERVE IN DEVOUTLY FOR ITS OWN SAKE
 WAS IT RIGHT EVEN TO SOOTHE HISGRIEFWOULD IT BE POSSIBLE EVEN IF SHE PROMISEDTO WORK AS IN ATREADMILL FRUITLESSLY
AND YET COULD SHE DENY HIM
 COULD SHE SAY I REFUSE TO CONTENT THISPINING HUNGER
 IT WOULD BE REFUSING TO DO FOR HIM DEAD WHAT SHE WASALMOST SURE TO DO FOR HIM LIVING
 IF HE LIVED AS LYDGATE HAD SAID HEMIGHT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS OR MORE HER LIFE WOULD CERTAINLY BE SPENT INHELPING HIM AND OBEYING HIM
STILL THERE WAS A DEEP DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT DEVOTION TO THE LIVINGAND THAT INDEFINITE PROMISE OF DEVOTION TO THE DEAD
 WHILE HE LIVED HECOULD CLAIM NOTHING THAT SHE WOULD NOT STILL BE FREE TO REMONSTRATEAGAINST AND EVEN TO REFUSE
 BUTTHE THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH HER MINDMORE THAN ONCE THOUGH SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE IN ITMIGHT HE NOT MEAN TODEMAND SOMETHING MORE FROM HER THAN SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO IMAGINE SINCEHE WANTED HER PLEDGE TO CARRY OUT HIS WISHES WITHOUT TELLING HEREXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE
 NO HIS HEART WAS BOUND UP IN HIS WORK ONLYTHAT WAS THE END FOR WHICH HIS FAILING LIFE WAS TO BE EKED OUT BY HERS
AND NOW IF SHE WERE TO SAY NO
 IF YOU DIE I WILL PUT NO FINGER TOYOUR WORKIT SEEMED AS IF SHE WOULD BE CRUSHING THAT BRUISED HEART
FOR FOUR HOURS DOROTHEA LAY IN THIS CONFLICT TILL SHE FELT ILL ANDBEWILDERED UNABLE TO RESOLVE PRAYING MUTELY
 HELPLESS AS A CHILDWHICH HAS SOBBED AND SOUGHT TOO LONG SHE FELL INTO A LATE MORNINGSLEEP AND WHEN SHE WAKED MR
 CASAUBON WAS ALREADY UP
 TANTRIPP TOLDHER THAT HE HAD READ PRAYERS BREAKFASTED AND WAS IN THE LIBRARY
I NEVER SAW YOU LOOK SO PALE MADAM SAID TANTRIPP A SOLIDFIGUREDWOMAN WHO HAD BEEN WITH THE SISTERS AT LAUSANNE
WAS I EVER HIGHCOLORED TANTRIPP
 SAID DOROTHEA SMILING FAINTLY
WELL NOT TO SAY HIGHCOLORED BUT WITH A BLOOM LIKE A CHINY ROSE
 BUTALWAYS SMELLING THOSE LEATHER BOOKS WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED
 DO REST ALITTLE THIS MORNING MADAM
 LET ME SAY YOU ARE ILL AND NOT ABLE TO GOINTO THAT CLOSE LIBRARY
OH NO NO
 LET ME MAKE HASTE SAID DOROTHEA
 MR
 CASAUBON WANTS MEPARTICULARLY
WHEN SHE WENT DOWN SHE FELT SURE THAT SHE SHOULD PROMISE TO FULFIL HISWISHES BUT THAT WOULD BE LATER IN THE DAYNOT YET
AS DOROTHEA ENTERED THE LIBRARY MR
 CASAUBON TURNED ROUND FROM THETABLE WHERE HE HAD BEEN PLACING SOME BOOKS AND SAIDI WAS WAITING FOR YOUR APPEARANCE MY DEAR
 I HAD HOPED TO SET TO WORKAT ONCE THIS MORNING BUT I FIND MYSELF UNDER SOME INDISPOSITIONPROBABLY FROM TOO MUCH EXCITEMENT YESTERDAY
 I AM GOING NOW TO TAKE ATURN IN THE SHRUBBERY SINCE THE AIR IS MILDER
I AM GLAD TO HEAR THAT SAID DOROTHEA
 YOUR MIND I FEARED WAS TOOACTIVE LAST NIGHT
I WOULD FAIN HAVE IT SET AT REST ON THE POINT I LAST SPOKE OFDOROTHEA
 YOU CAN NOW I HOPE GIVE ME AN ANSWER
MAY I COME OUT TO YOU IN THE GARDEN PRESENTLY
 SAID DOROTHEA WINNINGA LITTLE BREATHING SPACE IN THAT WAY
I SHALL BE IN THE YEWTREE WALK FOR THE NEXT HALFHOUR SAID MR
CASAUBON AND THEN HE LEFT HER
DOROTHEA FEELING VERY WEARY RANG AND ASKED TANTRIPP TO BRING HER SOMEWRAPS
 SHE HAD BEEN SITTING STILL FOR A FEW MINUTES BUT NOT IN ANYRENEWAL OF THE FORMER CONFLICT SHE SIMPLY FELT THAT SHE WAS GOING TOSAY YES TO HER OWN DOOM SHE WAS TOO WEAK TOO FULL OF DREAD AT THETHOUGHT OF INFLICTING A KEENEDGED BLOW ON HER HUSBAND TO DO ANYTHINGBUT SUBMIT COMPLETELY
 SHE SAT STILL AND LET TANTRIPP PUT ON HER BONNETAND SHAWL A PASSIVITY WHICH WAS UNUSUAL WITH HER FOR SHE LIKED TOWAIT ON HERSELF
GOD BLESS YOU MADAM
 SAID TANTRIPP WITH AN IRREPRESSIBLE MOVEMENTOF LOVE TOWARDS THE BEAUTIFUL GENTLE CREATURE FOR WHOM SHE FELT UNABLETO DO ANYTHING MORE NOW THAT SHE HAD FINISHED TYING THE BONNET
THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR DOROTHEAS HIGHLYSTRUNG FEELING AND SHE BURSTINTO TEARS SOBBING AGAINST TANTRIPPS ARM
 BUT SOON SHE CHECKEDHERSELF DRIED HER EYES AND WENT OUT AT THE GLASS DOOR INTO THESHRUBBERY
I WISH EVERY BOOK IN THAT LIBRARY WAS BUILT INTO A CATICOM FOR YOURMASTER SAID TANTRIPP TO PRATT THE BUTLER FINDING HIM IN THEBREAKFASTROOM
 SHE HAD BEEN AT ROME AND VISITED THE ANTIQUITIES ASWE KNOW AND SHE ALWAYS DECLINED TO CALL MR
 CASAUBON ANYTHING BUTYOUR MASTER WHEN SPEAKING TO THE OTHER SERVANTS
PRATT LAUGHED
 HE LIKED HIS MASTER VERY WELL BUT HE LIKED TANTRIPPBETTER
WHEN DOROTHEA WAS OUT ON THE GRAVEL WALKS SHE LINGERED AMONG THENEARER CLUMPS OF TREES HESITATING AS SHE HAD DONE ONCE BEFORE THOUGHFROM A DIFFERENT CAUSE
 THEN SHE HAD FEARED LEST HER EFFORT ATFELLOWSHIP SHOULD BE UNWELCOME NOW SHE DREADED GOING TO THE SPOT WHERESHE FORESAW THAT SHE MUST BIND HERSELF TO A FELLOWSHIP FROM WHICH SHESHRANK
 NEITHER LAW NOR THE WORLDS OPINION COMPELLED HER TO THISONLYHER HUSBANDS NATURE AND HER OWN COMPASSION ONLY THE IDEAL AND NOT THEREAL YOKE OF MARRIAGE
 SHE SAW CLEARLY ENOUGH THE WHOLE SITUATION YETSHE WAS FETTERED SHE COULD NOT SMITE THE STRICKEN SOUL THAT ENTREATEDHERS
 IF THAT WERE WEAKNESS DOROTHEA WAS WEAK
 BUT THE HALFHOUR WASPASSING AND SHE MUST NOT DELAY LONGER
 WHEN SHE ENTERED THE YEWTREEWALK SHE COULD NOT SEE HER HUSBAND BUT THE WALK HAD BENDS AND SHEWENT EXPECTING TO CATCH SIGHT OF HIS FIGURE WRAPPED IN A BLUE CLOAKWHICH WITH A WARM VELVET CAP WAS HIS OUTER GARMENT ON CHILL DAYS FORTHE GARDEN
 IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT HE MIGHT BE RESTING IN THESUMMERHOUSE TOWARDS WHICH THE PATH DIVERGED A LITTLE
 TURNING THEANGLE SHE COULD SEE HIM SEATED ON THE BENCH CLOSE TO A STONE TABLE
HIS ARMS WERE RESTING ON THE TABLE AND HIS BROW WAS BOWED DOWN ONTHEM THE BLUE CLOAK BEING DRAGGED FORWARD AND SCREENING HIS FACE ONEACH SIDE
HE EXHAUSTED HIMSELF LAST NIGHT DOROTHEA SAID TO HERSELF THINKINGAT FIRST THAT HE WAS ASLEEP AND THAT THE SUMMERHOUSE WAS TOO DAMP APLACE TO REST IN
 BUT THEN SHE REMEMBERED THAT OF LATE SHE HAD SEEN HIMTAKE THAT ATTITUDE WHEN SHE WAS READING TO HIM AS IF HE FOUND ITEASIER THAN ANY OTHER AND THAT HE WOULD SOMETIMES SPEAK AS WELL ASLISTEN WITH HIS FACE DOWN IN THAT WAY
 SHE WENT INTO THE SUMMERHOUSEAND SAID I AM COME EDWARD I AM READY
HE TOOK NO NOTICE AND SHE THOUGHT THAT HE MUST BE FAST ASLEEP
 SHELAID HER HAND ON HIS SHOULDER AND REPEATED I AM READY
 STILL HE WASMOTIONLESS AND WITH A SUDDEN CONFUSED FEAR SHE LEANED DOWN TO HIMTOOK OFF HIS VELVET CAP AND LEANED HER CHEEK CLOSE TO HIS HEAD CRYINGIN A DISTRESSED TONEWAKE DEAR WAKE
 LISTEN TO ME
 I AM COME TO ANSWER
 BUT DOROTHEANEVER GAVE HER ANSWER
LATER IN THE DAY LYDGATE WAS SEATED BY HER BEDSIDE AND SHE WASTALKING DELIRIOUSLY THINKING ALOUD AND RECALLING WHAT HAD GONETHROUGH HER MIND THE NIGHT BEFORE
 SHE KNEW HIM AND CALLED HIM BY HISNAME BUT APPEARED TO THINK IT RIGHT THAT SHE SHOULD EXPLAIN EVERYTHINGTO HIM AND AGAIN AND AGAIN BEGGED HIM TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO HERHUSBAND
TELL HIM I SHALL GO TO HIM SOON I AM READY TO PROMISE
 ONLY THINKINGABOUT IT WAS SO DREADFULIT HAS MADE ME ILL
 NOT VERY ILL
 I SHALL SOONBE BETTER
 GO AND TELL HIM
BUT THE SILENCE IN HER HUSBANDS EAR WAS NEVER MORE TO BE BROKEN
CHAPTER XLIX
A TASK TOO STRONG FOR WIZARD SPELLSTHIS SQUIRE HAD BROUGHT ABOUTT IS EASY DROPPING STONES IN WELLSBUT WHO SHALL GET THEM OUT
I WISH TO GOD WE COULD HINDER DOROTHEA FROM KNOWING THIS SAID SIRJAMES CHETTAM WITH A LITTLE FROWN ON HIS BROW AND AN EXPRESSION OFINTENSE DISGUST ABOUT HIS MOUTH
HE WAS STANDING ON THE HEARTHRUG IN THE LIBRARY AT LOWICK GRANGE ANDSPEAKING TO MR
 BROOKE
 IT WAS THE DAY AFTER MR
 CASAUBON HAD BEENBURIED AND DOROTHEA WAS NOT YET ABLE TO LEAVE HER ROOM
THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT YOU KNOW CHETTAM AS SHE IS AN EXECUTRIXAND SHE LIKES TO GO INTO THESE THINGSPROPERTY LAND THAT KIND OFTHING
 SHE HAS HER NOTIONS YOU KNOW SAID MR
 BROOKE STICKING HISEYEGLASSES ON NERVOUSLY AND EXPLORING THE EDGES OF A FOLDED PAPERWHICH HE HELD IN HIS HAND AND SHE WOULD LIKE TO ACTDEPEND UPON ITAS AN EXECUTRIX DOROTHEA WOULD WANT TO ACT
 AND SHE WAS TWENTYONE LASTDECEMBER YOU KNOW
 I CAN HINDER NOTHING
SIR JAMES LOOKED AT THE CARPET FOR A MINUTE IN SILENCE AND THENLIFTING HIS EYES SUDDENLY FIXED THEM ON MR
 BROOKE SAYING I WILLTELL YOU WHAT WE CAN DO
 UNTIL DOROTHEA IS WELL ALL BUSINESS MUST BEKEPT FROM HER AND AS SOON AS SHE IS ABLE TO BE MOVED SHE MUST COME TOUS
 BEING WITH CELIA AND THE BABY WILL BE THE BEST THING IN THE WORLDFOR HER AND WILL PASS AWAY THE TIME
 AND MEANWHILE YOU MUST GET RID OFLADISLAW YOU MUST SEND HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY
 HERE SIR JAMESS LOOKOF DISGUST RETURNED IN ALL ITS INTENSITY
MR
 BROOKE PUT HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM WALKED TO THE WINDOW ANDSTRAIGHTENED HIS BACK WITH A LITTLE SHAKE BEFORE HE REPLIED
THAT IS EASILY SAID CHETTAM EASILY SAID YOU KNOW
MY DEAR SIR PERSISTED SIR JAMES RESTRAINING HIS INDIGNATION WITHINRESPECTFUL FORMS IT WAS YOU WHO BROUGHT HIM HERE AND YOU WHO KEEPHIM HEREI MEAN BY THE OCCUPATION YOU GIVE HIM
YES BUT I CANT DISMISS HIM IN AN INSTANT WITHOUT ASSIGNING REASONSMY DEAR CHETTAM
 LADISLAW HAS BEEN INVALUABLE MOST SATISFACTORY
 ICONSIDER THAT I HAVE DONE THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY A SERVICE BYBRINGING HIMBY BRINGING HIM YOU KNOW
 MR
 BROOKE ENDED WITH A NODTURNING ROUND TO GIVE IT
ITS A PITY THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY DIDNT DO WITHOUT HIM THATS ALLI HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT
 AT ANY RATE AS DOROTHEAS BROTHERINLAW IFEEL WARRANTED IN OBJECTING STRONGLY TO HIS BEING KEPT HERE BY ANYACTION ON THE PART OF HER FRIENDS
 YOU ADMIT I HOPE THAT I HAVE ARIGHT TO SPEAK ABOUT WHAT CONCERNS THE DIGNITY OF MY WIFES SISTER
SIR JAMES WAS GETTING WARM
OF COURSE MY DEAR CHETTAM OF COURSE
 BUT YOU AND I HAVE DIFFERENTIDEASDIFFERENTNOT ABOUT THIS ACTION OF CASAUBONS I SHOULD HOPE INTERRUPTED SIRJAMES
 I SAY THAT HE HAS MOST UNFAIRLY COMPROMISED DOROTHEA
 I SAYTHAT THERE NEVER WAS A MEANER MORE UNGENTLEMANLY ACTION THAN THISACODICIL OF THIS SORT TO A WILL WHICH HE MADE AT THE TIME OF HISMARRIAGE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND RELIANCE OF HER FAMILYA POSITIVEINSULT TO DOROTHEA
WELL YOU KNOW CASAUBON WAS A LITTLE TWISTED ABOUT LADISLAW
 LADISLAWHAS TOLD ME THE REASONDISLIKE OF THE BENT HE TOOK YOU KNOWLADISLAWDIDNT THINK MUCH OF CASAUBONS NOTIONS THOTH AND DAGONTHAT SORT OFTHING AND I FANCY THAT CASAUBON DIDNT LIKE THE INDEPENDENT POSITIONLADISLAW HAD TAKEN UP
 I SAW THE LETTERS BETWEEN THEM YOU KNOW
 POORCASAUBON WAS A LITTLE BURIED IN BOOKSHE DIDNT KNOW THE WORLD
ITS ALL VERY WELL FOR LADISLAW TO PUT THAT COLOR ON IT SAID SIRJAMES
 BUT I BELIEVE CASAUBON WAS ONLY JEALOUS OF HIM ON DOROTHEASACCOUNT AND THE WORLD WILL SUPPOSE THAT SHE GAVE HIM SOME REASON ANDTHAT IS WHAT MAKES IT SO ABOMINABLECOUPLING HER NAME WITH THIS YOUNGFELLOWS
MY DEAR CHETTAM IT WONT LEAD TO ANYTHING YOU KNOW SAID MR
BROOKE SEATING HIMSELF AND STICKING ON HIS EYEGLASS AGAIN
 ITS ALLOF A PIECE WITH CASAUBONS ODDITY
 THIS PAPER NOW SYNOPTICALTABULATION AND SO ON FOR THE USE OF MRS
 CASAUBON IT WAS LOCKED UPIN THE DESK WITH THE WILL
 I SUPPOSE HE MEANT DOROTHEA TO PUBLISH HISRESEARCHES EH
 AND SHELL DO IT YOU KNOW SHE HAS GONE INTO HISSTUDIES UNCOMMONLY
MY DEAR SIR SAID SIR JAMES IMPATIENTLY THAT IS NEITHER HERE NORTHERE
 THE QUESTION IS WHETHER YOU DONT SEE WITH ME THE PROPRIETY OFSENDING YOUNG LADISLAW AWAY
WELL NO NOT THE URGENCY OF THE THING
 BYANDBY PERHAPS IT MAYCOME ROUND
 AS TO GOSSIP YOU KNOW SENDING HIM AWAY WONT HINDERGOSSIP
 PEOPLE SAY WHAT THEY LIKE TO SAY NOT WHAT THEY HAVE CHAPTERAND VERSE FOR SAID MR BROOKE BECOMING ACUTE ABOUT THE TRUTHS THATLAY ON THE SIDE OF HIS OWN WISHES
 I MIGHT GET RID OF LADISLAW UP TO ACERTAIN POINTTAKE AWAY THE PIONEER FROM HIM AND THAT SORT OF THINGBUT I COULDNT SEND HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY IF HE DIDNT CHOOSE TOGODIDNT CHOOSE YOU KNOW
MR
 BROOKE PERSISTING AS QUIETLY AS IF HE WERE ONLY DISCUSSING THENATURE OF LAST YEARS WEATHER AND NODDING AT THE END WITH HIS USUALAMENITY WAS AN EXASPERATING FORM OF OBSTINACY
GOOD GOD
 SAID SIR JAMES WITH AS MUCH PASSION AS HE EVER SHOWEDLET US GET HIM A POST LET US SPEND MONEY ON HIM
 IF HE COULD GO INTHE SUITE OF SOME COLONIAL GOVERNOR
 GRAMPUS MIGHT TAKE HIMAND I COULDWRITE TO FULKE ABOUT IT
BUT LADISLAW WONT BE SHIPPED OFF LIKE A HEAD OF CATTLE MY DEARFELLOW LADISLAW HAS HIS IDEAS
 ITS MY OPINION THAT IF HE WERE TO PARTFROM ME TOMORROW YOUD ONLY HEAR THE MORE OF HIM IN THE COUNTRY
 WITHHIS TALENT FOR SPEAKING AND DRAWING UP DOCUMENTS THERE ARE FEW MEN WHOCOULD COME UP TO HIM AS AN AGITATORAN AGITATOR YOU KNOW
AGITATOR
 SAID SIR JAMES WITH BITTER EMPHASIS FEELING THAT THESYLLABLES OF THIS WORD PROPERLY REPEATED WERE A SUFFICIENT EXPOSURE OFITS HATEFULNESS
BUT BE REASONABLE CHETTAM
 DOROTHEA NOW
 AS YOU SAY SHE HAD BETTERGO TO CELIA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
 SHE CAN STAY UNDER YOUR ROOF AND INTHE MEAN TIME THINGS MAY COME ROUND QUIETLY
 DONT LET US BE FIRING OFFOUR GUNS IN A HURRY YOU KNOW
 STANDISH WILL KEEP OUR COUNSEL AND THENEWS WILL BE OLD BEFORE ITS KNOWN
 TWENTY THINGS MAY HAPPEN TO CARRYOFF LADISLAWWITHOUT MY DOING ANYTHING YOU KNOW
THEN I AM TO CONCLUDE THAT YOU DECLINE TO DO ANYTHING
DECLINE CHETTAM
NOI DIDNT SAY DECLINE
 BUT I REALLY DONT SEE WHATI COULD DO
 LADISLAW IS A GENTLEMAN
I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT
 SAID SIR JAMES HIS IRRITATION MAKING HIMFORGET HIMSELF A LITTLE
 I AM SURE CASAUBON WAS NOT
WELL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE IF HE HAD MADE THE CODICIL TO HINDERHER FROM MARRYING AGAIN AT ALL YOU KNOW
I DONT KNOW THAT SAID SIR JAMES
 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LESSINDELICATE
ONE OF POOR CASAUBONS FREAKS
 THAT ATTACK UPSET HIS BRAIN A LITTLE
IT ALL GOES FOR NOTHING
 SHE DOESNT WANT TO MARRY LADISLAW
BUT THIS CODICIL IS FRAMED SO AS TO MAKE EVERYBODY BELIEVE THAT SHEDID
 I DONT BELIEVE ANYTHING OF THE SORT ABOUT DOROTHEA SAID SIRJAMESTHEN FROWNINGLY BUT I SUSPECT LADISLAW
 I TELL YOU FRANKLY ISUSPECT LADISLAW
I COULDNT TAKE ANY IMMEDIATE ACTION ON THAT GROUND CHETTAM
 IN FACTIF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO PACK HIM OFFSEND HIM TO NORFOLK ISLANDTHATSORT OF THINGIT WOULD LOOK ALL THE WORSE FOR DOROTHEA TO THOSE WHOKNEW ABOUT IT
 IT WOULD SEEM AS IF WE DISTRUSTED HERDISTRUSTED HERYOU KNOW
THAT MR
 BROOKE HAD HIT ON AN UNDENIABLE ARGUMENT DID NOT TEND TOSOOTHE SIR JAMES
 HE PUT OUT HIS HAND TO REACH HIS HAT IMPLYING THATHE DID NOT MEAN TO CONTEND FURTHER AND SAID STILL WITH SOME HEATWELL I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I THINK DOROTHEA WAS SACRIFICED ONCEBECAUSE HER FRIENDS WERE TOO CARELESS
 I SHALL DO WHAT I CAN AS HERBROTHER TO PROTECT HER NOW
YOU CANT DO BETTER THAN GET HER TO FRESHITT AS SOON AS POSSIBLECHETTAM
 I APPROVE THAT PLAN ALTOGETHER SAID MR
 BROOKE WELL PLEASEDTHAT HE HAD WON THE ARGUMENT
 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHLY INCONVENIENT TOHIM TO PART WITH LADISLAW AT THAT TIME WHEN A DISSOLUTION MIGHT HAPPENANY DAY AND ELECTORS WERE TO BE CONVINCED OF THE COURSE BY WHICH THEINTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY WOULD BE BEST SERVED
 MR
 BROOKE SINCERELYBELIEVED THAT THIS END COULD BE SECURED BY HIS OWN RETURN TOPARLIAMENT HE OFFERED THE FORCES OF HIS MIND HONESTLY TO THE NATION

CANTERBURY TALES
DOROTHEA HAD BEEN SAFE AT FRESHITT HALL NEARLY A WEEK BEFORE SHE HADASKED ANY DANGEROUS QUESTIONS
 EVERY MORNING NOW SHE SAT WITH CELIA INTHE PRETTIEST OF UPSTAIRS SITTINGROOMS OPENING INTO A SMALLCONSERVATORYCELIA ALL IN WHITE AND LAVENDER LIKE A BUNCH OF MIXEDVIOLETS WATCHING THE REMARKABLE ACTS OF THE BABY WHICH WERE SODUBIOUS TO HER INEXPERIENCED MIND THAT ALL CONVERSATION WAS INTERRUPTEDBY APPEALS FOR THEIR INTERPRETATION MADE TO THE ORACULAR NURSE
DOROTHEA SAT BY IN HER WIDOWS DRESS WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH RATHERPROVOKED CELIA AS BEING MUCH TOO SAD FOR NOT ONLY WAS BABY QUITEWELL BUT REALLY WHEN A HUSBAND HAD BEEN SO DULL AND TROUBLESOME WHILEHE LIVED AND BESIDES THAT HADWELL WELL
 SIR JAMES OF COURSE HADTOLD CELIA EVERYTHING WITH A STRONG REPRESENTATION HOW IMPORTANT ITWAS THAT DOROTHEA SHOULD NOT KNOW IT SOONER THAN WAS INEVITABLE
BUT MR
 BROOKE HAD BEEN RIGHT IN PREDICTING THAT DOROTHEA WOULD NOTLONG REMAIN PASSIVE WHERE ACTION HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO HER SHE KNEW THEPURPORT OF HER HUSBANDS WILL MADE AT THE TIME OF THEIR MARRIAGE ANDHER MIND AS SOON AS SHE WAS CLEARLY CONSCIOUS OF HER POSITION WASSILENTLY OCCUPIED WITH WHAT SHE OUGHT TO DO AS THE OWNER OF LOWICKMANOR WITH THE PATRONAGE OF THE LIVING ATTACHED TO IT
ONE MORNING WHEN HER UNCLE PAID HIS USUAL VISIT THOUGH WITH AN UNUSUALALACRITY IN HIS MANNER WHICH HE ACCOUNTED FOR BY SAYING THAT IT WAS NOWPRETTY CERTAIN PARLIAMENT WOULD BE DISSOLVED FORTHWITH DOROTHEA SAIDUNCLE IT IS RIGHT NOW THAT I SHOULD CONSIDER WHO IS TO HAVE THELIVING AT LOWICK
 AFTER MR
 TUCKER HAD BEEN PROVIDED FOR I NEVER HEARDMY HUSBAND SAY THAT HE HAD ANY CLERGYMAN IN HIS MIND AS A SUCCESSOR TOHIMSELF
 I THINK I OUGHT TO HAVE THE KEYS NOW AND GO TO LOWICK TOEXAMINE ALL MY HUSBANDS PAPERS
 THERE MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WOULDTHROW LIGHT ON HIS WISHES
NO HURRY MY DEAR SAID MR
 BROOKE QUIETLY
 BYANDBY YOU KNOWYOU CAN GO IF YOU LIKE
 BUT I CAST MY EYES OVER THINGS IN THE DESKSAND DRAWERSTHERE WAS NOTHINGNOTHING BUT DEEP SUBJECTS YOUKNOWBESIDES THE WILL
 EVERYTHING CAN BE DONE BYANDBY
 AS TO THELIVING I HAVE HAD AN APPLICATION FOR INTEREST ALREADYI SHOULD SAYRATHER GOOD
 MR
 TYKE HAS BEEN STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO MEI HADSOMETHING TO DO WITH GETTING HIM AN APPOINTMENT BEFORE
 AN APOSTOLICMAN I BELIEVETHE SORT OF THING THAT WOULD SUIT YOU MY DEAR
I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE FULLER KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HIM UNCLE AND JUDGE FORMYSELF IF MR
 CASAUBON HAS NOT LEFT ANY EXPRESSION OF HIS WISHES
 HEHAS PERHAPS MADE SOME ADDITION TO HIS WILLTHERE MAY BE SOMEINSTRUCTIONS FOR ME SAID DOROTHEA WHO HAD ALL THE WHILE HAD THISCONJECTURE IN HER MIND WITH RELATION TO HER HUSBANDS WORK
NOTHING ABOUT THE RECTORY MY DEARNOTHING SAID MR
 BROOKE RISINGTO GO AWAY AND PUTTING OUT HIS HAND TO HIS NIECES NOR ABOUT HISRESEARCHES YOU KNOW
 NOTHING IN THE WILL
DOROTHEAS LIP QUIVERED
COME YOU MUST NOT THINK OF THESE THINGS YET MY DEAR
 BYANDBY YOUKNOW
I AM QUITE WELL NOW UNCLE I WISH TO EXERT MYSELF
WELL WELL WE SHALL SEE
 BUT I MUST RUN AWAY NOWI HAVE NO END OFWORK NOWITS A CRISISA POLITICAL CRISIS YOU KNOW
 AND HERE IS CELIAAND HER LITTLE MANYOU ARE AN AUNT YOU KNOW NOW AND I AM A SORT OFGRANDFATHER SAID MR
 BROOKE WITH PLACID HURRY ANXIOUS TO GET AWAYAND TELL CHETTAM THAT IT WOULD NOT BE HIS MR
 BROOKES FAULT IFDOROTHEA INSISTED ON LOOKING INTO EVERYTHING
DOROTHEA SANK BACK IN HER CHAIR WHEN HER UNCLE HAD LEFT THE ROOM ANDCAST HER EYES DOWN MEDITATIVELY ON HER CROSSED HANDS
LOOK DODO
 LOOK AT HIM
 DID YOU EVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE THAT
 SAIDCELIA IN HER COMFORTABLE STACCATO
WHAT KITTY
 SAID DOROTHEA LIFTING HER EYES RATHER ABSENTLY
WHAT
 WHY HIS UPPER LIP SEE HOW HE IS DRAWING IT DOWN AS IF HEMEANT TO MAKE A FACE
 ISNT IT WONDERFUL
 HE MAY HAVE HIS LITTLETHOUGHTS
 I WISH NURSE WERE HERE
 DO LOOK AT HIM
A LARGE TEAR WHICH HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME GATHERING ROLLED DOWNDOROTHEAS CHEEK AS SHE LOOKED UP AND TRIED TO SMILE
DONT BE SAD DODO KISS BABY
 WHAT ARE YOU BROODING OVER SO
 I AMSURE YOU DID EVERYTHING AND A GREAT DEAL TOO MUCH
 YOU SHOULD BE HAPPYNOW
I WONDER IF SIR JAMES WOULD DRIVE ME TO LOWICK
 I WANT TO LOOK OVEREVERYTHINGTO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY WORDS WRITTEN FOR ME
YOU ARE NOT TO GO TILL MR
 LYDGATE SAYS YOU MAY GO
 AND HE HAS NOTSAID SO YET HERE YOU ARE NURSE TAKE BABY AND WALK UP AND DOWN THEGALLERY
 BESIDES YOU HAVE GOT A WRONG NOTION IN YOUR HEAD AS USUALDODOI CAN SEE THAT IT VEXES ME
WHERE AM I WRONG KITTY
 SAID DOROTHEA QUITE MEEKLY
 SHE WAS ALMOSTREADY NOW TO THINK CELIA WISER THAN HERSELF AND WAS REALLY WONDERINGWITH SOME FEAR WHAT HER WRONG NOTION WAS
 CELIA FELT HER ADVANTAGE ANDWAS DETERMINED TO USE IT
 NONE OF THEM KNEW DODO AS WELL AS SHE DID ORKNEW HOW TO MANAGE HER
 SINCE CELIAS BABY WAS BORN SHE HAD HAD A NEWSENSE OF HER MENTAL SOLIDITY AND CALM WISDOM
 IT SEEMED CLEAR THATWHERE THERE WAS A BABY THINGS WERE RIGHT ENOUGH AND THAT ERROR INGENERAL WAS A MERE LACK OF THAT CENTRAL POISING FORCE
I CAN SEE WHAT YOU ARE THINKING OF AS WELL AS CAN BE DODO SAIDCELIA
 YOU ARE WANTING TO FIND OUT IF THERE IS ANYTHING UNCOMFORTABLEFOR YOU TO DO NOW ONLY BECAUSE MR
 CASAUBON WISHED IT
 AS IF YOU HADNOT BEEN UNCOMFORTABLE ENOUGH BEFORE
 AND HE DOESNT DESERVE IT ANDYOU WILL FIND THAT OUT
 HE HAS BEHAVED VERY BADLY
 JAMES IS AS ANGRYWITH HIM AS CAN BE
 AND I HAD BETTER TELL YOU TO PREPARE YOU
CELIA SAID DOROTHEA ENTREATINGLY YOU DISTRESS ME
 TELL ME AT ONCEWHAT YOU MEAN
 IT GLANCED THROUGH HER MIND THAT MR
 CASAUBON HAD LEFTTHE PROPERTY AWAY FROM HERWHICH WOULD NOT BE SO VERY DISTRESSING
WHY HE HAS MADE A CODICIL TO HIS WILL TO SAY THE PROPERTY WAS ALL TOGO AWAY FROM YOU IF YOU MARRIEDI MEANTHAT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE SAID DOROTHEA BREAKING IN IMPETUOUSLY
BUT IF YOU MARRIED MR
 LADISLAW NOT ANYBODY ELSE CELIA WENT ON WITHPERSEVERING QUIETUDE
 OF COURSE THAT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE IN ONEWAYYOU NEVER WOULD MARRY MR
 LADISLAW BUT THAT ONLY MAKES IT WORSEOF MR
 CASAUBON
THE BLOOD RUSHED TO DOROTHEAS FACE AND NECK PAINFULLY
 BUT CELIA WASADMINISTERING WHAT SHE THOUGHT A SOBERING DOSE OF FACT
 IT WAS TAKINGUP NOTIONS THAT HAD DONE DODOS HEALTH SO MUCH HARM
 SO SHE WENT ON INHER NEUTRAL TONE AS IF SHE HAD BEEN REMARKING ON BABYS ROBES
JAMES SAYS SO
 HE SAYS IT IS ABOMINABLE AND NOT LIKE A GENTLEMAN
 ANDTHERE NEVER WAS A BETTER JUDGE THAN JAMES
 IT IS AS IF MR
 CASAUBONWANTED TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULD WISH TO MARRY MR
LADISLAWWHICH IS RIDICULOUS
 ONLY JAMES SAYS IT WAS TO HINDER MR
LADISLAW FROM WANTING TO MARRY YOU FOR YOUR MONEYJUST AS IF HE EVERWOULD THINK OF MAKING YOU AN OFFER
 MRS
 CADWALLADER SAID YOU MIGHT ASWELL MARRY AN ITALIAN WITH WHITE MICE
 BUT I MUST JUST GO AND LOOK ATBABY CELIA ADDED WITHOUT THE LEAST CHANGE OF TONE THROWING A LIGHTSHAWL OVER HER AND TRIPPING AWAY
DOROTHEA BY THIS TIME HAD TURNED COLD AGAIN AND NOW THREW HERSELF BACKHELPLESSLY IN HER CHAIR
 SHE MIGHT HAVE COMPARED HER EXPERIENCE AT THATMOMENT TO THE VAGUE ALARMED CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HER LIFE WAS TAKING ONA NEW FORM THAT SHE WAS UNDERGOING A METAMORPHOSIS IN WHICH MEMORYWOULD NOT ADJUST ITSELF TO THE STIRRING OF NEW ORGANS
 EVERYTHING WASCHANGING ITS ASPECT HER HUSBANDS CONDUCT HER OWN DUTEOUS FEELINGTOWARDS HIM EVERY STRUGGLE BETWEEN THEMAND YET MORE HER WHOLERELATION TO WILL LADISLAW
 HER WORLD WAS IN A STATE OF CONVULSIVECHANGE THE ONLY THING SHE COULD SAY DISTINCTLY TO HERSELF WAS THATSHE MUST WAIT AND THINK ANEW
 ONE CHANGE TERRIFIED HER AS IF IT HADBEEN A SIN IT WAS A VIOLENT SHOCK OF REPULSION FROM HER DEPARTEDHUSBAND WHO HAD HAD HIDDEN THOUGHTS PERHAPS PERVERTING EVERYTHING SHESAID AND DID
 THEN AGAIN SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF ANOTHER CHANGE WHICH ALSOMADE HER TREMULOUS IT WAS A SUDDEN STRANGE YEARNING OF HEART TOWARDSWILL LADISLAW
 IT HAD NEVER BEFORE ENTERED HER MIND THAT HE COULDUNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BE HER LOVER CONCEIVE THE EFFECT OF THESUDDEN REVELATION THAT ANOTHER HAD THOUGHT OF HIM IN THAT LIGHTTHATPERHAPS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF SUCH A POSSIBILITYAND THISWITH THE HURRYING CROWDING VISION OF UNFITTING CONDITIONS ANDQUESTIONS NOT SOON TO BE SOLVED
IT SEEMED A LONG WHILESHE DID NOT KNOW HOW LONGBEFORE SHE HEARD CELIASAYING THAT WILL DO NURSE HE WILL BE QUIET ON MY LAP NOW
 YOU CANGO TO LUNCH AND LET GARRATT STAY IN THE NEXT ROOM
 WHAT I THINKDODO CELIA WENT ON OBSERVING NOTHING MORE THAN THAT DOROTHEA WASLEANING BACK IN HER CHAIR AND LIKELY TO BE PASSIVE IS THAT MR
CASAUBON WAS SPITEFUL
 I NEVER DID LIKE HIM AND JAMES NEVER DID
 ITHINK THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH WERE DREADFULLY SPITEFUL
 AND NOW HE HASBEHAVED IN THIS WAY I AM SURE RELIGION DOES NOT REQUIRE YOU TO MAKEYOURSELF UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT HIM
 IF HE HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY THAT IS AMERCY AND YOU OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL
 WE SHOULD NOT GRIEVE SHOULD WEBABY
 SAID CELIA CONFIDENTIALLY TO THAT UNCONSCIOUS CENTRE AND POISEOF THE WORLD WHO HAD THE MOST REMARKABLE FISTS ALL COMPLETE EVEN TOTHE NAILS AND HAIR ENOUGH REALLY WHEN YOU TOOK HIS CAP OFF TOMAKEYOU DIDNT KNOW WHATIN SHORT HE WAS BOUDDHA IN A WESTERN FORM
AT THIS CRISIS LYDGATE WAS ANNOUNCED AND ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HESAID WAS I FEAR YOU ARE NOT SO WELL AS YOU WERE MRS
 CASAUBON HAVEYOU BEEN AGITATED
 ALLOW ME TO FEEL YOUR PULSE
 DOROTHEAS HAND WAS OFA MARBLE COLDNESS
SHE WANTS TO GO TO LOWICK TO LOOK OVER PAPERS SAID CELIA
 SHEOUGHT NOT OUGHT SHE
LYDGATE DID NOT SPEAK FOR A FEW MOMENTS
 THEN HE SAID LOOKING ATDOROTHEA
 I HARDLY KNOW
 IN MY OPINION MRS
 CASAUBON SHOULD DO WHATWOULD GIVE HER THE MOST REPOSE OF MIND
 THAT REPOSE WILL NOT ALWAYSCOME FROM BEING FORBIDDEN TO ACT
THANK YOU SAID DOROTHEA EXERTING HERSELF I AM SURE THAT IS WISE
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WHICH I OUGHT TO ATTEND TO
 WHY SHOULD I SITHERE IDLE
 THEN WITH AN EFFORT TO RECALL SUBJECTS NOT CONNECTED WITHHER AGITATION SHE ADDED ABRUPTLY YOU KNOW EVERY ONE IN MIDDLEMARCHI THINK MR
 LYDGATE
 I SHALL ASK YOU TO TELL ME A GREAT DEAL
 I HAVESERIOUS THINGS TO DO NOW
 I HAVE A LIVING TO GIVE AWAY
 YOU KNOW MR
TYKE AND ALL THE BUT DOROTHEAS EFFORT WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER SHEBROKE OFF AND BURST INTO SOBS
LYDGATE MADE HER DRINK A DOSE OF SAL VOLATILE
LET MRS
 CASAUBON DO AS SHE LIKES HE SAID TO SIR JAMES WHOM HEASKED TO SEE BEFORE QUITTING THE HOUSE
 SHE WANTS PERFECT FREEDOM ITHINK MORE THAN ANY OTHER PRESCRIPTION
HIS ATTENDANCE ON DOROTHEA WHILE HER BRAIN WAS EXCITED HAD ENABLED HIMTO FORM SOME TRUE CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING THE TRIALS OF HER LIFE
 HEFELT SURE THAT SHE HAD BEEN SUFFERING FROM THE STRAIN AND CONFLICT OFSELFREPRESSION AND THAT SHE WAS LIKELY NOW TO FEEL HERSELF ONLY INANOTHER SORT OF PINFOLD THAN THAT FROM WHICH SHE HAD BEEN RELEASED
LYDGATES ADVICE WAS ALL THE EASIER FOR SIR JAMES TO FOLLOW WHEN HEFOUND THAT CELIA HAD ALREADY TOLD DOROTHEA THE UNPLEASANT FACT ABOUTTHE WILL
 THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT NOWNO REASON FOR ANY FURTHER DELAYIN THE EXECUTION OF NECESSARY BUSINESS
 AND THE NEXT DAY SIR JAMESCOMPLIED AT ONCE WITH HER REQUEST THAT HE WOULD DRIVE HER TO LOWICK
I HAVE NO WISH TO STAY THERE AT PRESENT SAID DOROTHEA I COULDHARDLY BEAR IT
 I AM MUCH HAPPIER AT FRESHITT WITH CELIA
 I SHALL BEABLE TO THINK BETTER ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE AT LOWICK BY LOOKING ATIT FROM A DISTANCE
 AND I SHOULD LIKE TO BE AT THE GRANGE A LITTLEWHILE WITH MY UNCLE AND GO ABOUT IN ALL THE OLD WALKS AND AMONG THEPEOPLE IN THE VILLAGE
NOT YET I THINK
 YOUR UNCLE IS HAVING POLITICAL COMPANY AND YOU AREBETTER OUT OF THE WAY OF SUCH DOINGS SAID SIR JAMES WHO AT THATMOMENT THOUGHT OF THE GRANGE CHIEFLY AS A HAUNT OF YOUNG LADISLAWS
BUT NO WORD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND DOROTHEA ABOUT THE OBJECTIONABLEPART OF THE WILL INDEED BOTH OF THEM FELT THAT THE MENTION OF ITBETWEEN THEM WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
 SIR JAMES WAS SHY EVEN WITH MENABOUT DISAGREEABLE SUBJECTS AND THE ONE THING THAT DOROTHEA WOULD HAVECHOSEN TO SAY IF SHE HAD SPOKEN ON THE MATTER AT ALL WAS FORBIDDEN TOHER AT PRESENT BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO BE A FURTHER EXPOSURE OF HERHUSBANDS INJUSTICE
 YET SHE DID WISH THAT SIR JAMES COULD KNOW WHATHAD PASSED BETWEEN HER AND HER HUSBAND ABOUT WILL LADISLAWS MORALCLAIM ON THE PROPERTY IT WOULD THEN SHE THOUGHT BE APPARENT TO HIMAS IT WAS TO HER THAT HER HUSBANDS STRANGE INDELICATE PROVISO HADBEEN CHIEFLY URGED BY HIS BITTER RESISTANCE TO THAT IDEA OF CLAIM ANDNOT MERELY BY PERSONAL FEELINGS MORE DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT
 ALSO ITMUST BE ADMITTED DOROTHEA WISHED THAT THIS COULD BE KNOWN FOR WILLSSAKE SINCE HER FRIENDS SEEMED TO THINK OF HIM AS SIMPLY AN OBJECT OFMR
 CASAUBONS CHARITY
 WHY SHOULD HE BE COMPARED WITH AN ITALIANCARRYING WHITE MICE
 THAT WORD QUOTED FROM MRS
 CADWALLADER SEEMED LIKEA MOCKING TRAVESTY WROUGHT IN THE DARK BY AN IMPISH FINGER
AT LOWICK DOROTHEA SEARCHED DESK AND DRAWERSEARCHED ALL HER HUSBANDSPLACES OF DEPOSIT FOR PRIVATE WRITING BUT FOUND NO PAPER ADDRESSEDESPECIALLY TO HER EXCEPT THAT SYNOPTICAL TABULATION WHICH WASPROBABLY ONLY THE BEGINNING OF MANY INTENDED DIRECTIONS FOR HERGUIDANCE
 IN CARRYING OUT THIS BEQUEST OF LABOR TO DOROTHEA AS IN ALLELSE MR
 CASAUBON HAD BEEN SLOW AND HESITATING OPPRESSED IN THE PLANOF TRANSMITTING HIS WORK AS HE HAD BEEN IN EXECUTING IT BY THE SENSEOF MOVING HEAVILY IN A DIM AND CLOGGING MEDIUM DISTRUST OF DOROTHEASCOMPETENCE TO ARRANGE WHAT HE HAD PREPARED WAS SUBDUED ONLY BY DISTRUSTOF ANY OTHER REDACTOR
 BUT HE HAD COME AT LAST TO CREATE A TRUST FORHIMSELF OUT OF DOROTHEAS NATURE SHE COULD DO WHAT SHE RESOLVED TO DOAND HE WILLINGLY IMAGINED HER TOILING UNDER THE FETTERS OF A PROMISE TOERECT A TOMB WITH HIS NAME UPON IT
 NOT THAT MR
 CASAUBON CALLED THEFUTURE VOLUMES A TOMB HE CALLED THEM THE KEY TO ALL MYTHOLOGIES
 BUTTHE MONTHS GAINED ON HIM AND LEFT HIS PLANS BELATED HE HAD ONLY HADTIME TO ASK FOR THAT PROMISE BY WHICH HE SOUGHT TO KEEP HIS COLD GRASPON DOROTHEAS LIFE
THE GRASP HAD SLIPPED AWAY
 BOUND BY A PLEDGE GIVEN FROM THE DEPTHS OFHER PITY SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF UNDERTAKING A TOIL WHICH HERJUDGMENT WHISPERED WAS VAIN FOR ALL USES EXCEPT THAT CONSECRATION OFFAITHFULNESS WHICH IS A SUPREME USE
 BUT NOW HER JUDGMENT INSTEAD OFBEING CONTROLLED BY DUTEOUS DEVOTION WAS MADE ACTIVE BY THEIMBITTERING DISCOVERY THAT IN HER PAST UNION THERE HAD LURKED THEHIDDEN ALIENATION OF SECRECY AND SUSPICION
 THE LIVING SUFFERING MANWAS NO LONGER BEFORE HER TO AWAKEN HER PITY THERE REMAINED ONLY THERETROSPECT OF PAINFUL SUBJECTION TO A HUSBAND WHOSE THOUGHTS HAD BEENLOWER THAN SHE HAD BELIEVED WHOSE EXORBITANT CLAIMS FOR HIMSELF HADEVEN BLINDED HIS SCRUPULOUS CARE FOR HIS OWN CHARACTER AND MADE HIMDEFEAT HIS OWN PRIDE BY SHOCKING MEN OF ORDINARY HONOR
 AS FOR THEPROPERTY WHICH WAS THE SIGN OF THAT BROKEN TIE SHE WOULD HAVE BEENGLAD TO BE FREE FROM IT AND HAVE NOTHING MORE THAN HER ORIGINAL FORTUNEWHICH HAD BEEN SETTLED ON HER IF THERE HAD NOT BEEN DUTIES ATTACHED TOOWNERSHIP WHICH SHE OUGHT NOT TO FLINCH FROM
 ABOUT THIS PROPERTY MANYTROUBLOUS QUESTIONS INSISTED ON RISING HAD SHE NOT BEEN RIGHT INTHINKING THAT THE HALF OF IT OUGHT TO GO TO WILL LADISLAW
BUT WAS ITNOT IMPOSSIBLE NOW FOR HER TO DO THAT ACT OF JUSTICE
 MR
 CASAUBON HADTAKEN A CRUELLY EFFECTIVE MEANS OF HINDERING HER EVEN WITH INDIGNATIONAGAINST HIM IN HER HEART ANY ACT THAT SEEMED A TRIUMPHANT ELUDING OFHIS PURPOSE REVOLTED HER
AFTER COLLECTING PAPERS OF BUSINESS WHICH SHE WISHED TO EXAMINE SHELOCKED UP AGAIN THE DESKS AND DRAWERSALL EMPTY OF PERSONAL WORDS FORHEREMPTY OF ANY SIGN THAT IN HER HUSBANDS LONELY BROODING HIS HEARTHAD GONE OUT TO HER IN EXCUSE OR EXPLANATION AND SHE WENT BACK TOFRESHITT WITH THE SENSE THAT AROUND HIS LAST HARD DEMAND AND HIS LASTINJURIOUS ASSERTION OF HIS POWER THE SILENCE WAS UNBROKEN
DOROTHEA TRIED NOW TO TURN HER THOUGHTS TOWARDS IMMEDIATE DUTIES ANDONE OF THESE WAS OF A KIND WHICH OTHERS WERE DETERMINED TO REMIND HEROF
 LYDGATES EAR HAD CAUGHT EAGERLY HER MENTION OF THE LIVING AND ASSOON AS HE COULD HE REOPENED THE SUBJECT SEEING HERE A POSSIBILITY OFMAKING AMENDS FOR THE CASTINGVOTE HE HAD ONCE GIVEN WITH ANILLSATISFIED CONSCIENCE
 INSTEAD OF TELLING YOU ANYTHING ABOUT MR
TYKE HE SAID I SHOULD LIKE TO SPEAK OF ANOTHER MANMR
 FAREBROTHERTHE VICAR OF ST
 BOTOLPHS
 HIS LIVING IS A POOR ONE AND GIVES HIM ASTINTED PROVISION FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
 HIS MOTHER AUNT ANDSISTER ALL LIVE WITH HIM AND DEPEND UPON HIM
 I BELIEVE HE HAS NEVERMARRIED BECAUSE OF THEM
 I NEVER HEARD SUCH GOOD PREACHING AS HISSUCHPLAIN EASY ELOQUENCE
 HE WOULD HAVE DONE TO PREACH AT ST
 PAULS CROSSAFTER OLD LATIMER
 HIS TALK IS JUST AS GOOD ABOUT ALL SUBJECTSORIGINAL SIMPLE CLEAR
 I THINK HIM A REMARKABLE FELLOW HE OUGHT TOHAVE DONE MORE THAN HE HAS DONE
WHY HAS HE NOT DONE MORE
 SAID DOROTHEA INTERESTED NOW IN ALL WHOHAD SLIPPED BELOW THEIR OWN INTENTION
THATS A HARD QUESTION SAID LYDGATE
 I FIND MYSELF THAT ITSUNCOMMONLY DIFFICULT TO MAKE THE RIGHT THING WORK THERE ARE SO MANYSTRINGS PULLING AT ONCE
 FAREBROTHER OFTEN HINTS THAT HE HAS GOT INTOTHE WRONG PROFESSION HE WANTS A WIDER RANGE THAN THAT OF A POORCLERGYMAN AND I SUPPOSE HE HAS NO INTEREST TO HELP HIM ON
 HE IS VERYFOND OF NATURAL HISTORY AND VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC MATTERS AND HE ISHAMPERED IN RECONCILING THESE TASTES WITH HIS POSITION
 HE HAS NO MONEYTO SPAREHARDLY ENOUGH TO USE AND THAT HAS LED HIM INTOCARDPLAYINGMIDDLEMARCH IS A GREAT PLACE FOR WHIST
 HE DOES PLAY FORMONEY AND HE WINS A GOOD DEAL
 OF COURSE THAT TAKES HIM INTO COMPANY ALITTLE BENEATH HIM AND MAKES HIM SLACK ABOUT SOME THINGS AND YETWITH ALL THAT LOOKING AT HIM AS A WHOLE I THINK HE IS ONE OF THE MOSTBLAMELESS MEN I EVER KNEW
 HE HAS NEITHER VENOM NOR DOUBLENESS IN HIMAND THOSE OFTEN GO WITH A MORE CORRECT OUTSIDE
I WONDER WHETHER HE SUFFERS IN HIS CONSCIENCE BECAUSE OF THAT HABITSAID DOROTHEA I WONDER WHETHER HE WISHES HE COULD LEAVE IT OFF
I HAVE NO DOUBT HE WOULD LEAVE IT OFF IF HE WERE TRANSPLANTED INTOPLENTY HE WOULD BE GLAD OF THE TIME FOR OTHER THINGS
MY UNCLE SAYS THAT MR
 TYKE IS SPOKEN OF AS AN APOSTOLIC MAN SAIDDOROTHEA MEDITATIVELY
 SHE WAS WISHING IT WERE POSSIBLE TO RESTORE THETIMES OF PRIMITIVE ZEAL AND YET THINKING OF MR
 FAREBROTHER WITH ASTRONG DESIRE TO RESCUE HIM FROM HIS CHANCEGOTTEN MONEY
I DONT PRETEND TO SAY THAT FAREBROTHER IS APOSTOLIC SAID LYDGATE
HIS POSITION IS NOT QUITE LIKE THAT OF THE APOSTLES HE IS ONLY APARSON AMONG PARISHIONERS WHOSE LIVES HE HAS TO TRY AND MAKE BETTER
PRACTICALLY I FIND THAT WHAT IS CALLED BEING APOSTOLIC NOW IS ANIMPATIENCE OF EVERYTHING IN WHICH THE PARSON DOESNT CUT THE PRINCIPALFIGURE
 I SEE SOMETHING OF THAT IN MR
 TYKE AT THE HOSPITAL A GOODDEAL OF HIS DOCTRINE IS A SORT OF PINCHING HARD TO MAKE PEOPLEUNCOMFORTABLY AWARE OF HIM
 BESIDES AN APOSTOLIC MAN AT LOWICK
HEOUGHT TO THINK AS ST
 FRANCIS DID THAT IT IS NEEDFUL TO PREACH TO THEBIRDS
TRUE SAID DOROTHEA
 IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT SORT OF NOTIONS OURFARMERS AND LABORERS GET FROM THEIR TEACHING
 I HAVE BEEN LOOKING INTOA VOLUME OF SERMONS BY MR
 TYKE SUCH SERMONS WOULD BE OF NO USE ATLOWICKI MEAN ABOUT IMPUTED RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE PROPHECIES IN THEAPOCALYPSE
 I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THINKING OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICHCHRISTIANITY IS TAUGHT AND WHENEVER I FIND ONE WAY THAT MAKES IT AWIDER BLESSING THAN ANY OTHER I CLING TO THAT AS THE TRUESTI MEANTHAT WHICH TAKES IN THE MOST GOOD OF ALL KINDS AND BRINGS IN THE MOSTPEOPLE AS SHARERS IN IT
 IT IS SURELY BETTER TO PARDON TOO MUCH THANTO CONDEMN TOO MUCH
 BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MR
 FAREBROTHER AND HEARHIM PREACH
DO SAID LYDGATE I TRUST TO THE EFFECT OF THAT
 HE IS VERY MUCHBELOVED BUT HE HAS HIS ENEMIES TOO THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE WHO CANTFORGIVE AN ABLE MAN FOR DIFFERING FROM THEM
 AND THAT MONEYWINNINGBUSINESS IS REALLY A BLOT
 YOU DONT OF COURSE SEE MANY MIDDLEMARCHPEOPLE BUT MR
 LADISLAW WHO IS CONSTANTLY SEEING MR
 BROOKE IS AGREAT FRIEND OF MR
 FAREBROTHERS OLD LADIES AND WOULD BE GLAD TO SINGTHE VICARS PRAISES
 ONE OF THE OLD LADIESMISS NOBLE THE AUNTIS AWONDERFULLY QUAINT PICTURE OF SELFFORGETFUL GOODNESS AND LADISLAWGALLANTS HER ABOUT SOMETIMES
 I MET THEM ONE DAY IN A BACK STREET YOUKNOW LADISLAWS LOOKA SORT OF DAPHNIS IN COAT AND WAISTCOAT AND THISLITTLE OLD MAID REACHING UP TO HIS ARMTHEY LOOKED LIKE A COUPLEDROPPED OUT OF A ROMANTIC COMEDY
 BUT THE BEST EVIDENCE ABOUTFAREBROTHER IS TO SEE HIM AND HEAR HIM
HAPPILY DOROTHEA WAS IN HER PRIVATE SITTINGROOM WHEN THIS CONVERSATIONOCCURRED AND THERE WAS NO ONE PRESENT TO MAKE LYDGATES INNOCENTINTRODUCTION OF LADISLAW PAINFUL TO HER
 AS WAS USUAL WITH HIM INMATTERS OF PERSONAL GOSSIP LYDGATE HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN ROSAMONDSREMARK THAT SHE THOUGHT WILL ADORED MRS
 CASAUBON
 AT THAT MOMENT HEWAS ONLY CARING FOR WHAT WOULD RECOMMEND THE FAREBROTHER FAMILY AND HEHAD PURPOSELY GIVEN EMPHASIS TO THE WORST THAT COULD BE SAID ABOUT THEVICAR IN ORDER TO FORESTALL OBJECTIONS
 IN THE WEEKS SINCE MR
CASAUBONS DEATH HE HAD HARDLY SEEN LADISLAW AND HE HAD HEARD NO RUMORTO WARN HIM THAT MR
 BROOKES CONFIDENTIAL SECRETARY WAS A DANGEROUSSUBJECT WITH MRS
 CASAUBON
 WHEN HE WAS GONE HIS PICTURE OF LADISLAWLINGERED IN HER MIND AND DISPUTED THE GROUND WITH THAT QUESTION OF THELOWICK LIVING
 WHAT WAS WILL LADISLAW THINKING ABOUT HER
 WOULD HE HEAROF THAT FACT WHICH MADE HER CHEEKS BURN AS THEY NEVER USED TO DO
 ANDHOW WOULD HE FEEL WHEN HE HEARD IT
BUT SHE COULD SEE AS WELL ASPOSSIBLE HOW HE SMILED DOWN AT THE LITTLE OLD MAID
 AN ITALIAN WITHWHITE MICE
ON THE CONTRARY HE WAS A CREATURE WHO ENTERED INTO EVERYONES FEELINGS AND COULD TAKE THE PRESSURE OF THEIR THOUGHT INSTEAD OFURGING HIS OWN WITH IRON RESISTANCE
CHAPTER LI
PARTY IS NATURE TOO AND YOU SHALL SEEBY FORCE OF LOGIC HOW THEY BOTH AGREETHE MANY IN THE ONE THE ONE IN MANYALL IS NOT SOME NOR SOME THE SAME AS ANYGENUS HOLDS SPECIES BOTH ARE GREAT OR SMALLONE GENUS HIGHEST ONE NOT HIGH AT ALLEACH SPECIES HAS ITS DIFFERENTIA TOOTHIS IS NOT THAT AND HE WAS NEVER YOUTHOUGH THIS AND THAT ARE AYES AND YOU AND HEARE LIKE AS ONE TO ONE OR THREE TO THREE
NO GOSSIP ABOUT MR
 CASAUBONS WILL HAD YET REACHED LADISLAW THE AIRSEEMED TO BE FILLED WITH THE DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT AND THE COMINGELECTION AS THE OLD WAKES AND FAIRS WERE FILLED WITH THE RIVAL CLATTEROF ITINERANT SHOWS AND MORE PRIVATE NOISES WERE TAKEN LITTLE NOTICEOF
 THE FAMOUS DRY ELECTION WAS AT HAND IN WHICH THE DEPTHS OFPUBLIC FEELING MIGHT BE MEASURED BY THE LOW FLOODMARK OF DRINK
 WILLLADISLAW WAS ONE OF THE BUSIEST AT THIS TIME AND THOUGH DOROTHEASWIDOWHOOD WAS CONTINUALLY IN HIS THOUGHT HE WAS SO FAR FROM WISHING TOBE SPOKEN TO ON THE SUBJECT THAT WHEN LYDGATE SOUGHT HIM OUT TO TELLHIM WHAT HAD PASSED ABOUT THE LOWICK LIVING HE ANSWERED RATHERWASPISHLYWHY SHOULD YOU BRING ME INTO THE MATTER
 I NEVER SEE MRS
 CASAUBONAND AM NOT LIKELY TO SEE HER SINCE SHE IS AT FRESHITT
 I NEVER GOTHERE
 IT IS TORY GROUND WHERE I AND THE PIONEER ARE NO MORE WELCOMETHAN A POACHER AND HIS GUN
THE FACT WAS THAT WILL HAD BEEN MADE THE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE BY OBSERVINGTHAT MR
 BROOKE INSTEAD OF WISHING HIM AS BEFORE TO COME TO THEGRANGE OFTENER THAN WAS QUITE AGREEABLE TO HIMSELF SEEMED NOW TOCONTRIVE THAT HE SHOULD GO THERE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE
 THIS WAS ASHUFFLING CONCESSION OF MR
 BROOKES TO SIR JAMES CHETTAMS INDIGNANTREMONSTRANCE AND WILL AWAKE TO THE SLIGHTEST HINT IN THIS DIRECTIONCONCLUDED THAT HE WAS TO BE KEPT AWAY FROM THE GRANGE ON DOROTHEASACCOUNT
 HER FRIENDS THEN REGARDED HIM WITH SOME SUSPICION
 THEIRFEARS WERE QUITE SUPERFLUOUS THEY WERE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN IF THEYIMAGINED THAT HE WOULD PUT HIMSELF FORWARD AS A NEEDY ADVENTURER TRYINGTO WIN THE FAVOR OF A RICH WOMAN
UNTIL NOW WILL HAD NEVER FULLY SEEN THE CHASM BETWEEN HIMSELF ANDDOROTHEAUNTIL NOW THAT HE WAS COME TO THE BRINK OF IT AND SAW HER ONTHE OTHER SIDE
 HE BEGAN NOT WITHOUT SOME INWARD RAGE TO THINK OFGOING AWAY FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TOSHOW ANY FURTHER INTEREST IN DOROTHEA WITHOUT SUBJECTING HIMSELF TODISAGREEABLE IMPUTATIONSPERHAPS EVEN IN HER MIND WHICH OTHERS MIGHTTRY TO POISON
WE ARE FOREVER DIVIDED SAID WILL
 I MIGHT AS WELL BE AT ROME SHEWOULD BE NO FARTHER FROM ME
 BUT WHAT WE CALL OUR DESPAIR IS OFTENONLY THE PAINFUL EAGERNESS OF UNFED HOPE
 THERE WERE PLENTY OF REASONSWHY HE SHOULD NOT GOPUBLIC REASONS WHY HE SHOULD NOT QUIT HIS POST ATTHIS CRISIS LEAVING MR
 BROOKE IN THE LURCH WHEN HE NEEDED COACHINGFOR THE ELECTION AND WHEN THERE WAS SO MUCH CANVASSING DIRECT ANDINDIRECT TO BE CARRIED ON
 WILL COULD NOT LIKE TO LEAVE HIS OWNCHESSMEN IN THE HEAT OF A GAME AND ANY CANDIDATE ON THE RIGHT SIDEEVEN IF HIS BRAIN AND MARROW HAD BEEN AS SOFT AS WAS CONSISTENT WITH AGENTLEMANLY BEARING MIGHT HELP TO TURN A MAJORITY
 TO COACH MR
 BROOKEAND KEEP HIM STEADILY TO THE IDEA THAT HE MUST PLEDGE HIMSELF TO VOTEFOR THE ACTUAL REFORM BILL INSTEAD OF INSISTING ON HIS INDEPENDENCEAND POWER OF PULLING UP IN TIME WAS NOT AN EASY TASK
 MR
FAREBROTHERS PROPHECY OF A FOURTH CANDIDATE IN THE BAG HAD NOT YETBEEN FULFILLED NEITHER THE PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATE SOCIETY NOR ANYOTHER POWER ON THE WATCH TO SECURE A REFORMING MAJORITY SEEING A WORTHYNODUS FOR INTERFERENCE WHILE THERE WAS A SECOND REFORMING CANDIDATELIKE MR
 BROOKE WHO MIGHT BE RETURNED AT HIS OWN EXPENSE AND THEFIGHT LAY ENTIRELY BETWEEN PINKERTON THE OLD TORY MEMBER BAGSTER THENEW WHIG MEMBER RETURNED AT THE LAST ELECTION AND BROOKE THE FUTUREINDEPENDENT MEMBER WHO WAS TO FETTER HIMSELF FOR THIS OCCASION ONLY
MR
 HAWLEY AND HIS PARTY WOULD BEND ALL THEIR FORCES TO THE RETURN OFPINKERTON AND MR
 BROOKES SUCCESS MUST DEPEND EITHER ON PLUMPERSWHICH WOULD LEAVE BAGSTER IN THE REAR OR ON THE NEW MINTING OF TORYVOTES INTO REFORMING VOTES
 THE LATTER MEANS OF COURSE WOULD BEPREFERABLE
THIS PROSPECT OF CONVERTING VOTES WAS A DANGEROUS DISTRACTION TO MR
BROOKE HIS IMPRESSION THAT WAVERERS WERE LIKELY TO BE ALLURED BYWAVERING STATEMENTS AND ALSO THE LIABILITY OF HIS MIND TO STICK AFRESHAT OPPOSING ARGUMENTS AS THEY TURNED UP IN HIS MEMORY GAVE WILLLADISLAW MUCH TROUBLE
YOU KNOW THERE ARE TACTICS IN THESE THINGS SAID MR
 BROOKE MEETINGPEOPLE HALFWAYTEMPERING YOUR IDEASSAYING WELL NOW THERESSOMETHING IN THAT AND SO ON
 I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THIS IS A PECULIAROCCASIONTHE COUNTRY WITH A WILL OF ITS OWNPOLITICAL UNIONSTHAT SORTOF THINGBUT WE SOMETIMES CUT WITH RATHER TOO SHARP A KNIFE LADISLAW
THESE TENPOUND HOUSEHOLDERS NOW WHY TEN
 DRAW THE LINESOMEWHEREYES BUT WHY JUST AT TEN
 THATS A DIFFICULT QUESTION NOWIF YOU GO INTO IT
OF COURSE IT IS SAID WILL IMPATIENTLY
 BUT IF YOU ARE TO WAIT TILLWE GET A LOGICAL BILL YOU MUST PUT YOURSELF FORWARD AS AREVOLUTIONIST AND THEN MIDDLEMARCH WOULD NOT ELECT YOU I FANCY
 ASFOR TRIMMING THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR TRIMMING
MR
 BROOKE ALWAYS ENDED BY AGREEING WITH LADISLAW WHO STILL APPEAREDTO HIM A SORT OF BURKE WITH A LEAVEN OF SHELLEY BUT AFTER AN INTERVALTHE WISDOM OF HIS OWN METHODS REASSERTED ITSELF AND HE WAS AGAIN DRAWNINTO USING THEM WITH MUCH HOPEFULNESS
 AT THIS STAGE OF AFFAIRS HE WASIN EXCELLENT SPIRITS WHICH EVEN SUPPORTED HIM UNDER LARGE ADVANCES OFMONEY FOR HIS POWERS OF CONVINCING AND PERSUADING HAD NOT YET BEENTESTED BY ANYTHING MORE DIFFICULT THAN A CHAIRMANS SPEECH INTRODUCINGOTHER ORATORS OR A DIALOGUE WITH A MIDDLEMARCH VOTER FROM WHICH HECAME AWAY WITH A SENSE THAT HE WAS A TACTICIAN BY NATURE AND THAT ITWAS A PITY HE HAD NOT GONE EARLIER INTO THIS KIND OF THING
 HE WAS ALITTLE CONSCIOUS OF DEFEAT HOWEVER WITH MR
 MAWMSEY A CHIEFREPRESENTATIVE IN MIDDLEMARCH OF THAT GREAT SOCIAL POWER THE RETAILTRADER AND NATURALLY ONE OF THE MOST DOUBTFUL VOTERS IN THEBOROUGHWILLING FOR HIS OWN PART TO SUPPLY AN EQUAL QUALITY OF TEAS ANDSUGARS TO REFORMER AND ANTIREFORMER AS WELL AS TO AGREE IMPARTIALLYWITH BOTH AND FEELING LIKE THE BURGESSES OF OLD THAT THIS NECESSITY OFELECTING MEMBERS WAS A GREAT BURTHEN TO A TOWN FOR EVEN IF THERE WERENO DANGER IN HOLDING OUT HOPES TO ALL PARTIES BEFOREHAND THERE WOULDBE THE PAINFUL NECESSITY AT LAST OF DISAPPOINTING RESPECTABLE PEOPLEWHOSE NAMES WERE ON HIS BOOKS
 HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE LARGEORDERS FROM MR
 BROOKE OF TIPTON BUT THEN THERE WERE MANY OFPINKERTONS COMMITTEE WHOSE OPINIONS HAD A GREAT WEIGHT OF GROCERY ONTHEIR SIDE
 MR
 MAWMSEY THINKING THAT MR
 BROOKE AS NOT TOO CLEVER INHIS INTELLECTS WAS THE MORE LIKELY TO FORGIVE A GROCER WHO GAVE AHOSTILE VOTE UNDER PRESSURE HAD BECOME CONFIDENTIAL IN HIS BACKPARLOR
AS TO REFORM SIR PUT IT IN A FAMILY LIGHT HE SAID RATTLING THESMALL SILVER IN HIS POCKET AND SMILING AFFABLY
 WILL IT SUPPORT MRS
MAWMSEY AND ENABLE HER TO BRING UP SIX CHILDREN WHEN I AM NO MORE
 IPUT THE QUESTION FICTIOUSLY KNOWING WHAT MUST BE THE ANSWER
 VERYWELL SIR
 I ASK YOU WHAT AS A HUSBAND AND A FATHER I AM TO DO WHENGENTLEMEN COME TO ME AND SAY DO AS YOU LIKE MAWMSEY BUT IF YOU VOTEAGAINST US I SHALL GET MY GROCERIES ELSEWHERE WHEN I SUGAR MY LIQUORI LIKE TO FEEL THAT I AM BENEFITING THE COUNTRY BY MAINTAININGTRADESMEN OF THE RIGHT COLOR
 THOSE VERY WORDS HAVE BEEN SPOKEN TO MESIR IN THE VERY CHAIR WHERE YOU ARE NOW SITTING
 I DONT MEAN BY YOURHONORABLE SELF MR
 BROOKE
NO NO NOTHATS NARROW YOU KNOW
 UNTIL MY BUTLER COMPLAINS TO ME OFYOUR GOODS MR
 MAWMSEY SAID MR
 BROOKE SOOTHINGLY UNTIL I HEARTHAT YOU SEND BAD SUGARS SPICESTHAT SORT OF THINGI SHALL NEVER ORDERHIM TO GO ELSEWHERE
SIR I AM YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT AND GREATLY OBLIGED SAID MR
 MAWMSEYFEELING THAT POLITICS WERE CLEARING UP A LITTLE
 THERE WOULD BE SOMEPLEASURE IN VOTING FOR A GENTLEMAN WHO SPEAKS IN THAT HONORABLEMANNER
WELL YOU KNOW MR
 MAWMSEY YOU WOULD FIND IT THE RIGHT THING TO PUTYOURSELF ON OUR SIDE
 THIS REFORM WILL TOUCH EVERYBODY BYANDBYATHOROUGHLY POPULAR MEASUREA SORT OF A B C YOU KNOW THAT MUST COMEFIRST BEFORE THE REST CAN FOLLOW
 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT YOUVEGOT TO LOOK AT THE THING IN A FAMILY LIGHT BUT PUBLIC SPIRIT NOW
WERE ALL ONE FAMILY YOU KNOWITS ALL ONE CUPBOARD
 SUCH A THING AS AVOTE NOW WHY IT MAY HELP TO MAKE MENS FORTUNES AT THE CAPETHERESNO KNOWING WHAT MAY BE THE EFFECT OF A VOTE MR
 BROOKE ENDED WITH ASENSE OF BEING A LITTLE OUT AT SEA THOUGH FINDING IT STILL ENJOYABLE
BUT MR
 MAWMSEY ANSWERED IN A TONE OF DECISIVE CHECK
I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR BUT I CANT AFFORD THAT
 WHEN I GIVE A VOTE IMUST KNOW WHAT I AM DOING I MUST LOOK TO WHAT WILL BE THE EFFECTS ONMY TILL AND LEDGER SPEAKING RESPECTFULLY
 PRICES ILL ADMIT ARE WHATNOBODY CAN KNOW THE MERITS OF AND THE SUDDEN FALLS AFTER YOUVE BOUGHTIN CURRANTS WHICH ARE A GOODS THAT WILL NOT KEEPIVE NEVER MYSELFSEEN INTO THE INS AND OUTS THERE WHICH IS A REBUKE TO HUMAN PRIDE
 BUTAS TO ONE FAMILY THERES DEBTOR AND CREDITOR I HOPE THEYRE NOTGOING TO REFORM THAT AWAY ELSE I SHOULD VOTE FOR THINGS STAYING ASTHEY ARE
 FEW MEN HAVE LESS NEED TO CRY FOR CHANGE THAN I HAVEPERSONALLY SPEAKINGTHAT IS FOR SELF AND FAMILY
 I AM NOT ONE OF THOSEWHO HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE I MEAN AS TO RESPECTABILITY BOTH IN PARISHAND PRIVATE BUSINESS AND NOWAYS IN RESPECT OF YOUR HONORABLE SELF ANDCUSTOM WHICH YOU WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO SAY YOU WOULD NOT WITHDRAW FROMME VOTE OR NO VOTE WHILE THE ARTICLE SENT IN WAS SATISFACTORY
AFTER THIS CONVERSATION MR
 MAWMSEY WENT UP AND BOASTED TO HIS WIFETHAT HE HAD BEEN RATHER TOO MANY FOR BROOKE OF TIPTON AND THAT HEDIDNT MIND SO MUCH NOW ABOUT GOING TO THE POLL
MR
 BROOKE ON THIS OCCASION ABSTAINED FROM BOASTING OF HIS TACTICS TOLADISLAW WHO FOR HIS PART WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HEHAD NO CONCERN WITH ANY CANVASSING EXCEPT THE PURELY ARGUMENTATIVESORT AND THAT HE WORKED NO MEANER ENGINE THAN KNOWLEDGE
 MR
 BROOKENECESSARILY HAD HIS AGENTS WHO UNDERSTOOD THE NATURE OF THEMIDDLEMARCH VOTER AND THE MEANS OF ENLISTING HIS IGNORANCE ON THE SIDEOF THE BILLWHICH WERE REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO THE MEANS OF ENLISTING ITON THE SIDE AGAINST THE BILL
 WILL STOPPED HIS EARS
 OCCASIONALLYPARLIAMENT LIKE THE REST OF OUR LIVES EVEN TO OUR EATING AND APPARELCOULD HARDLY GO ON IF OUR IMAGINATIONS WERE TOO ACTIVE ABOUT PROCESSES
THERE WERE PLENTY OF DIRTYHANDED MEN IN THE WORLD TO DO DIRTYBUSINESS AND WILL PROTESTED TO HIMSELF THAT HIS SHARE IN BRINGING MR
BROOKE THROUGH WOULD BE QUITE INNOCENT
BUT WHETHER HE SHOULD SUCCEED IN THAT MODE OF CONTRIBUTING TO THEMAJORITY ON THE RIGHT SIDE WAS VERY DOUBTFUL TO HIM
 HE HAD WRITTEN OUTVARIOUS SPEECHES AND MEMORANDA FOR SPEECHES BUT HE HAD BEGUN TOPERCEIVE THAT MR
 BROOKES MIND IF IT HAD THE BURTHEN OF REMEMBERINGANY TRAIN OF THOUGHT WOULD LET IT DROP RUN AWAY IN SEARCH OF IT ANDNOT EASILY COME BACK AGAIN
 TO COLLECT DOCUMENTS IS ONE MODE OF SERVINGYOUR COUNTRY AND TO REMEMBER THE CONTENTS OF A DOCUMENT IS ANOTHER
NO
 THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH MR
 BROOKE COULD BE COERCED INTO THINKING OFTHE RIGHT ARGUMENTS AT THE RIGHT TIME WAS TO BE WELL PLIED WITH THEMTILL THEY TOOK UP ALL THE ROOM IN HIS BRAIN
 BUT HERE THERE WAS THEDIFFICULTY OF FINDING ROOM SO MANY THINGS HAVING BEEN TAKEN INBEFOREHAND
 MR
 BROOKE HIMSELF OBSERVED THAT HIS IDEAS STOOD RATHER INHIS WAY WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING
HOWEVER LADISLAWS COACHING WAS FORTHWITH TO BE PUT TO THE TEST FORBEFORE THE DAY OF NOMINATION MR
 BROOKE WAS TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF TO THEWORTHY ELECTORS OF MIDDLEMARCH FROM THE BALCONY OF THE WHITE HARTWHICH LOOKED OUT ADVANTAGEOUSLY AT AN ANGLE OF THE MARKETPLACECOMMANDING A LARGE AREA IN FRONT AND TWO CONVERGING STREETS
 IT WAS AFINE MAY MORNING AND EVERYTHING SEEMED HOPEFUL THERE WAS SOMEPROSPECT OF AN UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN BAGSTERS COMMITTEE AND BROOKESTO WHICH MR
 BULSTRODE MR
 STANDISH AS A LIBERAL LAWYER AND SUCHMANUFACTURERS AS MR
 PLYMDALE AND MR
 VINCY GAVE A SOLIDITY WHICHALMOST COUNTERBALANCED MR
 HAWLEY AND HIS ASSOCIATES WHO SAT FORPINKERTON AT THE GREEN DRAGON
 MR
 BROOKE CONSCIOUS OF HAVING WEAKENEDTHE BLASTS OF THE TRUMPET AGAINST HIM BY HIS REFORMS AS A LANDLORDIN THE LAST HALF YEAR AND HEARING HIMSELF CHEERED A LITTLE AS HE DROVEINTO THE TOWN FELT HIS HEART TOLERABLY LIGHT UNDER HIS BUFFCOLOREDWAISTCOAT
 BUT WITH REGARD TO CRITICAL OCCASIONS IT OFTEN HAPPENS THATALL MOMENTS SEEM COMFORTABLY REMOTE UNTIL THE LAST
THIS LOOKS WELL EH
 SAID MR
 BROOKE AS THE CROWD GATHERED
 I SHALLHAVE A GOOD AUDIENCE AT ANY RATE
 I LIKE THIS NOWTHIS KIND OF PUBLICMADE UP OF ONES OWN NEIGHBORS YOU KNOW
THE WEAVERS AND TANNERS OF MIDDLEMARCH UNLIKE MR
 MAWMSEY HAD NEVERTHOUGHT OF MR
 BROOKE AS A NEIGHBOR AND WERE NOT MORE ATTACHED TO HIMTHAN IF HE HAD BEEN SENT IN A BOX FROM LONDON
 BUT THEY LISTENEDWITHOUT MUCH DISTURBANCE TO THE SPEAKERS WHO INTRODUCED THE CANDIDATEONE OF THEMA POLITICAL PERSONAGE FROM BRASSING WHO CAME TO TELLMIDDLEMARCH ITS DUTYSPOKE SO FULLY THAT IT WAS ALARMING TO THINK WHATTHE CANDIDATE COULD FIND TO SAY AFTER HIM
 MEANWHILE THE CROWD BECAMEDENSER AND AS THE POLITICAL PERSONAGE NEARED THE END OF HIS SPEECHMR
 BROOKE FELT A REMARKABLE CHANGE IN HIS SENSATIONS WHILE HE STILLHANDLED HIS EYEGLASS TRIFLED WITH DOCUMENTS BEFORE HIM AND EXCHANGEDREMARKS WITH HIS COMMITTEE AS A MAN TO WHOM THE MOMENT OF SUMMONS WASINDIFFERENT
ILL TAKE ANOTHER GLASS OF SHERRY LADISLAW HE SAID WITH AN EASYAIR TO WILL WHO WAS CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND PRESENTLY HANDED HIM THESUPPOSED FORTIFIER
 IT WAS ILLCHOSEN FOR MR
 BROOKE WAS AN ABSTEMIOUSMAN AND TO DRINK A SECOND GLASS OF SHERRY QUICKLY AT NO GREAT INTERVALFROM THE FIRST WAS A SURPRISE TO HIS SYSTEM WHICH TENDED TO SCATTER HISENERGIES INSTEAD OF COLLECTING THEM
 PRAY PITY HIM SO MANY ENGLISHGENTLEMEN MAKE THEMSELVES MISERABLE BY SPEECHIFYING ON ENTIRELY PRIVATEGROUNDS
 WHEREAS MR
 BROOKE WISHED TO SERVE HIS COUNTRY BY STANDING FORPARLIAMENTWHICH INDEED MAY ALSO BE DONE ON PRIVATE GROUNDS BUTBEING ONCE UNDERTAKEN DOES ABSOLUTELY DEMAND SOME SPEECHIFYING
IT WAS NOT ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF HIS SPEECH THAT MR
 BROOKE WAS AT ALLANXIOUS THIS HE FELT SURE WOULD BE ALL RIGHT HE SHOULD HAVE ITQUITE PAT CUT OUT AS NEATLY AS A SET OF COUPLETS FROM POPE
 EMBARKINGWOULD BE EASY BUT THE VISION OF OPEN SEA THAT MIGHT COME AFTER WASALARMING
 AND QUESTIONS NOW HINTED THE DEMON JUST WAKING UP IN HISSTOMACH SOMEBODY MAY PUT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCHEDULES
LADISLAW HECONTINUED ALOUD JUST HAND ME THE MEMORANDUM OF THE SCHEDULES
WHEN MR
 BROOKE PRESENTED HIMSELF ON THE BALCONY THE CHEERS WERE QUITELOUD ENOUGH TO COUNTERBALANCE THE YELLS GROANS BRAYINGS AND OTHEREXPRESSIONS OF ADVERSE THEORY WHICH WERE SO MODERATE THAT MR
 STANDISHDECIDEDLY AN OLD BIRD OBSERVED IN THE EAR NEXT TO HIM THIS LOOKSDANGEROUS BY GOD
 HAWLEY HAS GOT SOME DEEPER PLAN THAN THIS
 STILLTHE CHEERS WERE EXHILARATING AND NO CANDIDATE COULD LOOK MORE AMIABLETHAN MR
 BROOKE WITH THE MEMORANDUM IN HIS BREASTPOCKET HIS LEFTHAND ON THE RAIL OF THE BALCONY AND HIS RIGHT TRIFLING WITH HISEYEGLASS
 THE STRIKING POINTS IN HIS APPEARANCE WERE HIS BUFFWAISTCOAT SHORTCLIPPED BLOND HAIR AND NEUTRAL PHYSIOGNOMY
 HE BEGANWITH SOME CONFIDENCE
GENTLEMENELECTORS OF MIDDLEMARCH
THIS WAS SO MUCH THE RIGHT THING THAT A LITTLE PAUSE AFTER IT SEEMEDNATURAL
IM UNCOMMONLY GLAD TO BE HEREI WAS NEVER SO PROUD AND HAPPY IN MYLIFENEVER SO HAPPY YOU KNOW
THIS WAS A BOLD FIGURE OF SPEECH BUT NOT EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING FORUNHAPPILY THE PAT OPENING HAD SLIPPED AWAYEVEN COUPLETS FROM POPE MAYBE BUT FALLINGS FROM US VANISHINGS WHEN FEAR CLUTCHES US AND AGLASS OF SHERRY IS HURRYING LIKE SMOKE AMONG OUR IDEAS
 LADISLAW WHOSTOOD AT THE WINDOW BEHIND THE SPEAKER THOUGHT ITS ALL UP NOW
 THEONLY CHANCE IS THAT SINCE THE BEST THING WONT ALWAYS DO FLOUNDERINGMAY ANSWER FOR ONCE
 MR
 BROOKE MEANWHILE HAVING LOST OTHER CLEWSFELL BACK ON HIMSELF AND HIS QUALIFICATIONSALWAYS AN APPROPRIATEGRACEFUL SUBJECT FOR A CANDIDATE
I AM A CLOSE NEIGHBOR OF YOURS MY GOOD FRIENDSYOUVE KNOWN ME ON THEBENCH A GOOD WHILEIVE ALWAYS GONE A GOOD DEAL INTO PUBLICQUESTIONSMACHINERY NOW AND MACHINEBREAKINGYOURE MANY OF YOUCONCERNED WITH MACHINERY AND IVE BEEN GOING INTO THAT LATELY
 ITWONT DO YOU KNOW BREAKING MACHINES EVERYTHING MUST GO ONTRADEMANUFACTURES COMMERCE INTERCHANGE OF STAPLESTHAT KIND OF THINGSINCEADAM SMITH THAT MUST GO ON
 WE MUST LOOK ALL OVER THEGLOBEOBSERVATION WITH EXTENSIVE VIEW MUST LOOK EVERYWHERE FROMCHINA TO PERU AS SOMEBODY SAYSJOHNSON I THINK THE RAMBLER YOUKNOW
 THAT IS WHAT I HAVE DONE UP TO A CERTAIN POINTNOT AS FAR ASPERU BUT IVE NOT ALWAYS STAYED AT HOMEI SAW IT WOULDNT DO
 IVEBEEN IN THE LEVANT WHERE SOME OF YOUR MIDDLEMARCH GOODS GOAND THENAGAIN IN THE BALTIC
 THE BALTIC NOW
PLYING AMONG HIS RECOLLECTIONS IN THIS WAY MR
 BROOKE MIGHT HAVE GOTALONG EASILY TO HIMSELF AND WOULD HAVE COME BACK FROM THE REMOTESTSEAS WITHOUT TROUBLE BUT A DIABOLICAL PROCEDURE HAD BEEN SET UP BY THEENEMY
 AT ONE AND THE SAME MOMENT THERE HAD RISEN ABOVE THE SHOULDERSOF THE CROWD NEARLY OPPOSITE MR
 BROOKE AND WITHIN TEN YARDS OF HIMTHE EFFIGY OF HIMSELF BUFFCOLORED WAISTCOAT EYEGLASS AND NEUTRALPHYSIOGNOMY PAINTED ON RAG AND THERE HAD ARISEN APPARENTLY IN THEAIR LIKE THE NOTE OF THE CUCKOO A PARROTLIKE PUNCHVOICED ECHO OFHIS WORDS
 EVERYBODY LOOKED UP AT THE OPEN WINDOWS IN THE HOUSES AT THEOPPOSITE ANGLES OF THE CONVERGING STREETS BUT THEY WERE EITHER BLANKOR FILLED BY LAUGHING LISTENERS
 THE MOST INNOCENT ECHO HAS AN IMPISHMOCKERY IN IT WHEN IT FOLLOWS A GRAVELY PERSISTENT SPEAKER AND THISECHO WAS NOT AT ALL INNOCENT IF IT DID NOT FOLLOW WITH THE PRECISIONOF A NATURAL ECHO IT HAD A WICKED CHOICE OF THE WORDS IT OVERTOOK
 BYTHE TIME IT SAID THE BALTIC NOW THE LAUGH WHICH HAD BEEN RUNNINGTHROUGH THE AUDIENCE BECAME A GENERAL SHOUT AND BUT FOR THE SOBERINGEFFECTS OF PARTY AND THAT GREAT PUBLIC CAUSE WHICH THE ENTANGLEMENT OFTHINGS HAD IDENTIFIED WITH BROOKE OF TIPTON THE LAUGH MIGHT HAVECAUGHT HIS COMMITTEE
 MR
 BULSTRODE ASKED REPREHENSIVELY WHAT THE NEWPOLICE WAS DOING BUT A VOICE COULD NOT WELL BE COLLARED AND AN ATTACKON THE EFFIGY OF THE CANDIDATE WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO EQUIVOCAL SINCEHAWLEY PROBABLY MEANT IT TO BE PELTED
MR
 BROOKE HIMSELF WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO BE QUICKLY CONSCIOUS OFANYTHING EXCEPT A GENERAL SLIPPING AWAY OF IDEAS WITHIN HIMSELF HE HADEVEN A LITTLE SINGING IN THE EARS AND HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO HADNOT YET TAKEN DISTINCT ACCOUNT OF THE ECHO OR DISCERNED THE IMAGE OFHIMSELF
 FEW THINGS HOLD THE PERCEPTIONS MORE THOROUGHLY CAPTIVE THANANXIETY ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE GOT TO SAY
 MR
 BROOKE HEARD THE LAUGHTERBUT HE HAD EXPECTED SOME TORY EFFORTS AT DISTURBANCE AND HE WAS ATTHIS MOMENT ADDITIONALLY EXCITED BY THE TICKLING STINGING SENSE THATHIS LOST EXORDIUM WAS COMING BACK TO FETCH HIM FROM THE BALTIC
THAT REMINDS ME HE WENT ON THRUSTING A HAND INTO HIS SIDEPOCKETWITH AN EASY AIR IF I WANTED A PRECEDENT YOU KNOWBUT WE NEVER WANTA PRECEDENT FOR THE RIGHT THINGBUT THERE IS CHATHAM NOW I CANT SAYI SHOULD HAVE SUPPORTED CHATHAM OR PITT THE YOUNGER PITTHE WAS NOT AMAN OF IDEAS AND WE WANT IDEAS YOU KNOW
BLAST YOUR IDEAS
 WE WANT THE BILL SAID A LOUD ROUGH VOICE FROM THECROWD BELOW
IMMEDIATELY THE INVISIBLE PUNCH WHO HAD HITHERTO FOLLOWED MR
 BROOKEREPEATED BLAST YOUR IDEAS
 WE WANT THE BILL
 THE LAUGH WAS LOUDERTHAN EVER AND FOR THE FIRST TIME MR
 BROOKE BEING HIMSELF SILENTHEARD DISTINCTLY THE MOCKING ECHO
 BUT IT SEEMED TO RIDICULE HISINTERRUPTER AND IN THAT LIGHT WAS ENCOURAGING SO HE REPLIED WITHAMENITYTHERE IS SOMETHING IN WHAT YOU SAY MY GOOD FRIEND AND WHAT DO WEMEET FOR BUT TO SPEAK OUR MINDSFREEDOM OF OPINION FREEDOM OF THEPRESS LIBERTYTHAT KIND OF THING
 THE BILL NOWYOU SHALL HAVE THEBILLHERE MR
 BROOKE PAUSED A MOMENT TO FIX ON HIS EYEGLASS AND TAKETHE PAPER FROM HIS BREASTPOCKET WITH A SENSE OF BEING PRACTICAL ANDCOMING TO PARTICULARS
 THE INVISIBLE PUNCH FOLLOWEDYOU SHALL HAVE THE BILL MR
 BROOKE PER ELECTIONEERING CONTEST AND ASEAT OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT AS DELIVERED FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS SEVENSHILLINGS AND FOURPENCE
MR
 BROOKE AMID THE ROARS OF LAUGHTER TURNED RED LET HIS EYEGLASSFALL AND LOOKING ABOUT HIM CONFUSEDLY SAW THE IMAGE OF HIMSELF WHICHHAD COME NEARER
 THE NEXT MOMENT HE SAW IT DOLOROUSLY BESPATTERED WITHEGGS
 HIS SPIRIT ROSE A LITTLE AND HIS VOICE TOO
BUFFOONERY TRICKS RIDICULE THE TEST OF TRUTHALL THAT IS VERYWELLHERE AN UNPLEASANT EGG BROKE ON MR
 BROOKES SHOULDER AS THEECHO SAID ALL THAT IS VERY WELL THEN CAME A HAIL OF EGGS CHIEFLYAIMED AT THE IMAGE BUT OCCASIONALLY HITTING THE ORIGINAL AS IF BYCHANCE
 THERE WAS A STREAM OF NEW MEN PUSHING AMONG THE CROWDWHISTLES YELLS BELLOWINGS AND FIFES MADE ALL THE GREATER HUBBUBBECAUSE THERE WAS SHOUTING AND STRUGGLING TO PUT THEM DOWN
 NO VOICEWOULD HAVE HAD WING ENOUGH TO RISE ABOVE THE UPROAR AND MR
 BROOKEDISAGREEABLY ANOINTED STOOD HIS GROUND NO LONGER
 THE FRUSTRATIONWOULD HAVE BEEN LESS EXASPERATING IF IT HAD BEEN LESS GAMESOME ANDBOYISH A SERIOUS ASSAULT OF WHICH THE NEWSPAPER REPORTER CAN AVERTHAT IT ENDANGERED THE LEARNED GENTLEMANS RIBS OR CAN RESPECTFULLYBEAR WITNESS TO THE SOLES OF THAT GENTLEMANS BOOTS HAVING BEENVISIBLE ABOVE THE RAILING HAS PERHAPS MORE CONSOLATIONS ATTACHED TOIT
MR
 BROOKE REENTERED THE COMMITTEEROOM SAYING AS CARELESSLY AS HECOULD THIS IS A LITTLE TOO BAD YOU KNOW
 I SHOULD HAVE GOT THE EAROF THE PEOPLE BYANDBYBUT THEY DIDNT GIVE ME TIME
 I SHOULD HAVEGONE INTO THE BILL BYANDBY YOU KNOW HE ADDED GLANCING ATLADISLAW
 HOWEVER THINGS WILL COME ALL RIGHT AT THE NOMINATION
BUT IT WAS NOT RESOLVED UNANIMOUSLY THAT THINGS WOULD COME RIGHT ONTHE CONTRARY THE COMMITTEE LOOKED RATHER GRIM AND THE POLITICALPERSONAGE FROM BRASSING WAS WRITING BUSILY AS IF HE WERE BREWING NEWDEVICES
IT WAS BOWYER WHO DID IT SAID MR
 STANDISH EVASIVELY
 I KNOW IT ASWELL AS IF HE HAD BEEN ADVERTISED
 HES UNCOMMONLY GOOD ATVENTRILOQUISM AND HE DID IT UNCOMMONLY WELL BY GOD
 HAWLEY HAS BEENHAVING HIM TO DINNER LATELY THERES A FUND OF TALENT IN BOWYER
WELL YOU KNOW YOU NEVER MENTIONED HIM TO ME STANDISH ELSE I WOULDHAVE INVITED HIM TO DINE SAID POOR MR
 BROOKE WHO HAD GONE THROUGH AGREAT DEAL OF INVITING FOR THE GOOD OF HIS COUNTRY
THERES NOT A MORE PALTRY FELLOW IN MIDDLEMARCH THAN BOWYER SAIDLADISLAW INDIGNANTLY BUT IT SEEMS AS IF THE PALTRY FELLOWS WEREALWAYS TO TURN THE SCALE
WILL WAS THOROUGHLY OUT OF TEMPER WITH HIMSELF AS WELL AS WITH HISPRINCIPAL AND HE WENT TO SHUT HIMSELF IN HIS ROOMS WITH AHALFFORMED RESOLVE TO THROW UP THE PIONEER AND MR
 BROOKE TOGETHER
WHY SHOULD HE STAY
 IF THE IMPASSABLE GULF BETWEEN HIMSELF AND DOROTHEAWERE EVER TO BE FILLED UP IT MUST RATHER BE BY HIS GOING AWAY ANDGETTING INTO A THOROUGHLY DIFFERENT POSITION THAN BY STAYING HERE ANDSLIPPING INTO DESERVED CONTEMPT AS AN UNDERSTRAPPER OF BROOKES
 THENCAME THE YOUNG DREAM OF WONDERS THAT HE MIGHT DOIN FIVE YEARS FOREXAMPLE POLITICAL WRITING POLITICAL SPEAKING WOULD GET A HIGHERVALUE NOW PUBLIC LIFE WAS GOING TO BE WIDER AND MORE NATIONAL AND THEYMIGHT GIVE HIM SUCH DISTINCTION THAT HE WOULD NOT SEEM TO BE ASKINGDOROTHEA TO STEP DOWN TO HIM
 FIVE YEARSIF HE COULD ONLY BE SURE THATSHE CARED FOR HIM MORE THAN FOR OTHERS IF HE COULD ONLY MAKE HER AWARETHAT HE STOOD ALOOF UNTIL HE COULD TELL HIS LOVE WITHOUT LOWERINGHIMSELFTHEN HE COULD GO AWAY EASILY AND BEGIN A CAREER WHICH ATFIVEANDTWENTY SEEMED PROBABLE ENOUGH IN THE INWARD ORDER OF THINGSWHERE TALENT BRINGS FAME AND FAME EVERYTHING ELSE WHICH IS DELIGHTFUL
HE COULD SPEAK AND HE COULD WRITE HE COULD MASTER ANY SUBJECT IF HECHOSE AND HE MEANT ALWAYS TO TAKE THE SIDE OF REASON AND JUSTICE ONWHICH HE WOULD CARRY ALL HIS ARDOR
 WHY SHOULD HE NOT ONE DAY BE LIFTEDABOVE THE SHOULDERS OF THE CROWD AND FEEL THAT HE HAD WON THATEMINENCE WELL
 WITHOUT DOUBT HE WOULD LEAVE MIDDLEMARCH GO TO TOWNAND MAKE HIMSELF FIT FOR CELEBRITY BY EATING HIS DINNERS
BUT NOT IMMEDIATELY NOT UNTIL SOME KIND OF SIGN HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIMAND DOROTHEA
 HE COULD NOT BE SATISFIED UNTIL SHE KNEW WHY EVEN IF HEWERE THE MAN SHE WOULD CHOOSE TO MARRY HE WOULD NOT MARRY HER
 HENCEHE MUST KEEP HIS POST AND BEAR WITH MR
 BROOKE A LITTLE LONGER
BUT HE SOON HAD REASON TO SUSPECT THAT MR
 BROOKE HAD ANTICIPATED HIMIN THE WISH TO BREAK UP THEIR CONNECTION
 DEPUTATIONS WITHOUT ANDVOICES WITHIN HAD CONCURRED IN INDUCING THAT PHILANTHROPIST TO TAKE ASTRONGER MEASURE THAN USUAL FOR THE GOOD OF MANKIND NAMELY TOWITHDRAW IN FAVOR OF ANOTHER CANDIDATE TO WHOM HE LEFT THE ADVANTAGESOF HIS CANVASSING MACHINERY
 HE HIMSELF CALLED THIS A STRONG MEASUREBUT OBSERVED THAT HIS HEALTH WAS LESS CAPABLE OF SUSTAINING EXCITEMENTTHAN HE HAD IMAGINED
I HAVE FELT UNEASY ABOUT THE CHESTIT WONT DO TO CARRY THAT TOO FARHE SAID TO LADISLAW IN EXPLAINING THE AFFAIR
 I MUST PULL UP
 POORCASAUBON WAS A WARNING YOU KNOW
 IVE MADE SOME HEAVY ADVANCES BUTIVE DUG A CHANNEL
 ITS RATHER COARSE WORKTHIS ELECTIONEERING EHLADISLAW
 DARE SAY YOU ARE TIRED OF IT
 HOWEVER WE HAVE DUG A CHANNELWITH THE PIONEERPUT THINGS IN A TRACK AND SO ON
 A MORE ORDINARYMAN THAN YOU MIGHT CARRY IT ON NOWMORE ORDINARY YOU KNOW
DO YOU WISH ME TO GIVE IT UP
 SAID WILL THE QUICK COLOR COMING INHIS FACE AS HE ROSE FROM THE WRITINGTABLE AND TOOK A TURN OF THREESTEPS WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS
 I AM READY TO DO SO WHENEVER YOUWISH IT
AS TO WISHING MY DEAR LADISLAW I HAVE THE HIGHEST OPINION OF YOURPOWERS YOU KNOW
 BUT ABOUT THE PIONEER I HAVE BEEN CONSULTING ALITTLE WITH SOME OF THE MEN ON OUR SIDE AND THEY ARE INCLINED TO TAKEIT INTO THEIR HANDSINDEMNIFY ME TO A CERTAIN EXTENTCARRY IT ON INFACT
 AND UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU MIGHT LIKE TO GIVE UPMIGHT FINDA BETTER FIELD
 THESE PEOPLE MIGHT NOT TAKE THAT HIGH VIEW OF YOU WHICHI HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN AS AN ALTER EGO A RIGHT HANDTHOUGH I ALWAYSLOOKED FORWARD TO YOUR DOING SOMETHING ELSE
 I THINK OF HAVING A RUNINTO FRANCE
 BUT ILL WRITE YOU ANY LETTERS YOU KNOWTO ALTHORPE ANDPEOPLE OF THAT KIND
 IVE MET ALTHORPE
I AM EXCEEDINGLY OBLIGED TO YOU SAID LADISLAW PROUDLY
 SINCE YOUARE GOING TO PART WITH THE PIONEER I NEED NOT TROUBLE YOU ABOUT THESTEPS I SHALL TAKE
 I MAY CHOOSE TO CONTINUE HERE FOR THE PRESENT
AFTER MR
 BROOKE HAD LEFT HIM WILL SAID TO HIMSELF THE REST OF THEFAMILY HAVE BEEN URGING HIM TO GET RID OF ME AND HE DOESNT CARE NOWABOUT MY GOING
 I SHALL STAY AS LONG AS I LIKE
 I SHALL GO OF MY OWNMOVEMENTS AND NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF ME
CHAPTER LII
HIS HEARTTHE LOWLIEST DUTIES ON ITSELF DID LAY
WORDSWORTH
ON THAT JUNE EVENING WHEN MR
 FAREBROTHER KNEW THAT HE WAS TO HAVE THELOWICK LIVING THERE WAS JOY IN THE OLD FASHIONED PARLOR AND EVEN THEPORTRAITS OF THE GREAT LAWYERS SEEMED TO LOOK ON WITH SATISFACTION
 HISMOTHER LEFT HER TEA AND TOAST UNTOUCHED BUT SAT WITH HER USUAL PRETTYPRIMNESS ONLY SHOWING HER EMOTION BY THAT FLUSH IN THE CHEEKS ANDBRIGHTNESS IN THE EYES WHICH GIVE AN OLD WOMAN A TOUCHING MOMENTARYIDENTITY WITH HER FAROFF YOUTHFUL SELF AND SAYING DECISIVELYTHE GREATEST COMFORT CAMDEN IS THAT YOU HAVE DESERVED IT
WHEN A MAN GETS A GOOD BERTH MOTHER HALF THE DESERVING MUST COMEAFTER SAID THE SON BRIMFUL OF PLEASURE AND NOT TRYING TO CONCEALIT
 THE GLADNESS IN HIS FACE WAS OF THAT ACTIVE KIND WHICH SEEMS TOHAVE ENERGY ENOUGH NOT ONLY TO FLASH OUTWARDLY BUT TO LIGHT UP BUSYVISION WITHIN ONE SEEMED TO SEE THOUGHTS AS WELL AS DELIGHT IN HISGLANCES
NOW AUNT HE WENT ON RUBBING HIS HANDS AND LOOKING AT MISS NOBLEWHO WAS MAKING TENDER LITTLE BEAVERLIKE NOISES THERE SHALL BESUGARCANDY ALWAYS ON THE TABLE FOR YOU TO STEAL AND GIVE TO THECHILDREN AND YOU SHALL HAVE A GREAT MANY NEW STOCKINGS TO MAKEPRESENTS OF AND YOU SHALL DARN YOUR OWN MORE THAN EVER
MISS NOBLE NODDED AT HER NEPHEW WITH A SUBDUED HALFFRIGHTENED LAUGHCONSCIOUS OF HAVING ALREADY DROPPED AN ADDITIONAL LUMP OF SUGAR INTOHER BASKET ON THE STRENGTH OF THE NEW PREFERMENT
AS FOR YOU WINNYTHE VICAR WENT ONI SHALL MAKE NO DIFFICULTY ABOUTYOUR MARRYING ANY LOWICK BACHELORMR
 SOLOMON FEATHERSTONE FOREXAMPLE AS SOON AS I FIND YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH HIM
MISS WINIFRED WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING AT HER BROTHER ALL THE WHILE ANDCRYING HEARTILY WHICH WAS HER WAY OF REJOICING SMILED THROUGH HERTEARS AND SAID YOU MUST SET ME THE EXAMPLE CAM YOU MUST MARRYNOW
WITH ALL MY HEART
 BUT WHO IS IN LOVE WITH ME
 I AM A SEEDY OLDFELLOW SAID THE VICAR RISING PUSHING HIS CHAIR AWAY AND LOOKINGDOWN AT HIMSELF
 WHAT DO YOU SAY MOTHER
YOU ARE A HANDSOME MAN CAMDEN THOUGH NOT SO FINE A FIGURE OF A MANAS YOUR FATHER SAID THE OLD LADY
I WISH YOU WOULD MARRY MISS GARTH BROTHER SAID MISS WINIFRED
 SHEWOULD MAKE US SO LIVELY AT LOWICK
VERY FINE
 YOU TALK AS IF YOUNG WOMEN WERE TIED UP TO BE CHOSEN LIKEPOULTRY AT MARKET AS IF I HAD ONLY TO ASK AND EVERYBODY WOULD HAVEME SAID THE VICAR NOT CARING TO SPECIFY
WE DONT WANT EVERYBODY SAID MISS WINIFRED
 BUT YOU WOULD LIKEMISS GARTH MOTHER SHOULDNT YOU
MY SONS CHOICE SHALL BE MINE SAID MRS
 FAREBROTHER WITH MAJESTICDISCRETION AND A WIFE WOULD BE MOST WELCOME CAMDEN
 YOU WILL WANTYOUR WHIST AT HOME WHEN WE GO TO LOWICK AND HENRIETTA NOBLE NEVER WASA WHISTPLAYER
 MRS
 FAREBROTHER ALWAYS CALLED HER TINY OLD SISTER BYTHAT MAGNIFICENT NAME
I SHALL DO WITHOUT WHIST NOW MOTHER
WHY SO CAMDEN
 IN MY TIME WHIST WAS THOUGHT AN UNDENIABLE AMUSEMENTFOR A GOOD CHURCHMAN SAID MRS
 FAREBROTHER INNOCENT OF THE MEANINGTHAT WHIST HAD FOR HER SON AND SPEAKING RATHER SHARPLY AS AT SOMEDANGEROUS COUNTENANCING OF NEW DOCTRINE
I SHALL BE TOO BUSY FOR WHIST I SHALL HAVE TWO PARISHES SAID THEVICAR PREFERRING NOT TO DISCUSS THE VIRTUES OF THAT GAME
HE HAD ALREADY SAID TO DOROTHEA I DONT FEEL BOUND TO GIVE UP ST
BOTOLPHS
 IT IS PROTEST ENOUGH AGAINST THE PLURALISM THEY WANT TOREFORM IF I GIVE SOMEBODY ELSE MOST OF THE MONEY
 THE STRONGER THING ISNOT TO GIVE UP POWER BUT TO USE IT WELL
I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT SAID DOROTHEA
 SO FAR AS SELF IS CONCERNEDI THINK IT WOULD BE EASIER TO GIVE UP POWER AND MONEY THAN TO KEEPTHEM
 IT SEEMS VERY UNFITTING THAT I SHOULD HAVE THIS PATRONAGE YET IFELT THAT I OUGHT NOT TO LET IT BE USED BY SOME ONE ELSE INSTEAD OFME
IT IS I WHO AM BOUND TO ACT SO THAT YOU WILL NOT REGRET YOUR POWERSAID MR
 FAREBROTHER
HIS WAS ONE OF THE NATURES IN WHICH CONSCIENCE GETS THE MORE ACTIVEWHEN THE YOKE OF LIFE CEASES TO GALL THEM
 HE MADE NO DISPLAY OFHUMILITY ON THE SUBJECT BUT IN HIS HEART HE FELT RATHER ASHAMED THATHIS CONDUCT HAD SHOWN LACHES WHICH OTHERS WHO DID NOT GET BENEFICESWERE FREE FROM
I USED OFTEN TO WISH I HAD BEEN SOMETHING ELSE THAN A CLERGYMAN HESAID TO LYDGATE BUT PERHAPS IT WILL BE BETTER TO TRY AND MAKE AS GOODA CLERGYMAN OUT OF MYSELF AS I CAN
 THAT IS THE WELLBENEFICED POINT OFVIEW YOU PERCEIVE FROM WHICH DIFFICULTIES ARE MUCH SIMPLIFIED HEENDED SMILING
THE VICAR DID FEEL THEN AS IF HIS SHARE OF DUTIES WOULD BE EASY
 BUTDUTY HAS A TRICK OF BEHAVING UNEXPECTEDLYSOMETHING LIKE A HEAVY FRIENDWHOM WE HAVE AMIABLY ASKED TO VISIT US AND WHO BREAKS HIS LEG WITHINOUR GATES
HARDLY A WEEK LATER DUTY PRESENTED ITSELF IN HIS STUDY UNDER THEDISGUISE OF FRED VINCY NOW RETURNED FROM OMNIBUS COLLEGE WITH HISBACHELORS DEGREE
I AM ASHAMED TO TROUBLE YOU MR
 FAREBROTHER SAID FRED WHOSE FAIROPEN FACE WAS PROPITIATING BUT YOU ARE THE ONLY FRIEND I CAN CONSULT
I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING ONCE BEFORE AND YOU WERE SO GOOD THAT I CANTHELP COMING TO YOU AGAIN
SIT DOWN FRED IM READY TO HEAR AND DO ANYTHING I CAN SAID THEVICAR WHO WAS BUSY PACKING SOME SMALL OBJECTS FOR REMOVAL AND WENT ONWITH HIS WORK
I WANTED TO TELL YOU FRED HESITATED AN INSTANT AND THEN WENT ONPLUNGINGLY I MIGHT GO INTO THE CHURCH NOW AND REALLY LOOK WHERE IMAY I CANT SEE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO
 I DONT LIKE IT BUT I KNOW ITSUNCOMMONLY HARD ON MY FATHER TO SAY SO AFTER HE HAS SPENT A GOOD DEALOF MONEY IN EDUCATING ME FOR IT
 FRED PAUSED AGAIN AN INSTANT ANDTHEN REPEATED AND I CANT SEE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO
I DID TALK TO YOUR FATHER ABOUT IT FRED BUT I MADE LITTLE WAY WITHHIM
 HE SAID IT WAS TOO LATE
 BUT YOU HAVE GOT OVER ONE BRIDGE NOWWHAT ARE YOUR OTHER DIFFICULTIES
MERELY THAT I DONT LIKE IT
 I DONT LIKE DIVINITY AND PREACHING ANDFEELING OBLIGED TO LOOK SERIOUS
 I LIKE RIDING ACROSS COUNTRY ANDDOING AS OTHER MEN DO
 I DONT MEAN THAT I WANT TO BE A BAD FELLOW INANY WAY BUT IVE NO TASTE FOR THE SORT OF THING PEOPLE EXPECT OF ACLERGYMAN
 AND YET WHAT ELSE AM I TO DO
 MY FATHER CANT SPARE ME ANYCAPITAL ELSE I MIGHT GO INTO FARMING
 AND HE HAS NO ROOM FOR ME IN HISTRADE
 AND OF COURSE I CANT BEGIN TO STUDY FOR LAW OR PHYSIC NOW WHENMY FATHER WANTS ME TO EARN SOMETHING
 ITS ALL VERY WELL TO SAY IMWRONG TO GO INTO THE CHURCH BUT THOSE WHO SAY SO MIGHT AS WELL TELL METO GO INTO THE BACKWOODS
FREDS VOICE HAD TAKEN A TONE OF GRUMBLING REMONSTRANCE AND MR
FAREBROTHER MIGHT HAVE BEEN INCLINED TO SMILE IF HIS MIND HAD NOT BEENTOO BUSY IN IMAGINING MORE THAN FRED TOLD HIM
HAVE YOU ANY DIFFICULTIES ABOUT DOCTRINESABOUT THE ARTICLES
 HESAID TRYING HARD TO THINK OF THE QUESTION SIMPLY FOR FREDS SAKE
NO I SUPPOSE THE ARTICLES ARE RIGHT
 I AM NOT PREPARED WITH ANYARGUMENTS TO DISPROVE THEM AND MUCH BETTER CLEVERER FELLOWS THAN I AMGO IN FOR THEM ENTIRELY
 I THINK IT WOULD BE RATHER RIDICULOUS IN ME TOURGE SCRUPLES OF THAT SORT AS IF I WERE A JUDGE SAID FRED QUITESIMPLY
I SUPPOSE THEN IT HAS OCCURRED TO YOU THAT YOU MIGHT BE A FAIRPARISH PRIEST WITHOUT BEING MUCH OF A DIVINE
OF COURSE IF I AM OBLIGED TO BE A CLERGYMAN I SHALL TRY AND DO MYDUTY THOUGH I MAYNT LIKE IT
 DO YOU THINK ANY BODY OUGHT TO BLAMEME
FOR GOING INTO THE CHURCH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
 THAT DEPENDS ONYOUR CONSCIENCE FREDHOW FAR YOU HAVE COUNTED THE COST AND SEEN WHATYOUR POSITION WILL REQUIRE OF YOU
 I CAN ONLY TELL YOU ABOUT MYSELFTHAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TOO LAX AND HAVE BEEN UNEASY IN CONSEQUENCE
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER HINDRANCE SAID FRED COLORING
 I DID NOT TELLYOU BEFORE THOUGH PERHAPS I MAY HAVE SAID THINGS THAT MADE YOU GUESSIT
 THERE IS SOMEBODY I AM VERY FOND OF I HAVE LOVED HER EVER SINCE WEWERE CHILDREN
MISS GARTH I SUPPOSE
 SAID THE VICAR EXAMINING SOME LABELS VERYCLOSELY
YES
 I SHOULDNT MIND ANYTHING IF SHE WOULD HAVE ME
 AND I KNOW ICOULD BE A GOOD FELLOW THEN
AND YOU THINK SHE RETURNS THE FEELING
SHE NEVER WILL SAY SO AND A GOOD WHILE AGO SHE MADE ME PROMISE NOT TOSPEAK TO HER ABOUT IT AGAIN
 AND SHE HAS SET HER MIND ESPECIALLYAGAINST MY BEING A CLERGYMAN I KNOW THAT
 BUT I CANT GIVE HER UP
 IDO THINK SHE CARES ABOUT ME
 I SAW MRS
 GARTH LAST NIGHT AND SHE SAIDTHAT MARY WAS STAYING AT LOWICK RECTORY WITH MISS FAREBROTHER
YES SHE IS VERY KINDLY HELPING MY SISTER
 DO YOU WISH TO GO THERE
NO I WANT TO ASK A GREAT FAVOR OF YOU
 I AM ASHAMED TO BOTHER YOU INTHIS WAY BUT MARY MIGHT LISTEN TO WHAT YOU SAID IF YOU MENTIONED THESUBJECT TO HERI MEAN ABOUT MY GOING INTO THE CHURCH
THAT IS RATHER A DELICATE TASK MY DEAR FRED
 I SHALL HAVE TOPRESUPPOSE YOUR ATTACHMENT TO HER AND TO ENTER ON THE SUBJECT AS YOUWISH ME TO DO WILL BE ASKING HER TO TELL ME WHETHER SHE RETURNS IT
THAT IS WHAT I WANT HER TO TELL YOU SAID FRED BLUNTLY
 I DONTKNOW WHAT TO DO UNLESS I CAN GET AT HER FEELING
YOU MEAN THAT YOU WOULD BE GUIDED BY THAT AS TO YOUR GOING INTO THECHURCH
IF MARY SAID SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE ME I MIGHT AS WELL GO WRONG IN ONEWAY AS ANOTHER
THAT IS NONSENSE FRED
 MEN OUTLIVE THEIR LOVE BUT THEY DONT OUTLIVETHE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR RECKLESSNESS
NOT MY SORT OF LOVE I HAVE NEVER BEEN WITHOUT LOVING MARY
 IF I HADTO GIVE HER UP IT WOULD BE LIKE BEGINNING TO LIVE ON WOODEN LEGS
WILL SHE NOT BE HURT AT MY INTRUSION
NO I FEEL SURE SHE WILL NOT
 SHE RESPECTS YOU MORE THAN ANY ONE ANDSHE WOULD NOT PUT YOU OFF WITH FUN AS SHE DOES ME
 OF COURSE I COULDNOT HAVE TOLD ANY ONE ELSE OR ASKED ANY ONE ELSE TO SPEAK TO HER BUTYOU
 THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WHO COULD BE SUCH A FRIEND TO BOTH OF US
FRED PAUSED A MOMENT AND THEN SAID RATHER COMPLAININGLY AND SHEOUGHT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE WORKED IN ORDER TO PASS
 SHE OUGHT TOBELIEVE THAT I WOULD EXERT MYSELF FOR HER SAKE
THERE WAS A MOMENTS SILENCE BEFORE MR
 FAREBROTHER LAID DOWN HIS WORKAND PUTTING OUT HIS HAND TO FRED SAIDVERY WELL MY BOY
 I WILL DO WHAT YOU WISH
THAT VERY DAY MR
 FAREBROTHER WENT TO LOWICK PARSONAGE ON THE NAG WHICHHE HAD JUST SET UP
 DECIDEDLY I AM AN OLD STALK HE THOUGHT THEYOUNG GROWTHS ARE PUSHING ME ASIDE
HE FOUND MARY IN THE GARDEN GATHERING ROSES AND SPRINKLING THE PETALSON A SHEET
 THE SUN WAS LOW AND TALL TREES SENT THEIR SHADOWS ACROSSTHE GRASSY WALKS WHERE MARY WAS MOVING WITHOUT BONNET OR PARASOL
 SHEDID NOT OBSERVE MR
 FAREBROTHERS APPROACH ALONG THE GRASS AND HADJUST STOOPED DOWN TO LECTURE A SMALL BLACKANDTAN TERRIER WHICH WOULDPERSIST IN WALKING ON THE SHEET AND SMELLING AT THE ROSELEAVES AS MARYSPRINKLED THEM
 SHE TOOK HIS FOREPAWS IN ONE HAND AND LIFTED UP THEFOREFINGER OF THE OTHER WHILE THE DOG WRINKLED HIS BROWS AND LOOKEDEMBARRASSED
 FLY FLY I AM ASHAMED OF YOU MARY WAS SAYING IN AGRAVE CONTRALTO
 THIS IS NOT BECOMING IN A SENSIBLE DOG ANYBODY WOULDTHINK YOU WERE A SILLY YOUNG GENTLEMAN
YOU ARE UNMERCIFUL TO YOUNG GENTLEMEN MISS GARTH SAID THE VICARWITHIN TWO YARDS OF HER
MARY STARTED UP AND BLUSHED
 IT ALWAYS ANSWERS TO REASON WITH FLYSHE SAID LAUGHINGLY
BUT NOT WITH YOUNG GENTLEMEN
OH WITH SOME I SUPPOSE SINCE SOME OF THEM TURN INTO EXCELLENT MEN
I AM GLAD OF THAT ADMISSION BECAUSE I WANT AT THIS VERY MOMENT TOINTEREST YOU IN A YOUNG GENTLEMAN
NOT A SILLY ONE I HOPE SAID MARY BEGINNING TO PLUCK THE ROSESAGAIN AND FEELING HER HEART BEAT UNCOMFORTABLY
NO THOUGH PERHAPS WISDOM IS NOT HIS STRONG POINT BUT RATHERAFFECTION AND SINCERITY
 HOWEVER WISDOM LIES MORE IN THOSE TWOQUALITIES THAN PEOPLE ARE APT TO IMAGINE
 I HOPE YOU KNOW BY THOSEMARKS WHAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN I MEAN
YES I THINK I DO SAID MARY BRAVELY HER FACE GETTING MORE SERIOUSAND HER HANDS COLD IT MUST BE FRED VINCY
HE HAS ASKED ME TO CONSULT YOU ABOUT HIS GOING INTO THE CHURCH
 I HOPEYOU WILL NOT THINK THAT I CONSENTED TO TAKE A LIBERTY IN PROMISING TODO SO
ON THE CONTRARY MR
 FAREBROTHER SAID MARY GIVING UP THE ROSES ANDFOLDING HER ARMS BUT UNABLE TO LOOK UP WHENEVER YOU HAVE ANYTHING TOSAY TO ME I FEEL HONORED
BUT BEFORE I ENTER ON THAT QUESTION LET ME JUST TOUCH A POINT ONWHICH YOUR FATHER TOOK ME INTO CONFIDENCE BY THE WAY IT WAS THAT VERYEVENING ON WHICH I ONCE BEFORE FULFILLED A MISSION FROM FRED JUSTAFTER HE HAD GONE TO COLLEGE
 MR
 GARTH TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED ON THENIGHT OF FEATHERSTONES DEATHHOW YOU REFUSED TO BURN THE WILL AND HESAID THAT YOU HAD SOME HEARTPRICKINGS ON THAT SUBJECT BECAUSE YOU HADBEEN THE INNOCENT MEANS OF HINDERING FRED FROM GETTING HIS TEN THOUSANDPOUNDS
 I HAVE KEPT THAT IN MIND AND I HAVE HEARD SOMETHING THAT MAYRELIEVE YOU ON THAT SCOREMAY SHOW YOU THAT NO SINOFFERING IS DEMANDEDFROM YOU THERE
MR
 FAREBROTHER PAUSED A MOMENT AND LOOKED AT MARY
 HE MEANT TO GIVEFRED HIS FULL ADVANTAGE BUT IT WOULD BE WELL HE THOUGHT TO CLEAR HERMIND OF ANY SUPERSTITIONS SUCH AS WOMEN SOMETIMES FOLLOW WHEN THEY DOA MAN THE WRONG OF MARRYING HIM AS AN ACT OF ATONEMENT
 MARYS CHEEKSHAD BEGUN TO BURN A LITTLE AND SHE WAS MUTE
I MEAN THAT YOUR ACTION MADE NO REAL DIFFERENCE TO FREDS LOT
 I FINDTHAT THE FIRST WILL WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LEGALLY GOOD AFTER THE BURNINGOF THE LAST IT WOULD NOT HAVE STOOD IF IT HAD BEEN DISPUTED AND YOUMAY BE SURE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISPUTED
 SO ON THAT SCORE YOU MAYFEEL YOUR MIND FREE
THANK YOU MR
 FAREBROTHER SAID MARY EARNESTLY
 I AM GRATEFUL TOYOU FOR REMEMBERING MY FEELINGS
WELL NOW I MAY GO ON
 FRED YOU KNOW HAS TAKEN HIS DEGREE
 HE HASWORKED HIS WAY SO FAR AND NOW THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS HE TO DO
 THATQUESTION IS SO DIFFICULT THAT HE IS INCLINED TO FOLLOW HIS FATHERSWISHES AND ENTER THE CHURCH THOUGH YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I DO THAT HEWAS QUITE SET AGAINST THAT FORMERLY
 I HAVE QUESTIONED HIM ON THESUBJECT AND I CONFESS I SEE NO INSUPERABLE OBJECTION TO HIS BEING ACLERGYMAN AS THINGS GO
 HE SAYS THAT HE COULD TURN HIS MIND TO DOINGHIS BEST IN THAT VOCATION ON ONE CONDITION
 IF THAT CONDITION WEREFULFILLED I WOULD DO MY UTMOST IN HELPING FRED ON
 AFTER A TIMENOT OFCOURSE AT FIRSTHE MIGHT BE WITH ME AS MY CURATE AND HE WOULD HAVE SOMUCH TO DO THAT HIS STIPEND WOULD BE NEARLY WHAT I USED TO GET ASVICAR
 BUT I REPEAT THAT THERE IS A CONDITION WITHOUT WHICH ALL THISGOOD CANNOT COME TO PASS
 HE HAS OPENED HIS HEART TO ME MISS GARTHAND ASKED ME TO PLEAD FOR HIM
 THE CONDITION LIES ENTIRELY IN YOURFEELING
MARY LOOKED SO MUCH MOVED THAT HE SAID AFTER A MOMENT LET US WALK ALITTLE AND WHEN THEY WERE WALKING HE ADDED TO SPEAK QUITE PLAINLYFRED WILL NOT TAKE ANY COURSE WHICH WOULD LESSEN THE CHANCE THAT YOUWOULD CONSENT TO BE HIS WIFE BUT WITH THAT PROSPECT HE WILL TRY HISBEST AT ANYTHING YOU APPROVE
I CANNOT POSSIBLY SAY THAT I WILL EVER BE HIS WIFE MR
 FAREBROTHERBUT I CERTAINLY NEVER WILL BE HIS WIFE IF HE BECOMES A CLERGYMAN
 WHATYOU SAY IS MOST GENEROUS AND KIND I DONT MEAN FOR A MOMENT TO CORRECTYOUR JUDGMENT
 IT IS ONLY THAT I HAVE MY GIRLISH MOCKING WAY OFLOOKING AT THINGS SAID MARY WITH A RETURNING SPARKLE OF PLAYFULNESSIN HER ANSWER WHICH ONLY MADE ITS MODESTY MORE CHARMING
HE WISHES ME TO REPORT EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK SAID MR
 FAREBROTHER
I COULD NOT LOVE A MAN WHO IS RIDICULOUS SAID MARY NOT CHOOSING TOGO DEEPER
 FRED HAS SENSE AND KNOWLEDGE ENOUGH TO MAKE HIMRESPECTABLE IF HE LIKES IN SOME GOOD WORLDLY BUSINESS BUT I CANNEVER IMAGINE HIM PREACHING AND EXHORTING AND PRONOUNCING BLESSINGSAND PRAYING BY THE SICK WITHOUT FEELING AS IF I WERE LOOKING AT ACARICATURE
 HIS BEING A CLERGYMAN WOULD BE ONLY FOR GENTILITYS SAKEAND I THINK THERE IS NOTHING MORE CONTEMPTIBLE THAN SUCH IMBECILEGENTILITY
 I USED TO THINK THAT OF MR
 CROWSE WITH HIS EMPTY FACE ANDNEAT UMBRELLA AND MINCING LITTLE SPEECHES
 WHAT RIGHT HAVE SUCH MEN TOREPRESENT CHRISTIANITYAS IF IT WERE AN INSTITUTION FOR GETTING UPIDIOTS GENTEELLYAS IF MARY CHECKED HERSELF
 SHE HAD BEEN CARRIEDALONG AS IF SHE HAD BEEN SPEAKING TO FRED INSTEAD OF MR
 FAREBROTHER
YOUNG WOMEN ARE SEVERE THEY DONT FEEL THE STRESS OF ACTION AS MENDO THOUGH PERHAPS I OUGHT TO MAKE YOU AN EXCEPTION THERE
 BUT YOUDONT PUT FRED VINCY ON SO LOW A LEVEL AS THAT
NO INDEED HE HAS PLENTY OF SENSE BUT I THINK HE WOULD NOT SHOW ITAS A CLERGYMAN
 HE WOULD BE A PIECE OF PROFESSIONAL AFFECTATION
THEN THE ANSWER IS QUITE DECIDED
 AS A CLERGYMAN HE COULD HAVE NOHOPE
MARY SHOOK HER HEAD
BUT IF HE BRAVED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES OF GETTING HIS BREAD IN SOMEOTHER WAYWILL YOU GIVE HIM THE SUPPORT OF HOPE
 MAY HE COUNT ONWINNING YOU
I THINK FRED OUGHT NOT TO NEED TELLING AGAIN WHAT I HAVE ALREADY SAIDTO HIM MARY ANSWERED WITH A SLIGHT RESENTMENT IN HER MANNER
 I MEANTHAT HE OUGHT NOT TO PUT SUCH QUESTIONS UNTIL HE HAS DONE SOMETHINGWORTHY INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT HE COULD DO IT
MR
 FAREBROTHER WAS SILENT FOR A MINUTE OR MORE AND THEN AS THEYTURNED AND PAUSED UNDER THE SHADOW OF A MAPLE AT THE END OF A GRASSYWALK SAID I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU RESIST ANY ATTEMPT TO FETTER YOUBUT EITHER YOUR FEELING FOR FRED VINCY EXCLUDES YOUR ENTERTAININGANOTHER ATTACHMENT OR IT DOES NOT EITHER HE MAY COUNT ON YOURREMAINING SINGLE UNTIL HE SHALL HAVE EARNED YOUR HAND OR HE MAY IN ANYCASE BE DISAPPOINTED
 PARDON ME MARYYOU KNOW I USED TO CATECHISE YOUUNDER THAT NAMEBUT WHEN THE STATE OF A WOMANS AFFECTIONS TOUCHES THEHAPPINESS OF ANOTHER LIFEOF MORE LIVES THAN ONEI THINK IT WOULD BETHE NOBLER COURSE FOR HER TO BE PERFECTLY DIRECT AND OPEN
MARY IN HER TURN WAS SILENT WONDERING NOT AT MR
 FAREBROTHERS MANNERBUT AT HIS TONE WHICH HAD A GRAVE RESTRAINED EMOTION IN IT
 WHEN THESTRANGE IDEA FLASHED ACROSS HER THAT HIS WORDS HAD REFERENCE TOHIMSELF SHE WAS INCREDULOUS AND ASHAMED OF ENTERTAINING IT
 SHE HADNEVER THOUGHT THAT ANY MAN COULD LOVE HER EXCEPT FRED WHO HAD ESPOUSEDHER WITH THE UMBRELLA RING WHEN SHE WORE SOCKS AND LITTLE STRAPPEDSHOES STILL LESS THAT SHE COULD BE OF ANY IMPORTANCE TO MR
FAREBROTHER THE CLEVEREST MAN IN HER NARROW CIRCLE
 SHE HAD ONLY TIMETO FEEL THAT ALL THIS WAS HAZY AND PERHAPS ILLUSORY BUT ONE THING WASCLEAR AND DETERMINEDHER ANSWER
SINCE YOU THINK IT MY DUTY MR
 FAREBROTHER I WILL TELL YOU THAT IHAVE TOO STRONG A FEELING FOR FRED TO GIVE HIM UP FOR ANY ONE ELSE
 ISHOULD NEVER BE QUITE HAPPY IF I THOUGHT HE WAS UNHAPPY FOR THE LOSS OFME
 IT HAS TAKEN SUCH DEEP ROOT IN MEMY GRATITUDE TO HIM FOR ALWAYSLOVING ME BEST AND MINDING SO MUCH IF I HURT MYSELF FROM THE TIMEWHEN WE WERE VERY LITTLE
 I CANNOT IMAGINE ANY NEW FEELING COMING TOMAKE THAT WEAKER
 I SHOULD LIKE BETTER THAN ANYTHING TO SEE HIM WORTHYOF EVERY ONES RESPECT
 BUT PLEASE TELL HIM I WILL NOT PROMISE TO MARRYHIM TILL THEN I SHOULD SHAME AND GRIEVE MY FATHER AND MOTHER
 HE ISFREE TO CHOOSE SOME ONE ELSE
THEN I HAVE FULFILLED MY COMMISSION THOROUGHLY SAID MR
 FAREBROTHERPUTTING OUT HIS HAND TO MARY AND I SHALL RIDE BACK TO MIDDLEMARCHFORTHWITH
 WITH THIS PROSPECT BEFORE HIM WE SHALL GET FRED INTO THERIGHT NICHE SOMEHOW AND I HOPE I SHALL LIVE TO JOIN YOUR HANDS
 GODBLESS YOU
OH PLEASE STAY AND LET ME GIVE YOU SOME TEA SAID MARY
 HER EYESFILLED WITH TEARS FOR SOMETHING INDEFINABLE SOMETHING LIKE THERESOLUTE SUPPRESSION OF A PAIN IN MR
 FAREBROTHERS MANNER MADE HERFEEL SUDDENLY MISERABLE AS SHE HAD ONCE FELT WHEN SHE SAW HER FATHERSHANDS TREMBLING IN A MOMENT OF TROUBLE
NO MY DEAR NO
 I MUST GET BACK
IN THREE MINUTES THE VICAR WAS ON HORSEBACK AGAIN HAVING GONEMAGNANIMOUSLY THROUGH A DUTY MUCH HARDER THAN THE RENUNCIATION OFWHIST OR EVEN THAN THE WRITING OF PENITENTIAL MEDITATIONS
CHAPTER LIII
IT IS BUT A SHALLOW HASTE WHICH CONCLUDETH INSINCERITY FROM WHATOUTSIDERS CALL INCONSISTENCYPUTTING A DEAD MECHANISM OF IFS ANDTHEREFORES FOR THE LIVING MYRIAD OF HIDDEN SUCKERS WHEREBY THE BELIEFAND THE CONDUCT ARE WROUGHT INTO MUTUAL SUSTAINMENT
MR
 BULSTRODE WHEN HE WAS HOPING TO ACQUIRE A NEW INTEREST IN LOWICKHAD NATURALLY HAD AN ESPECIAL WISH THAT THE NEW CLERGYMAN SHOULD BE ONEWHOM HE THOROUGHLY APPROVED AND HE BELIEVED IT TO BE A CHASTISEMENTAND ADMONITION DIRECTED TO HIS OWN SHORTCOMINGS AND THOSE OF THE NATIONAT LARGE THAT JUST ABOUT THE TIME WHEN HE CAME IN POSSESSION OF THEDEEDS WHICH MADE HIM THE PROPRIETOR OF STONE COURT MR
 FAREBROTHERREAD HIMSELF INTO THE QUAINT LITTLE CHURCH AND PREACHED HIS FIRSTSERMON TO THE CONGREGATION OF FARMERS LABORERS AND VILLAGE ARTISANS
IT WAS NOT THAT MR
 BULSTRODE INTENDED TO FREQUENT LOWICK CHURCH OR TORESIDE AT STONE COURT FOR A GOOD WHILE TO COME HE HAD BOUGHT THEEXCELLENT FARM AND FINE HOMESTEAD SIMPLY AS A RETREAT WHICH HE MIGHTGRADUALLY ENLARGE AS TO THE LAND AND BEAUTIFY AS TO THE DWELLING UNTILIT SHOULD BE CONDUCIVE TO THE DIVINE GLORY THAT HE SHOULD ENTER ON ITAS A RESIDENCE PARTIALLY WITHDRAWING FROM HIS PRESENT EXERTIONS IN THEADMINISTRATION OF BUSINESS AND THROWING MORE CONSPICUOUSLY ON THE SIDEOF GOSPEL TRUTH THE WEIGHT OF LOCAL LANDED PROPRIETORSHIP WHICHPROVIDENCE MIGHT INCREASE BY UNFORESEEN OCCASIONS OF PURCHASE
 A STRONGLEADING IN THIS DIRECTION SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN IN THE SURPRISINGFACILITY OF GETTING STONE COURT WHEN EVERY ONE HAD EXPECTED THAT MR
RIGG FEATHERSTONE WOULD HAVE CLUNG TO IT AS THE GARDEN OF EDEN
 THATWAS WHAT POOR OLD PETER HIMSELF HAD EXPECTED HAVING OFTEN INIMAGINATION LOOKED UP THROUGH THE SODS ABOVE HIM AND UNOBSTRUCTED BYPERSPECTIVE SEEN HIS FROGFACED LEGATEE ENJOYING THE FINE OLD PLACE TOTHE PERPETUAL SURPRISE AND DISAPPOINTMENT OF OTHER SURVIVORS
BUT HOW LITTLE WE KNOW WHAT WOULD MAKE PARADISE FOR OUR NEIGHBORS
 WEJUDGE FROM OUR OWN DESIRES AND OUR NEIGHBORS THEMSELVES ARE NOT ALWAYSOPEN ENOUGH EVEN TO THROW OUT A HINT OF THEIRS
 THE COOL AND JUDICIOUSJOSHUA RIGG HAD NOT ALLOWED HIS PARENT TO PERCEIVE THAT STONE COURT WASANYTHING LESS THAN THE CHIEF GOOD IN HIS ESTIMATION AND HE HADCERTAINLY WISHED TO CALL IT HIS OWN
 BUT AS WARREN HASTINGS LOOKED ATGOLD AND THOUGHT OF BUYING DAYLESFORD SO JOSHUA RIGG LOOKED AT STONECOURT AND THOUGHT OF BUYING GOLD
 HE HAD A VERY DISTINCT AND INTENSEVISION OF HIS CHIEF GOOD THE VIGOROUS GREED WHICH HE HAD INHERITEDHAVING TAKEN A SPECIAL FORM BY DINT OF CIRCUMSTANCE AND HIS CHIEF GOODWAS TO BE A MONEYCHANGER
 FROM HIS EARLIEST EMPLOYMENT AS AN ERRANDBOYIN A SEAPORT HE HAD LOOKED THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE MONEYCHANGERS ASOTHER BOYS LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE PASTRYCOOKS THEFASCINATION HAD WROUGHT ITSELF GRADUALLY INTO A DEEP SPECIAL PASSIONHE MEANT WHEN HE HAD PROPERTY TO DO MANY THINGS ONE OF THEM BEING TOMARRY A GENTEEL YOUNG PERSON BUT THESE WERE ALL ACCIDENTS AND JOYSTHAT IMAGINATION COULD DISPENSE WITH
 THE ONE JOY AFTER WHICH HIS SOULTHIRSTED WAS TO HAVE A MONEYCHANGERS SHOP ON A MUCHFREQUENTED QUAYTO HAVE LOCKS ALL ROUND HIM OF WHICH HE HELD THE KEYS AND TO LOOKSUBLIMELY COOL AS HE HANDLED THE BREEDING COINS OF ALL NATIONS WHILEHELPLESS CUPIDITY LOOKED AT HIM ENVIOUSLY FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF ANIRON LATTICE
 THE STRENGTH OF THAT PASSION HAD BEEN A POWER ENABLINGHIM TO MASTER ALL THE KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY TO GRATIFY IT
 AND WHENOTHERS WERE THINKING THAT HE HAD SETTLED AT STONE COURT FOR LIFEJOSHUA HIMSELF WAS THINKING THAT THE MOMENT NOW WAS NOT FAR OFF WHEN HESHOULD SETTLE ON THE NORTH QUAY WITH THE BEST APPOINTMENTS IN SAFES ANDLOCKS
ENOUGH
 WE ARE CONCERNED WITH LOOKING AT JOSHUA RIGGS SALE OF HIS LANDFROM MR
 BULSTRODES POINT OF VIEW AND HE INTERPRETED IT AS A CHEERINGDISPENSATION CONVEYING PERHAPS A SANCTION TO A PURPOSE WHICH HE HAD FORSOME TIME ENTERTAINED WITHOUT EXTERNAL ENCOURAGEMENT HE INTERPRETED ITTHUS BUT NOT TOO CONFIDENTLY OFFERING UP HIS THANKSGIVING IN GUARDEDPHRASEOLOGY
 HIS DOUBTS DID NOT ARISE FROM THE POSSIBLE RELATIONS OFTHE EVENT TO JOSHUA RIGGS DESTINY WHICH BELONGED TO THE UNMAPPEDREGIONS NOT TAKEN UNDER THE PROVIDENTIAL GOVERNMENT EXCEPT PERHAPS INAN IMPERFECT COLONIAL WAY BUT THEY AROSE FROM REFLECTING THAT THISDISPENSATION TOO MIGHT BE A CHASTISEMENT FOR HIMSELF AS MR
FAREBROTHERS INDUCTION TO THE LIVING CLEARLY WAS
THIS WAS NOT WHAT MR
 BULSTRODE SAID TO ANY MAN FOR THE SAKE OFDECEIVING HIM IT WAS WHAT HE SAID TO HIMSELFIT WAS AS GENUINELY HISMODE OF EXPLAINING EVENTS AS ANY THEORY OF YOURS MAY BE IF YOU HAPPENTO DISAGREE WITH HIM
 FOR THE EGOISM WHICH ENTERS INTO OUR THEORIESDOES NOT AFFECT THEIR SINCERITY RATHER THE MORE OUR EGOISM ISSATISFIED THE MORE ROBUST IS OUR BELIEF
HOWEVER WHETHER FOR SANCTION OR FOR CHASTISEMENT MR
 BULSTRODEHARDLY FIFTEEN MONTHS AFTER THE DEATH OF PETER FEATHERSTONE HAD BECOMETHE PROPRIETOR OF STONE COURT AND WHAT PETER WOULD SAY IF HE WEREWORTHY TO KNOW HAD BECOME AN INEXHAUSTIBLE AND CONSOLATORY SUBJECT OFCONVERSATION TO HIS DISAPPOINTED RELATIVES
 THE TABLES WERE NOW TURNEDON THAT DEAR BROTHER DEPARTED AND TO CONTEMPLATE THE FRUSTRATION OFHIS CUNNING BY THE SUPERIOR CUNNING OF THINGS IN GENERAL WAS A CUD OFDELIGHT TO SOLOMON
 MRS
 WAULE HAD A MELANCHOLY TRIUMPH IN THE PROOFTHAT IT DID NOT ANSWER TO MAKE FALSE FEATHERSTONES AND CUT OFF THEGENUINE AND SISTER MARTHA RECEIVING THE NEWS IN THE CHALKY FLATS SAIDDEAR DEAR
 THEN THE ALMIGHTY COULD HAVE BEEN NONE SO PLEASED WITH THEALMSHOUSES AFTER ALL
AFFECTIONATE MRS
 BULSTRODE WAS PARTICULARLY GLAD OF THE ADVANTAGEWHICH HER HUSBANDS HEALTH WAS LIKELY TO GET FROM THE PURCHASE OF STONECOURT
 FEW DAYS PASSED WITHOUT HIS RIDING THITHER AND LOOKING OVER SOMEPART OF THE FARM WITH THE BAILIFF AND THE EVENINGS WERE DELICIOUS INTHAT QUIET SPOT WHEN THE NEW HAYRICKS LATELY SET UP WERE SENDINGFORTH ODORS TO MINGLE WITH THE BREATH OF THE RICH OLD GARDEN
 ONEEVENING WHILE THE SUN WAS STILL ABOVE THE HORIZON AND BURNING INGOLDEN LAMPS AMONG THE GREAT WALNUT BOUGHS MR
 BULSTRODE WAS PAUSINGON HORSEBACK OUTSIDE THE FRONT GATE WAITING FOR CALEB GARTH WHO HADMET HIM BY APPOINTMENT TO GIVE AN OPINION ON A QUESTION OF STABLEDRAINAGE AND WAS NOW ADVISING THE BAILIFF IN THE RICKYARD
MR
 BULSTRODE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BEING IN A GOOD SPIRITUAL FRAME AND MORETHAN USUALLY SERENE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HIS INNOCENT RECREATION
 HEWAS DOCTRINALLY CONVINCED THAT THERE WAS A TOTAL ABSENCE OF MERIT INHIMSELF BUT THAT DOCTRINAL CONVICTION MAY BE HELD WITHOUT PAIN WHENTHE SENSE OF DEMERIT DOES NOT TAKE A DISTINCT SHAPE IN MEMORY ANDREVIVE THE TINGLING OF SHAME OR THE PANG OF REMORSE
 NAY IT MAY BEHELD WITH INTENSE SATISFACTION WHEN THE DEPTH OF OUR SINNING IS BUT AMEASURE FOR THE DEPTH OF FORGIVENESS AND A CLENCHING PROOF THAT WE AREPECULIAR INSTRUMENTS OF THE DIVINE INTENTION
 THE MEMORY HAS AS MANYMOODS AS THE TEMPER AND SHIFTS ITS SCENERY LIKE A DIORAMA
 AT THISMOMENT MR
 BULSTRODE FELT AS IF THE SUNSHINE WERE ALL ONE WITH THAT OFFAROFF EVENINGS WHEN HE WAS A VERY YOUNG MAN AND USED TO GO OUTPREACHING BEYOND HIGHBURY
 AND HE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE HAD THAT SERVICEOF EXHORTATION IN PROSPECT NOW
 THE TEXTS WERE THERE STILL AND SO WASHIS OWN FACILITY IN EXPOUNDING THEM
 HIS BRIEF REVERIE WAS INTERRUPTEDBY THE RETURN OF CALEB GARTH WHO ALSO WAS ON HORSEBACK AND WAS JUSTSHAKING HIS BRIDLE BEFORE STARTING WHEN HE EXCLAIMEDBLESS MY HEART
 WHATS THIS FELLOW IN BLACK COMING ALONG THE LANE
HES LIKE ONE OF THOSE MEN ONE SEES ABOUT AFTER THE RACES
MR
 BULSTRODE TURNED HIS HORSE AND LOOKED ALONG THE LANE BUT MADE NOREPLY
 THE COMER WAS OUR SLIGHT ACQUAINTANCE MR
 RAFFLES WHOSEAPPEARANCE PRESENTED NO OTHER CHANGE THAN SUCH AS WAS DUE TO A SUIT OFBLACK AND A CRAPE HATBAND
 HE WAS WITHIN THREE YARDS OF THE HORSEMANNOW AND THEY COULD SEE THE FLASH OF RECOGNITION IN HIS FACE AS HEWHIRLED HIS STICK UPWARD LOOKING ALL THE WHILE AT MR
 BULSTRODE ANDAT LAST EXCLAIMINGBY JOVE NICK ITS YOU
 I COULDNT BE MISTAKEN THOUGH THEFIVEANDTWENTY YEARS HAVE PLAYED OLD BOGUY WITH US BOTH
 HOW ARE YOUEH
 YOU DIDNT EXPECT TO SEE ME HERE
 COME SHAKE US BY THE HAND
 TOSAY THAT MR
 RAFFLES MANNER WAS RATHER EXCITED WOULD BE ONLY ONE MODEOF SAYING THAT IT WAS EVENING
 CALEB GARTH COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS AMOMENT OF STRUGGLE AND HESITATION IN MR
 BULSTRODE BUT IT ENDED IN HISPUTTING OUT HIS HAND COLDLY TO RAFFLES AND SAYINGI DID NOT INDEED EXPECT TO SEE YOU IN THIS REMOTE COUNTRY PLACE
WELL IT BELONGS TO A STEPSON OF MINE SAID RAFFLES ADJUSTINGHIMSELF IN A SWAGGERING ATTITUDE
 I CAME TO SEE HIM HERE BEFORE
 IMNOT SO SURPRISED AT SEEING YOU OLD FELLOW BECAUSE I PICKED UP ALETTERWHAT YOU MAY CALL A PROVIDENTIAL THING
 ITS UNCOMMONLYFORTUNATE I MET YOU THOUGH FOR I DONT CARE ABOUT SEEING MY STEPSONHES NOT AFFECTIONATE AND HIS POOR MOTHERS GONE NOW
 TO TELL THETRUTH I CAME OUT OF LOVE TO YOU NICK I CAME TO GET YOUR ADDRESSFORLOOK HERE
 RAFFLES DREW A CRUMPLED PAPER FROM HIS POCKET
ALMOST ANY OTHER MAN THAN CALEB GARTH MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO LINGERON THE SPOT FOR THE SAKE OF HEARING ALL HE COULD ABOUT A MAN WHOSEACQUAINTANCE WITH BULSTRODE SEEMED TO IMPLY PASSAGES IN THE BANKERSLIFE SO UNLIKE ANYTHING THAT WAS KNOWN OF HIM IN MIDDLEMARCH THAT THEYMUST HAVE THE NATURE OF A SECRET TO PIQUE CURIOSITY
 BUT CALEB WASPECULIAR CERTAIN HUMAN TENDENCIES WHICH ARE COMMONLY STRONG WEREALMOST ABSENT FROM HIS MIND AND ONE OF THESE WAS CURIOSITY ABOUTPERSONAL AFFAIRS
 ESPECIALLY IF THERE WAS ANYTHING DISCREDITABLE TO BEFOUND OUT CONCERNING ANOTHER MAN CALEB PREFERRED NOT TO KNOW IT ANDIF HE HAD TO TELL ANYBODY UNDER HIM THAT HIS EVIL DOINGS WEREDISCOVERED HE WAS MORE EMBARRASSED THAN THE CULPRIT
 HE NOW SPURREDHIS HORSE AND SAYING I WISH YOU GOOD EVENING MR
 BULSTRODE I MUSTBE GETTING HOME SET OFF AT A TROT
YOU DIDNT PUT YOUR FULL ADDRESS TO THIS LETTER RAFFLES CONTINUED
THAT WAS NOT LIKE THE FIRSTRATE MAN OF BUSINESS YOU USED TO BE
 THESHRUBSTHEY MAY BE ANYWHERE YOU LIVE NEAR AT HAND EH
HAVE CUT THELONDON CONCERN ALTOGETHERPERHAPS TURNED COUNTRY SQUIREHAVE A RURALMANSION TO INVITE ME TO
 LORD HOW MANY YEARS IT IS AGO
 THE OLD LADYMUST HAVE BEEN DEAD A PRETTY LONG WHILEGONE TO GLORY WITHOUT THE PAINOF KNOWING HOW POOR HER DAUGHTER WAS EH
 BUT BY JOVE
 YOURE VERYPALE AND PASTY NICK
 COME IF YOURE GOING HOME ILL WALK BY YOURSIDE
MR
 BULSTRODES USUAL PALENESS HAD IN FACT TAKEN AN ALMOST DEATHLY HUE
FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE EXPANSE OF HIS LIFE HAD BEEN SUBMERGED IN ITSEVENING SUNSHINE WHICH SHONE BACKWARD TO ITS REMEMBERED MORNING SINSEEMED TO BE A QUESTION OF DOCTRINE AND INWARD PENITENCE HUMILIATIONAN EXERCISE OF THE CLOSET THE BEARING OF HIS DEEDS A MATTER OF PRIVATEVISION ADJUSTED SOLELY BY SPIRITUAL RELATIONS AND CONCEPTIONS OF THEDIVINE PURPOSES
 AND NOW AS IF BY SOME HIDEOUS MAGIC THIS LOUD REDFIGURE HAD RISEN BEFORE HIM IN UNMANAGEABLE SOLIDITYAN INCORPORATEPAST WHICH HAD NOT ENTERED INTO HIS IMAGINATION OF CHASTISEMENTS
 BUTMR
 BULSTRODES THOUGHT WAS BUSY AND HE WAS NOT A MAN TO ACT OR SPEAKRASHLY
I WAS GOING HOME HE SAID BUT I CAN DEFER MY RIDE A LITTLE
 AND YOUCAN IF YOU PLEASE REST HERE
THANK YOU SAID RAFFLES MAKING A GRIMACE
 I DONT CARE NOW ABOUTSEEING MY STEPSON
 ID RATHER GO HOME WITH YOU
YOUR STEPSON IF MR
 RIGG FEATHERSTONE WAS HE IS HERE NO LONGER
 I AMMASTER HERE NOW
RAFFLES OPENED WIDE EYES AND GAVE A LONG WHISTLE OF SURPRISE BEFOREHE SAID WELL THEN IVE NO OBJECTION
 IVE HAD ENOUGH WALKING FROMTHE COACHROAD
 I NEVER WAS MUCH OF A WALKER OR RIDER EITHER
 WHAT ILIKE IS A SMART VEHICLE AND A SPIRITED COB
 I WAS ALWAYS A LITTLE HEAVYIN THE SADDLE
 WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE IT MUST BE TO YOU TO SEE MEOLD FELLOW
 HE CONTINUED AS THEY TURNED TOWARDS THE HOUSE
 YOU DONTSAY SO BUT YOU NEVER TOOK YOUR LUCK HEARTILYYOU WERE ALWAYS THINKINGOF IMPROVING THE OCCASIONYOUD SUCH A GIFT FOR IMPROVING YOUR LUCK
MR
 RAFFLES SEEMED GREATLY TO ENJOY HIS OWN WIT AND SWUNG HIS LEG IN ASWAGGERING MANNER WHICH WAS RATHER TOO MUCH FOR HIS COMPANIONSJUDICIOUS PATIENCE
IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY MR
 BULSTRODE OBSERVED WITH CHILL ANGER OURACQUAINTANCE MANY YEARS AGO HAD NOT THE SORT OF INTIMACY WHICH YOU ARENOW ASSUMING MR
 RAFFLES
 ANY SERVICES YOU DESIRE OF ME WILL BE THEMORE READILY RENDERED IF YOU WILL AVOID A TONE OF FAMILIARITY WHICH DIDNOT LIE IN OUR FORMER INTERCOURSE AND CAN HARDLY BE WARRANTED BY MORETHAN TWENTY YEARS OF SEPARATION
YOU DONT LIKE BEING CALLED NICK
 WHY I ALWAYS CALLED YOU NICK IN MYHEART AND THOUGH LOST TO SIGHT TO MEMORY DEAR
 BY JOVE
 MY FEELINGSHAVE RIPENED FOR YOU LIKE FINE OLD COGNAC
 I HOPE YOUVE GOT SOME INTHE HOUSE NOW
 JOSH FILLED MY FLASK WELL THE LAST TIME
MR
 BULSTRODE HAD NOT YET FULLY LEARNED THAT EVEN THE DESIRE FOR COGNACWAS NOT STRONGER IN RAFFLES THAN THE DESIRE TO TORMENT AND THAT A HINTOF ANNOYANCE ALWAYS SERVED HIM AS A FRESH CUE
 BUT IT WAS AT LEASTCLEAR THAT FURTHER OBJECTION WAS USELESS AND MR
 BULSTRODE IN GIVINGORDERS TO THE HOUSEKEEPER FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF THE GUEST HAD ARESOLUTE AIR OF QUIETUDE
THERE WAS THE COMFORT OF THINKING THAT THIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD BEEN IN THESERVICE OF RIGG ALSO AND MIGHT ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT MR
 BULSTRODEENTERTAINED RAFFLES MERELY AS A FRIEND OF HER FORMER MASTER
WHEN THERE WAS FOOD AND DRINK SPREAD BEFORE HIS VISITOR IN THEWAINSCOTED PARLOR AND NO WITNESS IN THE ROOM MR
 BULSTRODE SAIDYOUR HABITS AND MINE ARE SO DIFFERENT MR
 RAFFLES THAT WE CAN HARDLYENJOY EACH OTHERS SOCIETY
 THE WISEST PLAN FOR BOTH OF US WILLTHEREFORE BE TO PART AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
 SINCE YOU SAY THAT YOU WISHEDTO MEET ME YOU PROBABLY CONSIDERED THAT YOU HAD SOME BUSINESS TOTRANSACT WITH ME
 BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I WILL INVITE YOU TOREMAIN HERE FOR THE NIGHT AND I WILL MYSELF RIDE OVER HERE EARLYTOMORROW MORNINGBEFORE BREAKFAST IN FACTWHEN I CAN RECEIVE ANYCOMMUNICATION YOU HAVE TO MAKE TO ME
WITH ALL MY HEART SAID RAFFLES THIS IS A COMFORTABLE PLACEALITTLE DULL FOR A CONTINUANCE BUT I CAN PUT UP WITH IT FOR A NIGHTWITH THIS GOOD LIQUOR AND THE PROSPECT OF SEEING YOU AGAIN IN THEMORNING
 YOURE A MUCH BETTER HOST THAN MY STEPSON WAS BUT JOSH OWEDME A BIT OF A GRUDGE FOR MARRYING HIS MOTHER AND BETWEEN YOU AND METHERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING BUT KINDNESS
MR
 BULSTRODE HOPING THAT THE PECULIAR MIXTURE OF JOVIALITY ANDSNEERING IN RAFFLES MANNER WAS A GOOD DEAL THE EFFECT OF DRINK HADDETERMINED TO WAIT TILL HE WAS QUITE SOBER BEFORE HE SPENT MORE WORDSUPON HIM
 BUT HE RODE HOME WITH A TERRIBLY LUCID VISION OF THEDIFFICULTY THERE WOULD BE IN ARRANGING ANY RESULT THAT COULD BEPERMANENTLY COUNTED ON WITH THIS MAN
 IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT HE SHOULDWISH TO GET RID OF JOHN RAFFLES THOUGH HIS REAPPEARANCE COULD NOT BEREGARDED AS LYING OUTSIDE THE DIVINE PLAN
 THE SPIRIT OF EVIL MIGHTHAVE SENT HIM TO THREATEN MR
 BULSTRODES SUBVERSION AS AN INSTRUMENTOF GOOD BUT THE THREAT MUST HAVE BEEN PERMITTED AND WAS ACHASTISEMENT OF A NEW KIND
 IT WAS AN HOUR OF ANGUISH FOR HIM VERYDIFFERENT FROM THE HOURS IN WHICH HIS STRUGGLE HAD BEEN SECURELYPRIVATE AND WHICH HAD ENDED WITH A SENSE THAT HIS SECRET MISDEEDS WEREPARDONED AND HIS SERVICES ACCEPTED
 THOSE MISDEEDS EVEN WHENCOMMITTEDHAD THEY NOT BEEN HALF SANCTIFIED BY THE SINGLENESS OF HISDESIRE TO DEVOTE HIMSELF AND ALL HE POSSESSED TO THE FURTHERANCE OF THEDIVINE SCHEME
 AND WAS HE AFTER ALL TO BECOME A MERE STONE OF STUMBLINGAND A ROCK OF OFFENCE
 FOR WHO WOULD UNDERSTAND THE WORK WITHIN HIM
WHO WOULD NOT WHEN THERE WAS THE PRETEXT OF CASTING DISGRACE UPON HIMCONFOUND HIS WHOLE LIFE AND THE TRUTHS HE HAD ESPOUSED IN ONE HEAP OFOBLOQUY
IN HIS CLOSEST MEDITATIONS THE LIFELONG HABIT OF MR
 BULSTRODES MINDCLAD HIS MOST EGOISTIC TERRORS IN DOCTRINAL REFERENCES TO SUPERHUMANENDS
 BUT EVEN WHILE WE ARE TALKING AND MEDITATING ABOUT THE EARTHSORBIT AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM WHAT WE FEEL AND ADJUST OUR MOVEMENTS TO ISTHE STABLE EARTH AND THE CHANGING DAY
 AND NOW WITHIN ALL THE AUTOMATICSUCCESSION OF THEORETIC PHRASESDISTINCT AND INMOST AS THE SHIVER ANDTHE ACHE OF ONCOMING FEVER WHEN WE ARE DISCUSSING ABSTRACT PAIN WASTHE FORECAST OF DISGRACE IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS NEIGHBORS AND OF HISOWN WIFE
 FOR THE PAIN AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC ESTIMATE OF DISGRACEDEPENDS ON THE AMOUNT OF PREVIOUS PROFESSION
 TO MEN WHO ONLY AIM ATESCAPING FELONY NOTHING SHORT OF THE PRISONERS DOCK IS DISGRACE
 BUTMR
 BULSTRODE HAD AIMED AT BEING AN EMINENT CHRISTIAN
IT WAS NOT MORE THAN HALFPAST SEVEN IN THE MORNING WHEN HE AGAINREACHED STONE COURT
 THE FINE OLD PLACE NEVER LOOKED MORE LIKE ADELIGHTFUL HOME THAN AT THAT MOMENT THE GREAT WHITE LILIES WERE INFLOWER THE NASTURTIUMS THEIR PRETTY LEAVES ALL SILVERED WITH DEWWERE RUNNING AWAY OVER THE LOW STONE WALL THE VERY NOISES ALL AROUNDHAD A HEART OF PEACE WITHIN THEM
 BUT EVERYTHING WAS SPOILED FOR THEOWNER AS HE WALKED ON THE GRAVEL IN FRONT AND AWAITED THE DESCENT OFMR
 RAFFLES WITH WHOM HE WAS CONDEMNED TO BREAKFAST
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY WERE SEATED TOGETHER IN THE WAINSCOTEDPARLOR OVER THEIR TEA AND TOAST WHICH WAS AS MUCH AS RAFFLES CARED TOTAKE AT THAT EARLY HOUR
 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIS MORNING AND EVENINGSELF WAS NOT SO GREAT AS HIS COMPANION HAD IMAGINED THAT IT MIGHT BETHE DELIGHT IN TORMENTING WAS PERHAPS EVEN THE STRONGER BECAUSE HISSPIRITS WERE RATHER LESS HIGHLY PITCHED
 CERTAINLY HIS MANNERS SEEMEDMORE DISAGREEABLE BY THE MORNING LIGHT
AS I HAVE LITTLE TIME TO SPARE MR
 RAFFLES SAID THE BANKER WHOCOULD HARDLY DO MORE THAN SIP HIS TEA AND BREAK HIS TOAST WITHOUTEATING IT I SHALL BE OBLIGED IF YOU WILL MENTION AT ONCE THE GROUNDON WHICH YOU WISHED TO MEET WITH ME
 I PRESUME THAT YOU HAVE A HOMEELSEWHERE AND WILL BE GLAD TO RETURN TO IT
WHY IF A MAN HAS GOT ANY HEART DOESNT HE WANT TO SEE AN OLD FRIENDNICK
I MUST CALL YOU NICKWE ALWAYS DID CALL YOU YOUNG NICK WHEN WEKNEW YOU MEANT TO MARRY THE OLD WIDOW
 SOME SAID YOU HAD A HANDSOMEFAMILY LIKENESS TO OLD NICK BUT THAT WAS YOUR MOTHERS FAULT CALLINGYOU NICHOLAS
 ARENT YOU GLAD TO SEE ME AGAIN
 I EXPECTED AN INVITE TOSTAY WITH YOU AT SOME PRETTY PLACE
 MY OWN ESTABLISHMENT IS BROKEN UPNOW MY WIFES DEAD
 IVE NO PARTICULAR ATTACHMENT TO ANY SPOT I WOULDAS SOON SETTLE HEREABOUT AS ANYWHERE
MAY I ASK WHY YOU RETURNED FROM AMERICA
 I CONSIDERED THAT THE STRONGWISH YOU EXPRESSED TO GO THERE WHEN AN ADEQUATE SUM WAS FURNISHED WASTANTAMOUNT TO AN ENGAGEMENT THAT YOU WOULD REMAIN THERE FOR LIFE
NEVER KNEW THAT A WISH TO GO TO A PLACE WAS THE SAME THING AS A WISHTO STAY
 BUT I DID STAY A MATTER OF TEN YEARS IT DIDNT SUIT ME TOSTAY ANY LONGER
 AND IM NOT GOING AGAIN NICK
 HERE MR
 RAFFLESWINKED SLOWLY AS HE LOOKED AT MR
 BULSTRODE
DO YOU WISH TO BE SETTLED IN ANY BUSINESS
 WHAT IS YOUR CALLING NOW
THANK YOU MY CALLING IS TO ENJOY MYSELF AS MUCH AS I CAN
 I DONTCARE ABOUT WORKING ANY MORE
 IF I DID ANYTHING IT WOULD BE A LITTLETRAVELLING IN THE TOBACCO LINEOR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT WHICH TAKES AMAN INTO AGREEABLE COMPANY
 BUT NOT WITHOUT AN INDEPENDENCE TO FALLBACK UPON
 THATS WHAT I WANT IM NOT SO STRONG AS I WAS NICK THOUGHIVE GOT MORE COLOR THAN YOU
 I WANT AN INDEPENDENCE
THAT COULD BE SUPPLIED TO YOU IF YOU WOULD ENGAGE TO KEEP AT ADISTANCE SAID MR
 BULSTRODE PERHAPS WITH A LITTLE TOO MUCH EAGERNESSIN HIS UNDERTONE
THAT MUST BE AS IT SUITS MY CONVENIENCE SAID RAFFLES COOLLY
 I SEENO REASON WHY I SHOULDNT MAKE A FEW ACQUAINTANCES HEREABOUT
 IM NOTASHAMED OF MYSELF AS COMPANY FOR ANYBODY
 I DROPPED MY PORTMANTEAU ATTHE TURNPIKE WHEN I GOT DOWNCHANGE OF LINENGENUINEHONOR BRIGHTMORETHAN FRONTS AND WRISTBANDS AND WITH THIS SUIT OF MOURNING STRAPS ANDEVERYTHING I SHOULD DO YOU CREDIT AMONG THE NOBS HERE
 MR
 RAFFLESHAD PUSHED AWAY HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED DOWN AT HIMSELF PARTICULARLY ATHIS STRAPS
 HIS CHIEF INTENTION WAS TO ANNOY BULSTRODE BUT HE REALLYTHOUGHT THAT HIS APPEARANCE NOW WOULD PRODUCE A GOOD EFFECT AND THATHE WAS NOT ONLY HANDSOME AND WITTY BUT CLAD IN A MOURNING STYLE WHICHIMPLIED SOLID CONNECTIONS
IF YOU INTEND TO RELY ON ME IN ANY WAY MR
 RAFFLES SAID BULSTRODEAFTER A MOMENTS PAUSE YOU WILL EXPECT TO MEET MY WISHES
AH TO BE SURE SAID RAFFLES WITH A MOCKING CORDIALITY
 DIDNT IALWAYS DO IT
 LORD YOU MADE A PRETTY THING OUT OF ME AND I GOT BUTLITTLE
 IVE OFTEN THOUGHT SINCE I MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER BY TELLINGTHE OLD WOMAN THAT ID FOUND HER DAUGHTER AND HER GRANDCHILD IT WOULDHAVE SUITED MY FEELINGS BETTER IVE GOT A SOFT PLACE IN MY HEART
 BUTYOUVE BURIED THE OLD LADY BY THIS TIME I SUPPOSEITS ALL ONE TO HERNOW
 AND YOUVE GOT YOUR FORTUNE OUT OF THAT PROFITABLE BUSINESS WHICHHAD SUCH A BLESSING ON IT
 YOUVE TAKEN TO BEING A NOB BUYING LANDBEING A COUNTRY BASHAW
 STILL IN THE DISSENTING LINE EH
 STILL GODLY
OR TAKEN TO THE CHURCH AS MORE GENTEEL
THIS TIME MR
 RAFFLES SLOW WINK AND SLIGHT PROTRUSION OF HIS TONGUEWAS WORSE THAN A NIGHTMARE BECAUSE IT HELD THE CERTITUDE THAT IT WASNOT A NIGHTMARE BUT A WAKING MISERY
 MR
 BULSTRODE FELT A SHUDDERINGNAUSEA AND DID NOT SPEAK BUT WAS CONSIDERING DILIGENTLY WHETHER HESHOULD NOT LEAVE RAFFLES TO DO AS HE WOULD AND SIMPLY DEFY HIM AS ASLANDERER
 THE MAN WOULD SOON SHOW HIMSELF DISREPUTABLE ENOUGH TO MAKEPEOPLE DISBELIEVE HIM
 BUT NOT WHEN HE TELLS ANY UGLYLOOKING TRUTHABOUT YOU SAID DISCERNING CONSCIOUSNESS
 AND AGAIN IT SEEMED NOWRONG TO KEEP RAFFLES AT A DISTANCE BUT MR
 BULSTRODE SHRANK FROM THEDIRECT FALSEHOOD OF DENYING TRUE STATEMENTS
 IT WAS ONE THING TO LOOKBACK ON FORGIVEN SINS NAY TO EXPLAIN QUESTIONABLE CONFORMITY TO LAXCUSTOMS AND ANOTHER TO ENTER DELIBERATELY ON THE NECESSITY OFFALSEHOOD
BUT SINCE BULSTRODE DID NOT SPEAK RAFFLES RAN ON BY WAY OF USING TIMETO THE UTMOST
IVE NOT HAD SUCH FINE LUCK AS YOU BY JOVE
 THINGS WENT CONFOUNDEDLYWITH ME IN NEW YORK THOSE YANKEES ARE COOL HANDS AND A MAN OFGENTLEMANLY FEELINGS HAS NO CHANCE WITH THEM
 I MARRIED WHEN I CAMEBACKA NICE WOMAN IN THE TOBACCO TRADEVERY FOND OF MEBUT THE TRADEWAS RESTRICTED AS WE SAY
 SHE HAD BEEN SETTLED THERE A GOOD MANY YEARSBY A FRIEND BUT THERE WAS A SON TOO MUCH IN THE CASE
 JOSH AND I NEVERHIT IT OFF
 HOWEVER I MADE THE MOST OF THE POSITION AND IVE ALWAYSTAKEN MY GLASS IN GOOD COMPANY
 ITS BEEN ALL ON THE SQUARE WITH MEIM AS OPEN AS THE DAY
 YOU WONT TAKE IT ILL OF ME THAT I DIDNT LOOKYOU UP BEFORE
 IVE GOT A COMPLAINT THAT MAKES ME A LITTLE DILATORY
 ITHOUGHT YOU WERE TRADING AND PRAYING AWAY IN LONDON STILL AND DIDNTFIND YOU THERE
 BUT YOU SEE I WAS SENT TO YOU NICKPERHAPS FOR ABLESSING TO BOTH OF US
MR
 RAFFLES ENDED WITH A JOCOSE SNUFFLE NO MAN FELT HIS INTELLECT MORESUPERIOR TO RELIGIOUS CANT
 AND IF THE CUNNING WHICH CALCULATES ON THEMEANEST FEELINGS IN MEN COULD BE CALLED INTELLECT HE HAD HIS SHAREFOR UNDER THE BLURTING RALLYING TONE WITH WHICH HE SPOKE TO BULSTRODETHERE WAS AN EVIDENT SELECTION OF STATEMENTS AS IF THEY HAD BEEN SOMANY MOVES AT CHESS
 MEANWHILE BULSTRODE HAD DETERMINED ON HIS MOVEAND HE SAID WITH GATHERED RESOLUTIONYOU WILL DO WELL TO REFLECT MR
 RAFFLES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR AMAN TO OVERREACH HIMSELF IN THE EFFORT TO SECURE UNDUE ADVANTAGE
ALTHOUGH I AM NOT IN ANY WAY BOUND TO YOU I AM WILLING TO SUPPLY YOUWITH A REGULAR ANNUITYIN QUARTERLY PAYMENTSSO LONG AS YOU FULFIL APROMISE TO REMAIN AT A DISTANCE FROM THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
 IT IS IN YOURPOWER TO CHOOSE
 IF YOU INSIST ON REMAINING HERE EVEN FOR A SHORTTIME YOU WILL GET NOTHING FROM ME
 I SHALL DECLINE TO KNOW YOU
HA HA
 SAID RAFFLES WITH AN AFFECTED EXPLOSION THAT REMINDS ME OFA DROLL DOG OF A THIEF WHO DECLINED TO KNOW THE CONSTABLE
YOUR ALLUSIONS ARE LOST ON ME SIR SAID BULSTRODE WITH WHITE HEATTHE LAW HAS NO HOLD ON ME EITHER THROUGH YOUR AGENCY OR ANY OTHER
YOU CANT UNDERSTAND A JOKE MY GOOD FELLOW
 I ONLY MEANT THAT ISHOULD NEVER DECLINE TO KNOW YOU
 BUT LET US BE SERIOUS
 YOUR QUARTERLYPAYMENT WONT QUITE SUIT ME
 I LIKE MY FREEDOM
HERE RAFFLES ROSE AND STALKED ONCE OR TWICE UP AND DOWN THE ROOMSWINGING HIS LEG AND ASSUMING AN AIR OF MASTERLY MEDITATION
 AT LASTHE STOPPED OPPOSITE BULSTRODE AND SAID ILL TELL YOU WHAT
 GIVE US ACOUPLE OF HUNDREDSCOME THATS MODESTAND ILL GO AWAYHONORBRIGHT
PICK UP MY PORTMANTEAU AND GO AWAY
 BUT I SHALL NOT GIVE UP MYLIBERTY FOR A DIRTY ANNUITY
 I SHALL COME AND GO WHERE I LIKE
 PERHAPSIT MAY SUIT ME TO STAY AWAY AND CORRESPOND WITH A FRIEND PERHAPS NOT
HAVE YOU THE MONEY WITH YOU
NO I HAVE ONE HUNDRED SAID BULSTRODE FEELING THE IMMEDIATERIDDANCE TOO GREAT A RELIEF TO BE REJECTED ON THE GROUND OF FUTUREUNCERTAINTIES
 I WILL FORWARD YOU THE OTHER IF YOU WILL MENTION ANADDRESS
NO ILL WAIT HERE TILL YOU BRING IT SAID RAFFLES
 ILL TAKE ASTROLL AND HAVE A SNACK AND YOULL BE BACK BY THAT TIME
MR
 BULSTRODES SICKLY BODY SHATTERED BY THE AGITATIONS HE HAD GONETHROUGH SINCE THE LAST EVENING MADE HIM FEEL ABJECTLY IN THE POWER OFTHIS LOUD INVULNERABLE MAN
 AT THAT MOMENT HE SNATCHED AT A TEMPORARYREPOSE TO BE WON ON ANY TERMS
 HE WAS RISING TO DO WHAT RAFFLESSUGGESTED WHEN THE LATTER SAID LIFTING UP HIS FINGER AS IF WITH ASUDDEN RECOLLECTIONI DID HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AFTER SARAH AGAIN THOUGH I DIDNT TELL YOUID A TENDER CONSCIENCE ABOUT THAT PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN
 I DIDNT FINDHER BUT I FOUND OUT HER HUSBANDS NAME AND I MADE A NOTE OF IT
 BUTHANG IT I LOST MY POCKETBOOK
 HOWEVER IF I HEARD IT I SHOULD KNOW ITAGAIN
 IVE GOT MY FACULTIES AS IF I WAS IN MY PRIME BUT NAMES WEAROUT BY JOVE
 SOMETIMES IM NO BETTER THAN A CONFOUNDED TAXPAPERBEFORE THE NAMES ARE FILLED IN
 HOWEVER IF I HEAR OF HER AND HERFAMILY YOU SHALL KNOW NICK
 YOUD LIKE TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER NOWSHES YOUR STEPDAUGHTER
DOUBTLESS SAID MR
 BULSTRODE WITH THE USUAL STEADY LOOK OF HISLIGHTGRAY EYES THOUGH THAT MIGHT REDUCE MY POWER OF ASSISTING YOU
AS HE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM RAFFLES WINKED SLOWLY AT HIS BACK ANDTHEN TURNED TOWARDS THE WINDOW TO WATCH THE BANKER RIDINGAWAYVIRTUALLY AT HIS COMMAND
 HIS LIPS FIRST CURLED WITH A SMILE ANDTHEN OPENED WITH A SHORT TRIUMPHANT LAUGH
BUT WHAT THE DEUCE WAS THE NAME
 HE PRESENTLY SAID HALF ALOUDSCRATCHING HIS HEAD AND WRINKLING HIS BROWS HORIZONTALLY
 HE HAD NOTREALLY CARED OR THOUGHT ABOUT THIS POINT OF FORGETFULNESS UNTIL ITOCCURRED TO HIM IN HIS INVENTION OF ANNOYANCES FOR BULSTRODE
IT BEGAN WITH L IT WAS ALMOST ALL LS I FANCY HE WENT ON WITH ASENSE THAT HE WAS GETTING HOLD OF THE SLIPPERY NAME
 BUT THE HOLD WASTOO SLIGHT AND HE SOON GOT TIRED OF THIS MENTAL CHASE FOR FEW MENWERE MORE IMPATIENT OF PRIVATE OCCUPATION OR MORE IN NEED OF MAKINGTHEMSELVES CONTINUALLY HEARD THAN MR
 RAFFLES
 HE PREFERRED USING HISTIME IN PLEASANT CONVERSATION WITH THE BAILIFF AND THE HOUSEKEEPERFROM WHOM HE GATHERED AS MUCH AS HE WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT MR
BULSTRODES POSITION IN MIDDLEMARCH
AFTER ALL HOWEVER THERE WAS A DULL SPACE OF TIME WHICH NEEDEDRELIEVING WITH BREAD AND CHEESE AND ALE AND WHEN HE WAS SEATED ALONEWITH THESE RESOURCES IN THE WAINSCOTED PARLOR HE SUDDENLY SLAPPED HISKNEE AND EXCLAIMED LADISLAW
 THAT ACTION OF MEMORY WHICH HE HADTRIED TO SET GOING AND HAD ABANDONED IN DESPAIR HAD SUDDENLYCOMPLETED ITSELF WITHOUT CONSCIOUS EFFORTA COMMON EXPERIENCEAGREEABLE AS A COMPLETED SNEEZE EVEN IF THE NAME REMEMBERED IS OF NOVALUE
 RAFFLES IMMEDIATELY TOOK OUT HIS POCKETBOOK AND WROTE DOWN THENAME NOT BECAUSE HE EXPECTED TO USE IT BUT MERELY FOR THE SAKE OF NOTBEING AT A LOSS IF HE EVER DID HAPPEN TO WANT IT
 HE WAS NOT GOING TOTELL BULSTRODE THERE WAS NO ACTUAL GOOD IN TELLING AND TO A MIND LIKETHAT OF MR
 RAFFLES THERE IS ALWAYS PROBABLE GOOD IN A SECRET
HE WAS SATISFIED WITH HIS PRESENT SUCCESS AND BY THREE OCLOCK THATDAY HE HAD TAKEN UP HIS PORTMANTEAU AT THE TURNPIKE AND MOUNTED THECOACH RELIEVING MR
 BULSTRODES EYES OF AN UGLY BLACK SPOT ON THELANDSCAPE AT STONE COURT BUT NOT RELIEVING HIM OF THE DREAD THAT THEBLACK SPOT MIGHT REAPPEAR AND BECOME INSEPARABLE EVEN FROM THE VISIONOF HIS HEARTH

QUEL CHELLA PAR QUAND UN POCO SORRIDENON SI PUÒ DICER NÈ TENER A MENTESI È NUOVO MIRACOLO GENTILE
DANTE LA VITA NUOVA
BY THAT DELIGHTFUL MORNING WHEN THE HAYRICKS AT STONE COURT WERESCENTING THE AIR QUITE IMPARTIALLY AS IF MR
 RAFFLES HAD BEEN A GUESTWORTHY OF FINEST INCENSE DOROTHEA HAD AGAIN TAKEN UP HER ABODE ATLOWICK MANOR
 AFTER THREE MONTHS FRESHITT HAD BECOME RATHER OPPRESSIVETO SIT LIKE A MODEL FOR SAINT CATHERINE LOOKING RAPTUROUSLY AT CELIASBABY WOULD NOT DO FOR MANY HOURS IN THE DAY AND TO REMAIN IN THATMOMENTOUS BABES PRESENCE WITH PERSISTENT DISREGARD WAS A COURSE THATCOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TOLERATED IN A CHILDLESS SISTER
 DOROTHEA WOULDHAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF CARRYING BABY JOYFULLY FOR A MILE IF THERE HADBEEN NEED AND OF LOVING IT THE MORE TENDERLY FOR THAT LABOR BUT TO ANAUNT WHO DOES NOT RECOGNIZE HER INFANT NEPHEW AS BOUDDHA AND HASNOTHING TO DO FOR HIM BUT TO ADMIRE HIS BEHAVIOR IS APT TO APPEARMONOTONOUS AND THE INTEREST OF WATCHING HIM EXHAUSTIBLE
 THISPOSSIBILITY WAS QUITE HIDDEN FROM CELIA WHO FELT THAT DOROTHEASCHILDLESS WIDOWHOOD FELL IN QUITE PRETTILY WITH THE BIRTH OF LITTLEARTHUR BABY WAS NAMED AFTER MR
 BROOKE
DODO IS JUST THE CREATURE NOT TO MIND ABOUT HAVING ANYTHING OF HEROWNCHILDREN OR ANYTHING
 SAID CELIA TO HER HUSBAND
 AND IF SHE HADHAD A BABY IT NEVER COULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A DEAR AS ARTHUR
 COULD ITJAMES
NOT IF IT HAD BEEN LIKE CASAUBON SAID SIR JAMES CONSCIOUS OF SOMEINDIRECTNESS IN HIS ANSWER AND OF HOLDING A STRICTLY PRIVATE OPINIONAS TO THE PERFECTIONS OF HIS FIRSTBORN
NO
 JUST IMAGINE
 REALLY IT WAS A MERCY SAID CELIA AND I THINK ITIS VERY NICE FOR DODO TO BE A WIDOW
 SHE CAN BE JUST AS FOND OF OURBABY AS IF IT WERE HER OWN AND SHE CAN HAVE AS MANY NOTIONS OF HER OWNAS SHE LIKES
IT IS A PITY SHE WAS NOT A QUEEN SAID THE DEVOUT SIR JAMES
BUT WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE BEEN THEN
 WE MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING ELSESAID CELIA OBJECTING TO SO LABORIOUS A FLIGHT OF IMAGINATION
 I LIKEHER BETTER AS SHE IS
HENCE WHEN SHE FOUND THAT DOROTHEA WAS MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR HERFINAL DEPARTURE TO LOWICK CELIA RAISED HER EYEBROWS WITHDISAPPOINTMENT AND IN HER QUIET UNEMPHATIC WAY SHOT A NEEDLEARROW OFSARCASM
WHAT WILL YOU DO AT LOWICK DODO
 YOU SAY YOURSELF THERE IS NOTHING TOBE DONE THERE EVERYBODY IS SO CLEAN AND WELL OFF IT MAKES YOU QUITEMELANCHOLY
 AND HERE YOU HAVE BEEN SO HAPPY GOING ALL ABOUT TIPTON WITHMR
 GARTH INTO THE WORST BACKYARDS
 AND NOW UNCLE IS ABROAD YOU ANDMR
 GARTH CAN HAVE IT ALL YOUR OWN WAY AND I AM SURE JAMES DOESEVERYTHING YOU TELL HIM
I SHALL OFTEN COME HERE AND I SHALL SEE HOW BABY GROWS ALL THEBETTER SAID DOROTHEA
BUT YOU WILL NEVER SEE HIM WASHED SAID CELIA AND THAT IS QUITE THEBEST PART OF THE DAY
 SHE WAS ALMOST POUTING IT DID SEEM TO HER VERYHARD IN DODO TO GO AWAY FROM THE BABY WHEN SHE MIGHT STAY
DEAR KITTY I WILL COME AND STAY ALL NIGHT ON PURPOSE SAID DOROTHEABUT I WANT TO BE ALONE NOW AND IN MY OWN HOME
 I WISH TO KNOW THEFAREBROTHERS BETTER AND TO TALK TO MR
 FAREBROTHER ABOUT WHAT THERE ISTO BE DONE IN MIDDLEMARCH
DOROTHEAS NATIVE STRENGTH OF WILL WAS NO LONGER ALL CONVERTED INTORESOLUTE SUBMISSION
 SHE HAD A GREAT YEARNING TO BE AT LOWICK AND WASSIMPLY DETERMINED TO GO NOT FEELING BOUND TO TELL ALL HER REASONS
 BUTEVERY ONE AROUND HER DISAPPROVED
 SIR JAMES WAS MUCH PAINED ANDOFFERED THAT THEY SHOULD ALL MIGRATE TO CHELTENHAM FOR A FEW MONTHSWITH THE SACRED ARK OTHERWISE CALLED A CRADLE AT THAT PERIOD A MANCOULD HARDLY KNOW WHAT TO PROPOSE IF CHELTENHAM WERE REJECTED
THE DOWAGER LADY CHETTAM JUST RETURNED FROM A VISIT TO HER DAUGHTER INTOWN WISHED AT LEAST THAT MRS
 VIGO SHOULD BE WRITTEN TO ANDINVITED TO ACCEPT THE OFFICE OF COMPANION TO MRS
 CASAUBON IT WAS NOTCREDIBLE THAT DOROTHEA AS A YOUNG WIDOW WOULD THINK OF LIVING ALONE INTHE HOUSE AT LOWICK
 MRS
 VIGO HAD BEEN READER AND SECRETARY TO ROYALPERSONAGES AND IN POINT OF KNOWLEDGE AND SENTIMENTS EVEN DOROTHEACOULD HAVE NOTHING TO OBJECT TO HER
MRS
 CADWALLADER SAID PRIVATELY YOU WILL CERTAINLY GO MAD IN THATHOUSE ALONE MY DEAR
 YOU WILL SEE VISIONS
 WE HAVE ALL GOT TO EXERTOURSELVES A LITTLE TO KEEP SANE AND CALL THINGS BY THE SAME NAMES ASOTHER PEOPLE CALL THEM BY
 TO BE SURE FOR YOUNGER SONS AND WOMEN WHOHAVE NO MONEY IT IS A SORT OF PROVISION TO GO MAD THEY ARE TAKEN CAREOF THEN
 BUT YOU MUST NOT RUN INTO THAT
 I DARE SAY YOU ARE A LITTLEBORED HERE WITH OUR GOOD DOWAGER BUT THINK WHAT A BORE YOU MIGHTBECOME YOURSELF TO YOUR FELLOWCREATURES IF YOU WERE ALWAYS PLAYINGTRAGEDY QUEEN AND TAKING THINGS SUBLIMELY
 SITTING ALONE IN THATLIBRARY AT LOWICK YOU MAY FANCY YOURSELF RULING THE WEATHER YOU MUSTGET A FEW PEOPLE ROUND YOU WHO WOULDNT BELIEVE YOU IF YOU TOLD THEM
THAT IS A GOOD LOWERING MEDICINE
I NEVER CALLED EVERYTHING BY THE SAME NAME THAT ALL THE PEOPLE ABOUTME DID SAID DOROTHEA STOUTLY
BUT I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE FOUND OUT YOUR MISTAKE MY DEAR SAID MRS
CADWALLADER AND THAT IS A PROOF OF SANITY
DOROTHEA WAS AWARE OF THE STING BUT IT DID NOT HURT HER
 NO SHESAID I STILL THINK THAT THE GREATER PART OF THE WORLD IS MISTAKENABOUT MANY THINGS
 SURELY ONE MAY BE SANE AND YET THINK SO SINCE THEGREATER PART OF THE WORLD HAS OFTEN HAD TO COME ROUND FROM ITSOPINION
MRS
 CADWALLADER SAID NO MORE ON THAT POINT TO DOROTHEA BUT TO HERHUSBAND SHE REMARKED IT WILL BE WELL FOR HER TO MARRY AGAIN AS SOONAS IT IS PROPER IF ONE COULD GET HER AMONG THE RIGHT PEOPLE
 OF COURSETHE CHETTAMS WOULD NOT WISH IT
 BUT I SEE CLEARLY A HUSBAND IS THE BESTTHING TO KEEP HER IN ORDER
 IF WE WERE NOT SO POOR I WOULD INVITE LORDTRITON
 HE WILL BE MARQUIS SOME DAY AND THERE IS NO DENYING THAT SHEWOULD MAKE A GOOD MARCHIONESS SHE LOOKS HANDSOMER THAN EVER IN HERMOURNING
MY DEAR ELINOR DO LET THE POOR WOMAN ALONE
 SUCH CONTRIVANCES ARE OFNO USE SAID THE EASY RECTOR
NO USE
 HOW ARE MATCHES MADE EXCEPT BY BRINGING MEN AND WOMENTOGETHER
 AND IT IS A SHAME THAT HER UNCLE SHOULD HAVE RUN AWAY ANDSHUT UP THE GRANGE JUST NOW
 THERE OUGHT TO BE PLENTY OF ELIGIBLEMATCHES INVITED TO FRESHITT AND THE GRANGE
 LORD TRITON IS PRECISELYTHE MAN FULL OF PLANS FOR MAKING THE PEOPLE HAPPY IN A SOFTHEADEDSORT OF WAY
 THAT WOULD JUST SUIT MRS
 CASAUBON
LET MRS
 CASAUBON CHOOSE FOR HERSELF ELINOR
THAT IS THE NONSENSE YOU WISE MEN TALK
 HOW CAN SHE CHOOSE IF SHE HASNO VARIETY TO CHOOSE FROM
 A WOMANS CHOICE USUALLY MEANS TAKING THEONLY MAN SHE CAN GET
 MARK MY WORDS HUMPHREY
 IF HER FRIENDS DONTEXERT THEMSELVES THERE WILL BE A WORSE BUSINESS THAN THE CASAUBONBUSINESS YET
FOR HEAVENS SAKE DONT TOUCH ON THAT TOPIC ELINOR
 IT IS A VERY SOREPOINT WITH SIR JAMES
 HE WOULD BE DEEPLY OFFENDED IF YOU ENTERED ON ITTO HIM UNNECESSARILY
I HAVE NEVER ENTERED ON IT SAID MRS CADWALLADER OPENING HER HANDS
CELIA TOLD ME ALL ABOUT THE WILL AT THE BEGINNING WITHOUT ANY ASKINGOF MINE
YES YES BUT THEY WANT THE THING HUSHED UP AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THEYOUNG FELLOW IS GOING OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
MRS
 CADWALLADER SAID NOTHING BUT GAVE HER HUSBAND THREE SIGNIFICANTNODS WITH A VERY SARCASTIC EXPRESSION IN HER DARK EYES
DOROTHEA QUIETLY PERSISTED IN SPITE OF REMONSTRANCE AND PERSUASION
 SOBY THE END OF JUNE THE SHUTTERS WERE ALL OPENED AT LOWICK MANOR ANDTHE MORNING GAZED CALMLY INTO THE LIBRARY SHINING ON THE ROWS OFNOTEBOOKS AS IT SHINES ON THE WEARY WASTE PLANTED WITH HUGE STONESTHE MUTE MEMORIAL OF A FORGOTTEN FAITH AND THE EVENING LADEN WITHROSES ENTERED SILENTLY INTO THE BLUEGREEN BOUDOIR WHERE DOROTHEA CHOSEOFTENEST TO SIT
 AT FIRST SHE WALKED INTO EVERY ROOM QUESTIONING THEEIGHTEEN MONTHS OF HER MARRIED LIFE AND CARRYING ON HER THOUGHTS AS IFTHEY WERE A SPEECH TO BE HEARD BY HER HUSBAND
 THEN SHE LINGERED INTHE LIBRARY AND COULD NOT BE AT REST TILL SHE HAD CAREFULLY RANGED ALLTHE NOTEBOOKS AS SHE IMAGINED THAT HE WOULD WISH TO SEE THEM INORDERLY SEQUENCE
 THE PITY WHICH HAD BEEN THE RESTRAINING COMPELLINGMOTIVE IN HER LIFE WITH HIM STILL CLUNG ABOUT HIS IMAGE EVEN WHILE SHEREMONSTRATED WITH HIM IN INDIGNANT THOUGHT AND TOLD HIM THAT HE WASUNJUST
 ONE LITTLE ACT OF HERS MAY PERHAPS BE SMILED AT ASSUPERSTITIOUS
 THE SYNOPTICAL TABULATION FOR THE USE OF MRS
 CASAUBONSHE CAREFULLY ENCLOSED AND SEALED WRITING WITHIN THE ENVELOPE ICOULD NOT USE IT
 DO YOU NOT SEE NOW THAT I COULD NOT SUBMIT MY SOUL TOYOURS BY WORKING HOPELESSLY AT WHAT I HAVE NO BELIEF INDOROTHEA
THEN SHE DEPOSITED THE PAPER IN HER OWN DESK
THAT SILENT COLLOQUY WAS PERHAPS ONLY THE MORE EARNEST BECAUSEUNDERNEATH AND THROUGH IT ALL THERE WAS ALWAYS THE DEEP LONGING WHICHHAD REALLY DETERMINED HER TO COME TO LOWICK
 THE LONGING WAS TO SEEWILL LADISLAW
 SHE DID NOT KNOW ANY GOOD THAT COULD COME OF THEIRMEETING SHE WAS HELPLESS HER HANDS HAD BEEN TIED FROM MAKING UP TOHIM FOR ANY UNFAIRNESS IN HIS LOT
 BUT HER SOUL THIRSTED TO SEE HIM
HOW COULD IT BE OTHERWISE
 IF A PRINCESS IN THE DAYS OF ENCHANTMENT HADSEEN A FOURFOOTED CREATURE FROM AMONG THOSE WHICH LIVE IN HERDS COMETO HER ONCE AND AGAIN WITH A HUMAN GAZE WHICH RESTED UPON HER WITHCHOICE AND BESEECHING WHAT WOULD SHE THINK OF IN HER JOURNEYING WHATWOULD SHE LOOK FOR WHEN THE HERDS PASSED HER
 SURELY FOR THE GAZE WHICHHAD FOUND HER AND WHICH SHE WOULD KNOW AGAIN
 LIFE WOULD BE NO BETTERTHAN CANDLELIGHT TINSEL AND DAYLIGHT RUBBISH IF OUR SPIRITS WERE NOTTOUCHED BY WHAT HAS BEEN TO ISSUES OF LONGING AND CONSTANCY
 IT WASTRUE THAT DOROTHEA WANTED TO KNOW THE FAREBROTHERS BETTER ANDESPECIALLY TO TALK TO THE NEW RECTOR BUT ALSO TRUE THAT REMEMBERINGWHAT LYDGATE HAD TOLD HER ABOUT WILL LADISLAW AND LITTLE MISS NOBLESHE COUNTED ON WILLS COMING TO LOWICK TO SEE THE FAREBROTHER FAMILY
THE VERY FIRST SUNDAY BEFORE SHE ENTERED THE CHURCH SHE SAW HIM ASSHE HAD SEEN HIM THE LAST TIME SHE WAS THERE ALONE IN THE CLERGYMANSPEW BUT WHEN SHE ENTERED HIS FIGURE WAS GONE
IN THE WEEKDAYS WHEN SHE WENT TO SEE THE LADIES AT THE RECTORY SHELISTENED IN VAIN FOR SOME WORD THAT THEY MIGHT LET FALL ABOUT WILL BUTIT SEEMED TO HER THAT MRS
 FAREBROTHER TALKED OF EVERY ONE ELSE IN THENEIGHBORHOOD AND OUT OF IT
PROBABLY SOME OF MR
 FAREBROTHERS MIDDLEMARCH HEARERS MAY FOLLOW HIMTO LOWICK SOMETIMES
 DO YOU NOT THINK SO
 SAID DOROTHEA RATHERDESPISING HERSELF FOR HAVING A SECRET MOTIVE IN ASKING THE QUESTION
IF THEY ARE WISE THEY WILL MRS
 CASAUBON SAID THE OLD LADY
 I SEETHAT YOU SET A RIGHT VALUE ON MY SONS PREACHING
 HIS GRANDFATHER ON MYSIDE WAS AN EXCELLENT CLERGYMAN BUT HIS FATHER WAS IN THE LAWMOSTEXEMPLARY AND HONEST NEVERTHELESS WHICH IS A REASON FOR OUR NEVERBEING RICH
 THEY SAY FORTUNE IS A WOMAN AND CAPRICIOUS
 BUT SOMETIMESSHE IS A GOOD WOMAN AND GIVES TO THOSE WHO MERIT WHICH HAS BEEN THECASE WITH YOU MRS
 CASAUBON WHO HAVE GIVEN A LIVING TO MY SON
MRS
 FAREBROTHER RECURRED TO HER KNITTING WITH A DIGNIFIED SATISFACTIONIN HER NEAT LITTLE EFFORT AT ORATORY BUT THIS WAS NOT WHAT DOROTHEAWANTED TO HEAR
 POOR THING
 SHE DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHETHER WILL LADISLAWWAS STILL AT MIDDLEMARCH AND THERE WAS NO ONE WHOM SHE DARED TO ASKUNLESS IT WERE LYDGATE
 BUT JUST NOW SHE COULD NOT SEE LYDGATE WITHOUTSENDING FOR HIM OR GOING TO SEEK HIM
 PERHAPS WILL LADISLAW HAVINGHEARD OF THAT STRANGE BAN AGAINST HIM LEFT BY MR
 CASAUBON HAD FELT ITBETTER THAT HE AND SHE SHOULD NOT MEET AGAIN AND PERHAPS SHE WAS WRONGTO WISH FOR A MEETING THAT OTHERS MIGHT FIND MANY GOOD REASONS AGAINST
STILL I DO WISH IT CAME AT THE END OF THOSE WISE REFLECTIONS ASNATURALLY AS A SOB AFTER HOLDING THE BREATH
 AND THE MEETING DIDHAPPEN BUT IN A FORMAL WAY QUITE UNEXPECTED BY HER
ONE MORNING ABOUT ELEVEN DOROTHEA WAS SEATED IN HER BOUDOIR WITH AMAP OF THE LAND ATTACHED TO THE MANOR AND OTHER PAPERS BEFORE HERWHICH WERE TO HELP HER IN MAKING AN EXACT STATEMENT FOR HERSELF OF HERINCOME AND AFFAIRS
 SHE HAD NOT YET APPLIED HERSELF TO HER WORK BUTWAS SEATED WITH HER HANDS FOLDED ON HER LAP LOOKING OUT ALONG THEAVENUE OF LIMES TO THE DISTANT FIELDS
 EVERY LEAF WAS AT REST IN THESUNSHINE THE FAMILIAR SCENE WAS CHANGELESS AND SEEMED TO REPRESENTTHE PROSPECT OF HER LIFE FULL OF MOTIVELESS EASEMOTIVELESS IF HEROWN ENERGY COULD NOT SEEK OUT REASONS FOR ARDENT ACTION
 THE WIDOWSCAP OF THOSE TIMES MADE AN OVAL FRAME FOR THE FACE AND HAD A CROWNSTANDING UP THE DRESS WAS AN EXPERIMENT IN THE UTMOST LAYING ON OFCRAPE BUT THIS HEAVY SOLEMNITY OF CLOTHING MADE HER FACE LOOK ALL THEYOUNGER WITH ITS RECOVERED BLOOM AND THE SWEET INQUIRING CANDOR OFHER EYES
HER REVERIE WAS BROKEN BY TANTRIPP WHO CAME TO SAY THAT MR
 LADISLAWWAS BELOW AND BEGGED PERMISSION TO SEE MADAM IF IT WERE NOT TOO EARLY
I WILL SEE HIM SAID DOROTHEA RISING IMMEDIATELY
 LET HIM BE SHOWNINTO THE DRAWINGROOM
THE DRAWINGROOM WAS THE MOST NEUTRAL ROOM IN THE HOUSE TO HERTHE ONELEAST ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRIALS OF HER MARRIED LIFE THE DAMASKMATCHED THE WOODWORK WHICH WAS ALL WHITE AND GOLD THERE WERE TWOTALL MIRRORS AND TABLES WITH NOTHING ON THEMIN BRIEF IT WAS A ROOMWHERE YOU HAD NO REASON FOR SITTING IN ONE PLACE RATHER THAN INANOTHER
 IT WAS BELOW THE BOUDOIR AND HAD ALSO A BOWWINDOW LOOKINGOUT ON THE AVENUE
 BUT WHEN PRATT SHOWED WILL LADISLAW INTO IT THEWINDOW WAS OPEN AND A WINGED VISITOR BUZZING IN AND OUT NOW AND THENWITHOUT MINDING THE FURNITURE MADE THE ROOM LOOK LESS FORMAL ANDUNINHABITED
GLAD TO SEE YOU HERE AGAIN SIR SAID PRATT LINGERING TO ADJUST ABLIND
I AM ONLY COME TO SAY GOODBY PRATT SAID WILL WHO WISHED EVEN THEBUTLER TO KNOW THAT HE WAS TOO PROUD TO HANG ABOUT MRS
 CASAUBON NOWSHE WAS A RICH WIDOW
VERY SORRY TO HEAR IT SIR SAID PRATT RETIRING
 OF COURSE AS ASERVANT WHO WAS TO BE TOLD NOTHING HE KNEW THE FACT OF WHICH LADISLAWWAS STILL IGNORANT AND HAD DRAWN HIS INFERENCES INDEED HAD NOTDIFFERED FROM HIS BETROTHED TANTRIPP WHEN SHE SAID YOUR MASTER WAS ASJEALOUS AS A FIENDAND NO REASON
 MADAM WOULD LOOK HIGHER THAN MR
LADISLAW ELSE I DONT KNOW HER
 MRS
 CADWALLADERS MAID SAYS THERES ALORD COMING WHO IS TO MARRY HER WHEN THE MOURNINGS OVER
THERE WERE NOT MANY MOMENTS FOR WILL TO WALK ABOUT WITH HIS HAT IN HISHAND BEFORE DOROTHEA ENTERED
 THE MEETING WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THATFIRST MEETING IN ROME WHEN WILL HAD BEEN EMBARRASSED AND DOROTHEA CALM
THIS TIME HE FELT MISERABLE BUT DETERMINED WHILE SHE WAS IN A STATE OFAGITATION WHICH COULD NOT BE HIDDEN
 JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR SHE HAD FELTTHAT THIS LONGEDFOR MEETING WAS AFTER ALL TOO DIFFICULT AND WHEN SHESAW WILL ADVANCING TOWARDS HER THE DEEP BLUSH WHICH WAS RARE IN HERCAME WITH PAINFUL SUDDENNESS
 NEITHER OF THEM KNEW HOW IT WAS BUTNEITHER OF THEM SPOKE
 SHE GAVE HER HAND FOR A MOMENT AND THEN THEYWENT TO SIT DOWN NEAR THE WINDOW SHE ON ONE SETTEE AND HE ON ANOTHEROPPOSITE
 WILL WAS PECULIARLY UNEASY IT SEEMED TO HIM NOT LIKEDOROTHEA THAT THE MERE FACT OF HER BEING A WIDOW SHOULD CAUSE SUCH ACHANGE IN HER MANNER OF RECEIVING HIM AND HE KNEW OF NO OTHERCONDITION WHICH COULD HAVE AFFECTED THEIR PREVIOUS RELATION TO EACHOTHEREXCEPT THAT AS HIS IMAGINATION AT ONCE TOLD HIM HER FRIENDSMIGHT HAVE BEEN POISONING HER MIND WITH THEIR SUSPICIONS OF HIM
I HOPE I HAVE NOT PRESUMED TOO MUCH IN CALLING SAID WILL I COULDNOT BEAR TO LEAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND BEGIN A NEW LIFE WITHOUT SEEINGYOU TO SAY GOODBY
PRESUMED
 SURELY NOT
 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT UNKIND IF YOU HAD NOTWISHED TO SEE ME SAID DOROTHEA HER HABIT OF SPEAKING WITH PERFECTGENUINENESS ASSERTING ITSELF THROUGH ALL HER UNCERTAINTY AND AGITATION
ARE YOU GOING AWAY IMMEDIATELY
VERY SOON I THINK
 I INTEND TO GO TO TOWN AND EAT MY DINNERS AS ABARRISTER SINCE THEY SAY THAT IS THE PREPARATION FOR ALL PUBLICBUSINESS
 THERE WILL BE A GREAT DEAL OF POLITICAL WORK TO BE DONEBYANDBY AND I MEAN TO TRY AND DO SOME OF IT
 OTHER MEN HAVE MANAGEDTO WIN AN HONORABLE POSITION FOR THEMSELVES WITHOUT FAMILY OR MONEY
AND THAT WILL MAKE IT ALL THE MORE HONORABLE SAID DOROTHEAARDENTLY
 BESIDES YOU HAVE SO MANY TALENTS
 I HAVE HEARD FROM MYUNCLE HOW WELL YOU SPEAK IN PUBLIC SO THAT EVERY ONE IS SORRY WHEN YOULEAVE OFF AND HOW CLEARLY YOU CAN EXPLAIN THINGS
 AND YOU CARE THATJUSTICE SHOULD BE DONE TO EVERY ONE
 I AM SO GLAD
 WHEN WE WERE INROME I THOUGHT YOU ONLY CARED FOR POETRY AND ART AND THE THINGS THATADORN LIFE FOR US WHO ARE WELL OFF
 BUT NOW I KNOW YOU THINK ABOUT THEREST OF THE WORLD
WHILE SHE WAS SPEAKING DOROTHEA HAD LOST HER PERSONAL EMBARRASSMENTAND HAD BECOME LIKE HER FORMER SELF
 SHE LOOKED AT WILL WITH A DIRECTGLANCE FULL OF DELIGHTED CONFIDENCE
YOU APPROVE OF MY GOING AWAY FOR YEARS THEN AND NEVER COMING HEREAGAIN TILL I HAVE MADE MYSELF OF SOME MARK IN THE WORLD
 SAID WILLTRYING HARD TO RECONCILE THE UTMOST PRIDE WITH THE UTMOST EFFORT TO GETAN EXPRESSION OF STRONG FEELING FROM DOROTHEA
SHE WAS NOT AWARE HOW LONG IT WAS BEFORE SHE ANSWERED
 SHE HAD TURNEDHER HEAD AND WAS LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW ON THE ROSEBUSHES WHICHSEEMED TO HAVE IN THEM THE SUMMERS OF ALL THE YEARS WHEN WILL WOULD BEAWAY
 THIS WAS NOT JUDICIOUS BEHAVIOR
 BUT DOROTHEA NEVER THOUGHT OFSTUDYING HER MANNERS SHE THOUGHT ONLY OF BOWING TO A SAD NECESSITYWHICH DIVIDED HER FROM WILL
 THOSE FIRST WORDS OF HIS ABOUT HISINTENTIONS HAD SEEMED TO MAKE EVERYTHING CLEAR TO HER HE KNEW SHESUPPOSED ALL ABOUT MR
 CASAUBONS FINAL CONDUCT IN RELATION TO HIMAND IT HAD COME TO HIM WITH THE SAME SORT OF SHOCK AS TO HERSELF
 HEHAD NEVER FELT MORE THAN FRIENDSHIP FOR HERHAD NEVER HAD ANYTHING INHIS MIND TO JUSTIFY WHAT SHE FELT TO BE HER HUSBANDS OUTRAGE ON THEFEELINGS OF BOTH AND THAT FRIENDSHIP HE STILL FELT
 SOMETHING WHICHMAY BE CALLED AN INWARD SILENT SOB HAD GONE ON IN DOROTHEA BEFORE SHESAID WITH A PURE VOICE JUST TREMBLING IN THE LAST WORDS AS IF ONLYFROM ITS LIQUID FLEXIBILITYYES IT MUST BE RIGHT FOR YOU TO DO AS YOU SAY
 I SHALL BE VERY HAPPYWHEN I HEAR THAT YOU HAVE MADE YOUR VALUE FELT
 BUT YOU MUST HAVEPATIENCE
 IT WILL PERHAPS BE A LONG WHILE
WILL NEVER QUITE KNEW HOW IT WAS THAT HE SAVED HIMSELF FROM FALLINGDOWN AT HER FEET WHEN THE LONG WHILE CAME FORTH WITH ITS GENTLETREMOR
 HE USED TO SAY THAT THE HORRIBLE HUE AND SURFACE OF HER CRAPEDRESS WAS MOST LIKELY THE SUFFICIENT CONTROLLING FORCE
 HE SAT STILLHOWEVER AND ONLY SAIDI SHALL NEVER HEAR FROM YOU
 AND YOU WILL FORGET ALL ABOUT ME
NO SAID DOROTHEA I SHALL NEVER FORGET YOU
 I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTENANY ONE WHOM I ONCE KNEW
 MY LIFE HAS NEVER BEEN CROWDED AND SEEMS NOTLIKELY TO BE SO
 AND I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF SPACE FOR MEMORY AT LOWICKHAVENT I
 SHE SMILED
GOOD GOD
 WILL BURST OUT PASSIONATELY RISING WITH HIS HAT STILL INHIS HAND AND WALKING AWAY TO A MARBLE TABLE WHERE HE SUDDENLY TURNEDAND LEANED HIS BACK AGAINST IT
 THE BLOOD HAD MOUNTED TO HIS FACE ANDNECK AND HE LOOKED ALMOST ANGRY
 IT HAD SEEMED TO HIM AS IF THEY WERELIKE TWO CREATURES SLOWLY TURNING TO MARBLE IN EACH OTHERS PRESENCEWHILE THEIR HEARTS WERE CONSCIOUS AND THEIR EYES WERE YEARNING
 BUTTHERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT
 IT SHOULD NEVER BE TRUE OF HIM THAT IN THISMEETING TO WHICH HE HAD COME WITH BITTER RESOLUTION HE HAD ENDED BY ACONFESSION WHICH MIGHT BE INTERPRETED INTO ASKING FOR HER FORTUNE
MOREOVER IT WAS ACTUALLY TRUE THAT HE WAS FEARFUL OF THE EFFECT WHICHSUCH CONFESSIONS MIGHT HAVE ON DOROTHEA HERSELF
SHE LOOKED AT HIM FROM THAT DISTANCE IN SOME TROUBLE IMAGINING THATTHERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN OFFENCE IN HER WORDS
 BUT ALL THE WHILE THEREWAS A CURRENT OF THOUGHT IN HER ABOUT HIS PROBABLE WANT OF MONEY ANDTHE IMPOSSIBILITY OF HER HELPING HIM
 IF HER UNCLE HAD BEEN AT HOMESOMETHING MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE THROUGH HIM
 IT WAS THIS PREOCCUPATIONWITH THE HARDSHIP OF WILLS WANTING MONEY WHILE SHE HAD WHAT OUGHT TOHAVE BEEN HIS SHARE WHICH LED HER TO SAY SEEING THAT HE REMAINEDSILENT AND LOOKED AWAY FROM HERI WONDER WHETHER YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT MINIATURE WHICH HANGSUPSTAIRSI MEAN THAT BEAUTIFUL MINIATURE OF YOUR GRANDMOTHER
 I THINKIT IS NOT RIGHT FOR ME TO KEEP IT IF YOU WOULD WISH TO HAVE IT
 IT ISWONDERFULLY LIKE YOU
YOU ARE VERY GOOD SAID WILL IRRITABLY
 NO I DONT MIND ABOUT IT
IT IS NOT VERY CONSOLING TO HAVE ONES OWN LIKENESS
 IT WOULD BE MORECONSOLING IF OTHERS WANTED TO HAVE IT
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CHERISH HER MEMORYI THOUGHT DOROTHEABROKE OFF AN INSTANT HER IMAGINATION SUDDENLY WARNING HER AWAY FROMAUNT JULIAS HISTORYYOU WOULD SURELY LIKE TO HAVE THE MINIATURE AS AFAMILY MEMORIAL
WHY SHOULD I HAVE THAT WHEN I HAVE NOTHING ELSE
 A MAN WITH ONLY APORTMANTEAU FOR HIS STOWAGE MUST KEEP HIS MEMORIALS IN HIS HEAD
WILL SPOKE AT RANDOM HE WAS MERELY VENTING HIS PETULANCE IT WAS ALITTLE TOO EXASPERATING TO HAVE HIS GRANDMOTHERS PORTRAIT OFFERED HIMAT THAT MOMENT
 BUT TO DOROTHEAS FEELING HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIARSTING
 SHE ROSE AND SAID WITH A TOUCH OF INDIGNATION AS WELL ASHAUTEURYOU ARE MUCH THE HAPPIER OF US TWO MR
 LADISLAW TO HAVE NOTHING
WILL WAS STARTLED
 WHATEVER THE WORDS MIGHT BE THE TONE SEEMED LIKE ADISMISSAL AND QUITTING HIS LEANING POSTURE HE WALKED A LITTLE WAYTOWARDS HER
 THEIR EYES MET BUT WITH A STRANGE QUESTIONING GRAVITY
SOMETHING WAS KEEPING THEIR MINDS ALOOF AND EACH WAS LEFT TOCONJECTURE WHAT WAS IN THE OTHER
 WILL HAD REALLY NEVER THOUGHT OFHIMSELF AS HAVING A CLAIM OF INHERITANCE ON THE PROPERTY WHICH WAS HELDBY DOROTHEA AND WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A NARRATIVE TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTANDHER PRESENT FEELING
I NEVER FELT IT A MISFORTUNE TO HAVE NOTHING TILL NOW HE SAID
 BUTPOVERTY MAY BE AS BAD AS LEPROSY IF IT DIVIDES US FROM WHAT WE MOSTCARE FOR
THE WORDS CUT DOROTHEA TO THE HEART AND MADE HER RELENT
 SHE ANSWEREDIN A TONE OF SAD FELLOWSHIP
SORROW COMES IN SO MANY WAYS
 TWO YEARS AGO I HAD NO NOTION OF THATIMEAN OF THE UNEXPECTED WAY IN WHICH TROUBLE COMES AND TIES OUR HANDSAND MAKES US SILENT WHEN WE LONG TO SPEAK
 I USED TO DESPISE WOMEN ALITTLE FOR NOT SHAPING THEIR LIVES MORE AND DOING BETTER THINGS
 I WASVERY FOND OF DOING AS I LIKED BUT I HAVE ALMOST GIVEN IT UP SHEENDED SMILING PLAYFULLY
I HAVE NOT GIVEN UP DOING AS I LIKE BUT I CAN VERY SELDOM DO ITSAID WILL
 HE WAS STANDING TWO YARDS FROM HER WITH HIS MIND FULL OFCONTRADICTORY DESIRES AND RESOLVESDESIRING SOME UNMISTAKABLE PROOFTHAT SHE LOVED HIM AND YET DREADING THE POSITION INTO WHICH SUCH APROOF MIGHT BRING HIM
 THE THING ONE MOST LONGS FOR MAY BE SURROUNDEDWITH CONDITIONS THAT WOULD BE INTOLERABLE
AT THIS MOMENT PRATT ENTERED AND SAID SIR JAMES CHETTAM IS IN THELIBRARY MADAM
ASK SIR JAMES TO COME IN HERE SAID DOROTHEA IMMEDIATELY
 IT WAS ASIF THE SAME ELECTRIC SHOCK HAD PASSED THROUGH HER AND WILL
 EACH OFTHEM FELT PROUDLY RESISTANT AND NEITHER LOOKED AT THE OTHER WHILETHEY AWAITED SIR JAMESS ENTRANCE
AFTER SHAKING HANDS WITH DOROTHEA HE BOWED AS SLIGHTLY AS POSSIBLE TOLADISLAW WHO REPAID THE SLIGHTNESS EXACTLY AND THEN GOING TOWARDSDOROTHEA SAIDI MUST SAY GOODBY MRS
 CASAUBON AND PROBABLY FOR A LONG WHILE
DOROTHEA PUT OUT HER HAND AND SAID HER GOODBY CORDIALLY
 THE SENSETHAT SIR JAMES WAS DEPRECIATING WILL AND BEHAVING RUDELY TO HIMROUSED HER RESOLUTION AND DIGNITY THERE WAS NO TOUCH OF CONFUSION INHER MANNER
 AND WHEN WILL HAD LEFT THE ROOM SHE LOOKED WITH SUCH CALMSELFPOSSESSION AT SIR JAMES SAYING HOW IS CELIA
 THAT HE WASOBLIGED TO BEHAVE AS IF NOTHING HAD ANNOYED HIM
 AND WHAT WOULD BE THEUSE OF BEHAVING OTHERWISE
 INDEED SIR JAMES SHRANK WITH SO MUCHDISLIKE FROM THE ASSOCIATION EVEN IN THOUGHT OF DOROTHEA WITH LADISLAWAS HER POSSIBLE LOVER THAT HE WOULD HIMSELF HAVE WISHED TO AVOID ANOUTWARD SHOW OF DISPLEASURE WHICH WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THEDISAGREEABLE POSSIBILITY
 IF ANY ONE HAD ASKED HIM WHY HE SHRANK INTHAT WAY I AM NOT SURE THAT HE WOULD AT FIRST HAVE SAID ANYTHINGFULLER OR MORE PRECISE THAN THAT LADISLAW
THOUGH ON REFLECTION HEMIGHT HAVE URGED THAT MR
 CASAUBONS CODICIL BARRING DOROTHEASMARRIAGE WITH WILL EXCEPT UNDER A PENALTY WAS ENOUGH TO CASTUNFITNESS OVER ANY RELATION AT ALL BETWEEN THEM
 HIS AVERSION WAS ALLTHE STRONGER BECAUSE HE FELT HIMSELF UNABLE TO INTERFERE
BUT SIR JAMES WAS A POWER IN A WAY UNGUESSED BY HIMSELF
 ENTERING ATTHAT MOMENT HE WAS AN INCORPORATION OF THE STRONGEST REASONS THROUGHWHICH WILLS PRIDE BECAME A REPELLENT FORCE KEEPING HIM ASUNDER FROMDOROTHEA
CHAPTER LV
HATH SHE HER FAULTS
 I WOULD YOU HAD THEM TOO
THEY ARE THE FRUITY MUST OF SOUNDEST WINEOR SAY THEY ARE REGENERATING FIRESUCH AS HATH TURNED THE DENSE BLACK ELEMENTINTO A CRYSTAL PATHWAY FOR THE SUN
IF YOUTH IS THE SEASON OF HOPE IT IS OFTEN SO ONLY IN THE SENSE THATOUR ELDERS ARE HOPEFUL ABOUT US FOR NO AGE IS SO APT AS YOUTH TO THINKITS EMOTIONS PARTINGS AND RESOLVES ARE THE LAST OF THEIR KIND
 EACHCRISIS SEEMS FINAL SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS NEW
 WE ARE TOLD THAT THEOLDEST INHABITANTS IN PERU DO NOT CEASE TO BE AGITATED BY THEEARTHQUAKES BUT THEY PROBABLY SEE BEYOND EACH SHOCK AND REFLECT THATTHERE ARE PLENTY MORE TO COME
TO DOROTHEA STILL IN THAT TIME OF YOUTH WHEN THE EYES WITH THEIR LONGFULL LASHES LOOK OUT AFTER THEIR RAIN OF TEARS UNSOILED AND UNWEARIEDAS A FRESHLY OPENED PASSIONFLOWER THAT MORNINGS PARTING WITH WILLLADISLAW SEEMED TO BE THE CLOSE OF THEIR PERSONAL RELATIONS
 HE WASGOING AWAY INTO THE DISTANCE OF UNKNOWN YEARS AND IF EVER HE CAME BACKHE WOULD BE ANOTHER MAN
 THE ACTUAL STATE OF HIS MINDHIS PROUD RESOLVETO GIVE THE LIE BEFOREHAND TO ANY SUSPICION THAT HE WOULD PLAY THENEEDY ADVENTURER SEEKING A RICH WOMANLAY QUITE OUT OF HER IMAGINATIONAND SHE HAD INTERPRETED ALL HIS BEHAVIOR EASILY ENOUGH BY HERSUPPOSITION THAT MR
 CASAUBONS CODICIL SEEMED TO HIM AS IT DID TOHER A GROSS AND CRUEL INTERDICT ON ANY ACTIVE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THEM
THEIR YOUNG DELIGHT IN SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER AND SAYING WHAT NO ONEELSE WOULD CARE TO HEAR WAS FOREVER ENDED AND BECOME A TREASURE OFTHE PAST
 FOR THIS VERY REASON SHE DWELT ON IT WITHOUT INWARD CHECK
THAT UNIQUE HAPPINESS TOO WAS DEAD AND IN ITS SHADOWED SILENT CHAMBERSHE MIGHT VENT THE PASSIONATE GRIEF WHICH SHE HERSELF WONDERED AT
 FORTHE FIRST TIME SHE TOOK DOWN THE MINIATURE FROM THE WALL AND KEPT ITBEFORE HER LIKING TO BLEND THE WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN TOO HARDLY JUDGEDWITH THE GRANDSON WHOM HER OWN HEART AND JUDGMENT DEFENDED
 CAN ANY ONEWHO HAS REJOICED IN WOMANS TENDERNESS THINK IT A REPROACH TO HER THATSHE TOOK THE LITTLE OVAL PICTURE IN HER PALM AND MADE A BED FOR ITTHERE AND LEANED HER CHEEK UPON IT AS IF THAT WOULD SOOTHE THECREATURES WHO HAD SUFFERED UNJUST CONDEMNATION
 SHE DID NOT KNOW THENTHAT IT WAS LOVE WHO HAD COME TO HER BRIEFLY AS IN A DREAM BEFOREAWAKING WITH THE HUES OF MORNING ON HIS WINGSTHAT IT WAS LOVE TO WHOMSHE WAS SOBBING HER FAREWELL AS HIS IMAGE WAS BANISHED BY THE BLAMELESSRIGOR OF IRRESISTIBLE DAY
 SHE ONLY FELT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHINGIRREVOCABLY AMISS AND LOST IN HER LOT AND HER THOUGHTS ABOUT THEFUTURE WERE THE MORE READILY SHAPEN INTO RESOLVE
 ARDENT SOULS READYTO CONSTRUCT THEIR COMING LIVES ARE APT TO COMMIT THEMSELVES TO THEFULFILMENT OF THEIR OWN VISIONS
ONE DAY THAT SHE WENT TO FRESHITT TO FULFIL HER PROMISE OF STAYING ALLNIGHT AND SEEING BABY WASHED MRS
 CADWALLADER CAME TO DINE THE RECTORBEING GONE ON A FISHING EXCURSION
 IT WAS A WARM EVENING AND EVEN INTHE DELIGHTFUL DRAWINGROOM WHERE THE FINE OLD TURF SLOPED FROM THEOPEN WINDOW TOWARDS A LILIED POOL AND WELLPLANTED MOUNDS THE HEAT WASENOUGH TO MAKE CELIA IN HER WHITE MUSLIN AND LIGHT CURLS REFLECT WITHPITY ON WHAT DODO MUST FEEL IN HER BLACK DRESS AND CLOSE CAP
 BUT THISWAS NOT UNTIL SOME EPISODES WITH BABY WERE OVER AND HAD LEFT HER MINDAT LEISURE
 SHE HAD SEATED HERSELF AND TAKEN UP A FAN FOR SOME TIMEBEFORE SHE SAID IN HER QUIET GUTTURALDEAR DODO DO THROW OFF THAT CAP
 I AM SURE YOUR DRESS MUST MAKE YOUFEEL ILL
I AM SO USED TO THE CAPIT HAS BECOME A SORT OF SHELL SAID DOROTHEASMILING
 I FEEL RATHER BARE AND EXPOSED WHEN IT IS OFF
I MUST SEE YOU WITHOUT IT IT MAKES US ALL WARM SAID CELIA THROWINGDOWN HER FAN AND GOING TO DOROTHEA
 IT WAS A PRETTY PICTURE TO SEETHIS LITTLE LADY IN WHITE MUSLIN UNFASTENING THE WIDOWS CAP FROM HERMORE MAJESTIC SISTER AND TOSSING IT ON TO A CHAIR
 JUST AS THE COILSAND BRAIDS OF DARKBROWN HAIR HAD BEEN SET FREE SIR JAMES ENTERED THEROOM
 HE LOOKED AT THE RELEASED HEAD AND SAID AH
 IN A TONE OFSATISFACTION
IT WAS I WHO DID IT JAMES SAID CELIA
 DODO NEED NOT MAKE SUCH ASLAVERY OF HER MOURNING SHE NEED NOT WEAR THAT CAP ANY MORE AMONG HERFRIENDS
MY DEAR CELIA SAID LADY CHETTAM A WIDOW MUST WEAR HER MOURNING ATLEAST A YEAR
NOT IF SHE MARRIES AGAIN BEFORE THE END OF IT SAID MRS
 CADWALLADERWHO HAD SOME PLEASURE IN STARTLING HER GOOD FRIEND THE DOWAGER
 SIRJAMES WAS ANNOYED AND LEANED FORWARD TO PLAY WITH CELIAS MALTESE DOG
THAT IS VERY RARE I HOPE SAID LADY CHETTAM IN A TONE INTENDED TOGUARD AGAINST SUCH EVENTS
 NO FRIEND OF OURS EVER COMMITTED HERSELF INTHAT WAY EXCEPT MRS
 BEEVOR AND IT WAS VERY PAINFUL TO LORD GRINSELLWHEN SHE DID SO
 HER FIRST HUSBAND WAS OBJECTIONABLE WHICH MADE IT THEGREATER WONDER
 AND SEVERELY SHE WAS PUNISHED FOR IT
 THEY SAID CAPTAINBEEVOR DRAGGED HER ABOUT BY THE HAIR AND HELD UP LOADED PISTOLS ATHER
OH IF SHE TOOK THE WRONG MAN
 SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER WHO WAS IN ADECIDEDLY WICKED MOOD
 MARRIAGE IS ALWAYS BAD THEN FIRST OR SECOND
PRIORITY IS A POOR RECOMMENDATION IN A HUSBAND IF HE HAS GOT NO OTHER
I WOULD RATHER HAVE A GOOD SECOND HUSBAND THAN AN INDIFFERENT FIRST
MY DEAR YOUR CLEVER TONGUE RUNS AWAY WITH YOU SAID LADY CHETTAM
 IAM SURE YOU WOULD BE THE LAST WOMAN TO MARRY AGAIN PREMATURELY IF OURDEAR RECTOR WERE TAKEN AWAY
OH I MAKE NO VOWS IT MIGHT BE A NECESSARY ECONOMY
 IT IS LAWFUL TOMARRY AGAIN I SUPPOSE ELSE WE MIGHT AS WELL BE HINDOOS INSTEAD OFCHRISTIANS
 OF COURSE IF A WOMAN ACCEPTS THE WRONG MAN SHE MUST TAKETHE CONSEQUENCES AND ONE WHO DOES IT TWICE OVER DESERVES HER FATE
 BUTIF SHE CAN MARRY BLOOD BEAUTY AND BRAVERYTHE SOONER THE BETTER
I THINK THE SUBJECT OF OUR CONVERSATION IS VERY ILLCHOSEN SAID SIRJAMES WITH A LOOK OF DISGUST
 SUPPOSE WE CHANGE IT
NOT ON MY ACCOUNT SIR JAMES SAID DOROTHEA DETERMINED NOT TO LOSETHE OPPORTUNITY OF FREEING HERSELF FROM CERTAIN OBLIQUE REFERENCES TOEXCELLENT MATCHES
 IF YOU ARE SPEAKING ON MY BEHALF I CAN ASSURE YOUTHAT NO QUESTION CAN BE MORE INDIFFERENT AND IMPERSONAL TO ME THANSECOND MARRIAGE
 IT IS NO MORE TO ME THAN IF YOU TALKED OF WOMEN GOINGFOXHUNTING WHETHER IT IS ADMIRABLE IN THEM OR NOT I SHALL NOT FOLLOWTHEM
 PRAY LET MRS
 CADWALLADER AMUSE HERSELF ON THAT SUBJECT AS MUCHAS ON ANY OTHER
MY DEAR MRS
 CASAUBON SAID LADY CHETTAM IN HER STATELIEST WAY YOUDO NOT I HOPE THINK THERE WAS ANY ALLUSION TO YOU IN MY MENTIONINGMRS
 BEEVOR
 IT WAS ONLY AN INSTANCE THAT OCCURRED TO ME
 SHE WASSTEPDAUGHTER TO LORD GRINSELL HE MARRIED MRS
 TEVEROY FOR HIS SECONDWIFE
 THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBLE ALLUSION TO YOU
OH NO SAID CELIA
 NOBODY CHOSE THE SUBJECT IT ALL CAME OUT OFDODOS CAP
 MRS
 CADWALLADER ONLY SAID WHAT WAS QUITE TRUE
 A WOMANCOULD NOT BE MARRIED IN A WIDOWS CAP JAMES
HUSH MY DEAR
 SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER
 I WILL NOT OFFEND AGAIN
 IWILL NOT EVEN REFER TO DIDO OR ZENOBIA
 ONLY WHAT ARE WE TO TALK ABOUT
I FOR MY PART OBJECT TO THE DISCUSSION OF HUMAN NATURE BECAUSE THATIS THE NATURE OF RECTORS WIVES
LATER IN THE EVENING AFTER MRS
 CADWALLADER WAS GONE CELIA SAIDPRIVATELY TO DOROTHEA REALLY DODO TAKING YOUR CAP OFF MADE YOU LIKEYOURSELF AGAIN IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE
 YOU SPOKE UP JUST AS YOU USED TODO WHEN ANYTHING WAS SAID TO DISPLEASE YOU
 BUT I COULD HARDLY MAKEOUT WHETHER IT WAS JAMES THAT YOU THOUGHT WRONG OR MRS
 CADWALLADER
NEITHER SAID DOROTHEA
 JAMES SPOKE OUT OF DELICACY TO ME BUT HEWAS MISTAKEN IN SUPPOSING THAT I MINDED WHAT MRS
 CADWALLADER SAID
 ISHOULD ONLY MIND IF THERE WERE A LAW OBLIGING ME TO TAKE ANY PIECE OFBLOOD AND BEAUTY THAT SHE OR ANYBODY ELSE RECOMMENDED
BUT YOU KNOW DODO IF YOU EVER DID MARRY IT WOULD BE ALL THE BETTERTO HAVE BLOOD AND BEAUTY SAID CELIA REFLECTING THAT MR
 CASAUBON HADNOT BEEN RICHLY ENDOWED WITH THOSE GIFTS AND THAT IT WOULD BE WELL TOCAUTION DOROTHEA IN TIME
DONT BE ANXIOUS KITTY I HAVE QUITE OTHER THOUGHTS ABOUT MY LIFE
 ISHALL NEVER MARRY AGAIN SAID DOROTHEA TOUCHING HER SISTERS CHINAND LOOKING AT HER WITH INDULGENT AFFECTION
 CELIA WAS NURSING HERBABY AND DOROTHEA HAD COME TO SAY GOODNIGHT TO HER
REALLYQUITE
 SAID CELIA
 NOT ANYBODY AT ALLIF HE WERE VERYWONDERFUL INDEED
DOROTHEA SHOOK HER HEAD SLOWLY
 NOT ANYBODY AT ALL
 I HAVE DELIGHTFULPLANS
 I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE A GREAT DEAL OF LAND AND DRAIN IT ANDMAKE A LITTLE COLONY WHERE EVERYBODY SHOULD WORK AND ALL THE WORKSHOULD BE DONE WELL
 I SHOULD KNOW EVERY ONE OF THE PEOPLE AND BE THEIRFRIEND
 I AM GOING TO HAVE GREAT CONSULTATIONS WITH MR
 GARTH HE CANTELL ME ALMOST EVERYTHING I WANT TO KNOW
THEN YOU WILL BE HAPPY IF YOU HAVE A PLAN DODO
 SAID CELIA
PERHAPS LITTLE ARTHUR WILL LIKE PLANS WHEN HE GROWS UP AND THEN HECAN HELP YOU
SIR JAMES WAS INFORMED THAT SAME NIGHT THAT DOROTHEA WAS REALLY QUITESET AGAINST MARRYING ANYBODY AT ALL AND WAS GOING TO TAKE TO ALLSORTS OF PLANS JUST LIKE WHAT SHE USED TO HAVE
 SIR JAMES MADE NOREMARK
 TO HIS SECRET FEELING THERE WAS SOMETHING REPULSIVE IN AWOMANS SECOND MARRIAGE AND NO MATCH WOULD PREVENT HIM FROM FEELING ITA SORT OF DESECRATION FOR DOROTHEA
 HE WAS AWARE THAT THE WORLD WOULDREGARD SUCH A SENTIMENT AS PREPOSTEROUS ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO AWOMAN OF ONEANDTWENTY THE PRACTICE OF THE WORLD BEING TO TREAT OFA YOUNG WIDOWS SECOND MARRIAGE AS CERTAIN AND PROBABLY NEAR AND TOSMILE WITH MEANING IF THE WIDOW ACTS ACCORDINGLY
 BUT IF DOROTHEA DIDCHOOSE TO ESPOUSE HER SOLITUDE HE FELT THAT THE RESOLUTION WOULD WELLBECOME HER
CHAPTER LVI
HOW HAPPY IS HE BORN AND TAUGHTTHAT SERVETH NOT ANOTHERS WILLWHOSE ARMOR IS HIS HONEST THOUGHTAND SIMPLE TRUTH HIS ONLY SKILL
 
 
 
 
 
 
THIS MAN IS FREED FROM SERVILE BANDSOF HOPE TO RISE OR FEAR TO FALLLORD OF HIMSELF THOUGH NOT OF LANDSAND HAVING NOTHING YET HATH ALL
SIR HENRY WOTTON
DOROTHEAS CONFIDENCE IN CALEB GARTHS KNOWLEDGE WHICH HAD BEGUN ONHER HEARING THAT HE APPROVED OF HER COTTAGES HAD GROWN FAST DURING HERSTAY AT FRESHITT SIR JAMES HAVING INDUCED HER TO TAKE RIDES OVER THETWO ESTATES IN COMPANY WITH HIMSELF AND CALEB WHO QUITE RETURNED HERADMIRATION AND TOLD HIS WIFE THAT MRS
 CASAUBON HAD A HEAD FORBUSINESS MOST UNCOMMON IN A WOMAN
 IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT BYBUSINESS CALEB NEVER MEANT MONEY TRANSACTIONS BUT THE SKILFULAPPLICATION OF LABOR
MOST UNCOMMON
 REPEATED CALEB
 SHE SAID A THING I OFTEN USED TOTHINK MYSELF WHEN I WAS A LADMR
 GARTH I SHOULD LIKE TO FEEL IF ILIVED TO BE OLD THAT I HAD IMPROVED A GREAT PIECE OF LAND AND BUILT AGREAT MANY GOOD COTTAGES BECAUSE THE WORK IS OF A HEALTHY KIND WHILEIT IS BEING DONE AND AFTER IT IS DONE MEN ARE THE BETTER FOR IT
THOSE WERE THE VERY WORDS SHE SEES INTO THINGS IN THAT WAY
BUT WOMANLY I HOPE SAID MRS
 GARTH HALF SUSPECTING THAT MRS
CASAUBON MIGHT NOT HOLD THE TRUE PRINCIPLE OF SUBORDINATION
OH YOU CANT THINK
 SAID CALEB SHAKING HIS HEAD
 YOU WOULD LIKE TOHEAR HER SPEAK SUSAN
 SHE SPEAKS IN SUCH PLAIN WORDS AND A VOICE LIKEMUSIC
 BLESS ME
 IT REMINDS ME OF BITS IN THE MESSIAHANDSTRAIGHTWAY THERE APPEARED A MULTITUDE OF THE HEAVENLY HOST PRAISINGGOD AND SAYING IT HAS A TONE WITH IT THAT SATISFIES YOUR EAR
CALEB WAS VERY FOND OF MUSIC AND WHEN HE COULD AFFORD IT WENT TO HEARAN ORATORIO THAT CAME WITHIN HIS REACH RETURNING FROM IT WITH APROFOUND REVERENCE FOR THIS MIGHTY STRUCTURE OF TONES WHICH MADE HIMSIT MEDITATIVELY LOOKING ON THE FLOOR AND THROWING MUCH UNUTTERABLELANGUAGE INTO HIS OUTSTRETCHED HANDS
WITH THIS GOOD UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THEM IT WAS NATURAL THAT DOROTHEAASKED MR
 GARTH TO UNDERTAKE ANY BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH THE THREEFARMS AND THE NUMEROUS TENEMENTS ATTACHED TO LOWICK MANOR INDEED HISEXPECTATION OF GETTING WORK FOR TWO WAS BEING FAST FULFILLED
 AS HESAID BUSINESS BREEDS
 AND ONE FORM OF BUSINESS WHICH WAS BEGINNINGTO BREED JUST THEN WAS THE CONSTRUCTION OF RAILWAYS
 A PROJECTED LINEWAS TO RUN THROUGH LOWICK PARISH WHERE THE CATTLE HAD HITHERTO GRAZEDIN A PEACE UNBROKEN BY ASTONISHMENT AND THUS IT HAPPENED THAT THEINFANT STRUGGLES OF THE RAILWAY SYSTEM ENTERED INTO THE AFFAIRS OFCALEB GARTH AND DETERMINED THE COURSE OF THIS HISTORY WITH REGARD TOTWO PERSONS WHO WERE DEAR TO HIM
 THE SUBMARINE RAILWAY MAY HAVE ITSDIFFICULTIES BUT THE BED OF THE SEA IS NOT DIVIDED AMONG VARIOUSLANDED PROPRIETORS WITH CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES NOT ONLY MEASURABLE BUTSENTIMENTAL
 IN THE HUNDRED TO WHICH MIDDLEMARCH BELONGED RAILWAYS WEREAS EXCITING A TOPIC AS THE REFORM BILL OR THE IMMINENT HORRORS OFCHOLERA AND THOSE WHO HELD THE MOST DECIDED VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT WEREWOMEN AND LANDHOLDERS
 WOMEN BOTH OLD AND YOUNG REGARDED TRAVELLING BYSTEAM AS PRESUMPTUOUS AND DANGEROUS AND ARGUED AGAINST IT BY SAYINGTHAT NOTHING SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO GET INTO A RAILWAY CARRIAGE WHILEPROPRIETORS DIFFERING FROM EACH OTHER IN THEIR ARGUMENTS AS MUCH ASMR
 SOLOMON FEATHERSTONE DIFFERED FROM LORD MEDLICOTE WERE YETUNANIMOUS IN THE OPINION THAT IN SELLING LAND WHETHER TO THE ENEMY OFMANKIND OR TO A COMPANY OBLIGED TO PURCHASE THESE PERNICIOUS AGENCIESMUST BE MADE TO PAY A VERY HIGH PRICE TO LANDOWNERS FOR PERMISSION TOINJURE MANKIND
BUT THE SLOWER WITS SUCH AS MR
 SOLOMON AND MRS
 WAULE WHO BOTHOCCUPIED LAND OF THEIR OWN TOOK A LONG TIME TO ARRIVE AT THISCONCLUSION THEIR MINDS HALTING AT THE VIVID CONCEPTION OF WHAT ITWOULD BE TO CUT THE BIG PASTURE IN TWO AND TURN IT INTO THREECORNEREDBITS WHICH WOULD BE NOHOW WHILE ACCOMMODATIONBRIDGES AND HIGHPAYMENTS WERE REMOTE AND INCREDIBLE
THE COWS WILL ALL CAST THEIR CALVES BROTHER SAID MRS
 WAULE IN ATONE OF DEEP MELANCHOLY IF THE RAILWAY COMES ACROSS THE NEAR CLOSEAND I SHOULDNT WONDER AT THE MARE TOO IF SHE WAS IN FOAL
 ITS A POORTALE IF A WIDOWS PROPERTY IS TO BE SPADED AWAY AND THE LAW SAYNOTHING TO IT
 WHATS TO HINDER EM FROM CUTTING RIGHT AND LEFT IF THEYBEGIN
 ITS WELL KNOWN I CANT FIGHT
THE BEST WAY WOULD BE TO SAY NOTHING AND SET SOMEBODY ON TO SEND EMAWAY WITH A FLEA IN THEIR EAR WHEN THEY CAME SPYING AND MEASURINGSAID SOLOMON
 FOLKS DID THAT ABOUT BRASSING BY WHAT I CAN UNDERSTAND
ITS ALL A PRETENCE IF THE TRUTH WAS KNOWN ABOUT THEIR BEING FORCEDTO TAKE ONE WAY
 LET EM GO CUTTING IN ANOTHER PARISH
 AND I DONTBELIEVE IN ANY PAY TO MAKE AMENDS FOR BRINGING A LOT OF RUFFIANS TOTRAMPLE YOUR CROPS
 WHERES A COMPANYS POCKET
BROTHER PETER GOD FORGIVE HIM GOT MONEY OUT OF A COMPANY SAID MRS
WAULE
 BUT THAT WAS FOR THE MANGANESE
 THAT WASNT FOR RAILWAYS TOBLOW YOU TO PIECES RIGHT AND LEFT
WELL THERES THIS TO BE SAID JANE MR
 SOLOMON CONCLUDED LOWERINGHIS VOICE IN A CAUTIOUS MANNERTHE MORE SPOKES WE PUT IN THEIR WHEELTHE MORE THEYLL PAY US TO LET EM GO ON IF THEY MUST COME WHETHER ORNOT
THIS REASONING OF MR
 SOLOMONS WAS PERHAPS LESS THOROUGH THAN HEIMAGINED HIS CUNNING BEARING ABOUT THE SAME RELATION TO THE COURSE OFRAILWAYS AS THE CUNNING OF A DIPLOMATIST BEARS TO THE GENERAL CHILL ORCATARRH OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 BUT HE SET ABOUT ACTING ON HIS VIEWS IN ATHOROUGHLY DIPLOMATIC MANNER BY STIMULATING SUSPICION
 HIS SIDE OFLOWICK WAS THE MOST REMOTE FROM THE VILLAGE AND THE HOUSES OF THELABORING PEOPLE WERE EITHER LONE COTTAGES OR WERE COLLECTED IN A HAMLETCALLED FRICK WHERE A WATERMILL AND SOME STONEPITS MADE A LITTLECENTRE OF SLOW HEAVYSHOULDERED INDUSTRY
IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY PRECISE IDEA AS TO WHAT RAILWAYS WERE PUBLICOPINION IN FRICK WAS AGAINST THEM FOR THE HUMAN MIND IN THAT GRASSYCORNER HAD NOT THE PROVERBIAL TENDENCY TO ADMIRE THE UNKNOWN HOLDINGRATHER THAT IT WAS LIKELY TO BE AGAINST THE POOR MAN AND THATSUSPICION WAS THE ONLY WISE ATTITUDE WITH REGARD TO IT
 EVEN THE RUMOROF REFORM HAD NOT YET EXCITED ANY MILLENNIAL EXPECTATIONS IN FRICKTHERE BEING NO DEFINITE PROMISE IN IT AS OF GRATUITOUS GRAINS TOFATTEN HIRAM FORDS PIG OR OF A PUBLICAN AT THE WEIGHTS AND SCALESWHO WOULD BREW BEER FOR NOTHING OR OF AN OFFER ON THE PART OF THETHREE NEIGHBORING FARMERS TO RAISE WAGES DURING WINTER
 AND WITHOUTDISTINCT GOOD OF THIS KIND IN ITS PROMISES REFORM SEEMED ON A FOOTINGWITH THE BRAGGING OF PEDLERS WHICH WAS A HINT FOR DISTRUST TO EVERYKNOWING PERSON
 THE MEN OF FRICK WERE NOT ILLFED AND WERE LESS GIVENTO FANATICISM THAN TO A STRONG MUSCULAR SUSPICION LESS INCLINED TOBELIEVE THAT THEY WERE PECULIARLY CARED FOR BY HEAVEN THAN TO REGARDHEAVEN ITSELF AS RATHER DISPOSED TO TAKE THEM INA DISPOSITIONOBSERVABLE IN THE WEATHER
THUS THE MIND OF FRICK WAS EXACTLY OF THE SORT FOR MR
 SOLOMONFEATHERSTONE TO WORK UPON HE HAVING MORE PLENTEOUS IDEAS OF THE SAMEORDER WITH A SUSPICION OF HEAVEN AND EARTH WHICH WAS BETTER FED ANDMORE ENTIRELY AT LEISURE
 SOLOMON WAS OVERSEER OF THE ROADS AT THATTIME AND ON HIS SLOWPACED COB OFTEN TOOK HIS ROUNDS BY FRICK TO LOOKAT THE WORKMEN GETTING THE STONES THERE PAUSING WITH A MYSTERIOUSDELIBERATION WHICH MIGHT HAVE MISLED YOU INTO SUPPOSING THAT HE HADSOME OTHER REASON FOR STAYING THAN THE MERE WANT OF IMPULSE TO MOVE
AFTER LOOKING FOR A LONG WHILE AT ANY WORK THAT WAS GOING ON HE WOULDRAISE HIS EYES A LITTLE AND LOOK AT THE HORIZON FINALLY HE WOULD SHAKEHIS BRIDLE TOUCH HIS HORSE WITH THE WHIP AND GET IT TO MOVE SLOWLYONWARD
 THE HOURHAND OF A CLOCK WAS QUICK BY COMPARISON WITH MR
SOLOMON WHO HAD AN AGREEABLE SENSE THAT HE COULD AFFORD TO BE SLOW
 HEWAS IN THE HABIT OF PAUSING FOR A CAUTIOUS VAGUELY DESIGNING CHAT WITHEVERY HEDGER OR DITCHER ON HIS WAY AND WAS ESPECIALLY WILLING TOLISTEN EVEN TO NEWS WHICH HE HAD HEARD BEFORE FEELING HIMSELF AT ANADVANTAGE OVER ALL NARRATORS IN PARTIALLY DISBELIEVING THEM
 ONE DAYHOWEVER HE GOT INTO A DIALOGUE WITH HIRAM FORD A WAGONER IN WHICH HEHIMSELF CONTRIBUTED INFORMATION
 HE WISHED TO KNOW WHETHER HIRAM HADSEEN FELLOWS WITH STAVES AND INSTRUMENTS SPYING ABOUT THEY CALLEDTHEMSELVES RAILROAD PEOPLE BUT THERE WAS NO TELLING WHAT THEY WERE ORWHAT THEY MEANT TO DO
 THE LEAST THEY PRETENDED WAS THAT THEY WEREGOING TO CUT LOWICK PARISH INTO SIXES AND SEVENS
WHY THERELL BE NO STIRRIN FROM ONE PLAACE TO ANOTHER SAID HIRAMTHINKING OF HIS WAGON AND HORSES
NOT A BIT SAID MR
 SOLOMON
 AND CUTTING UP FINE LAND SUCH AS THISPARISH
 LET EM GO INTO TIPTON SAY I
 BUT THERES NO KNOWING WHATTHERE IS AT THE BOTTOM OF IT
 TRAFFIC IS WHAT THEY PUT FORARD BUTITS TO DO HARM TO THE LAND AND THE POOR MAN IN THE LONGRUN
WHY THEYRE LUNNON CHAPS I RECKON SAID HIRAM WHO HAD A DIM NOTIONOF LONDON AS A CENTRE OF HOSTILITY TO THE COUNTRY
AY TO BE SURE
 AND IN SOME PARTS AGAINST BRASSING BY WHAT IVE HEARDSAY THE FOLKS FELL ON EM WHEN THEY WERE SPYING AND BROKE THEIRPEEPHOLES AS THEY CARRY AND DROVE EM AWAY SO AS THEY KNEW BETTERTHAN COME AGAIN
IT WAR GOOD FOON ID BE BOUND SAID HIRAM WHOSE FUN WAS MUCHRESTRICTED BY CIRCUMSTANCES
WELL I WOULDNT MEDDLE WITH EM MYSELF SAID SOLOMON
 BUT SOME SAYTHIS COUNTRYS SEEN ITS BEST DAYS AND THE SIGN IS AS ITS BEINGOVERRUN WITH THESE FELLOWS TRAMPLING RIGHT AND LEFT AND WANTING TO CUTIT UP INTO RAILWAYS AND ALL FOR THE BIG TRAFFIC TO SWALLOW UP THELITTLE SO AS THERE SHANT BE A TEAM LEFT ON THE LAND NOR A WHIP TOCRACK
ILL CRACK MY WHIP ABOUT THEIR EARN AFORE THEY BRING IT TO THATTHOUGH SAID HIRAM WHILE MR
 SOLOMON SHAKING HIS BRIDLE MOVEDONWARD
NETTLESEED NEEDS NO DIGGING
 THE RUIN OF THIS COUNTRYSIDE BY RAILROADSWAS DISCUSSED NOT ONLY AT THE WEIGHTS AND SCALES BUT IN THEHAYFIELD WHERE THE MUSTER OF WORKING HANDS GAVE OPPORTUNITIES FORTALK SUCH AS WERE RARELY HAD THROUGH THE RURAL YEAR
ONE MORNING NOT LONG AFTER THAT INTERVIEW BETWEEN MR
 FAREBROTHER ANDMARY GARTH IN WHICH SHE CONFESSED TO HIM HER FEELING FOR FRED VINCYIT HAPPENED THAT HER FATHER HAD SOME BUSINESS WHICH TOOK HIM TOYODDRELLS FARM IN THE DIRECTION OF FRICK IT WAS TO MEASURE AND VALUEAN OUTLYING PIECE OF LAND BELONGING TO LOWICK MANOR WHICH CALEBEXPECTED TO DISPOSE OF ADVANTAGEOUSLY FOR DOROTHEA IT MUST BECONFESSED THAT HIS BIAS WAS TOWARDS GETTING THE BEST POSSIBLE TERMSFROM RAILROAD COMPANIES
 HE PUT UP HIS GIG AT YODDRELLS AND INWALKING WITH HIS ASSISTANT AND MEASURINGCHAIN TO THE SCENE OF HISWORK HE ENCOUNTERED THE PARTY OF THE COMPANYS AGENTS WHO WEREADJUSTING THEIR SPIRITLEVEL
 AFTER A LITTLE CHAT HE LEFT THEMOBSERVING THAT BYANDBY THEY WOULD REACH HIM AGAIN WHERE HE WAS GOINGTO MEASURE
 IT WAS ONE OF THOSE GRAY MORNINGS AFTER LIGHT RAINS WHICHBECOME DELICIOUS ABOUT TWELVE OCLOCK WHEN THE CLOUDS PART A LITTLEAND THE SCENT OF THE EARTH IS SWEET ALONG THE LANES AND BY THEHEDGEROWS
THE SCENT WOULD HAVE BEEN SWEETER TO FRED VINCY WHO WAS COMING ALONGTHE LANES ON HORSEBACK IF HIS MIND HAD NOT BEEN WORRIED BYUNSUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO IMAGINE WHAT HE WAS TO DO WITH HIS FATHER ONONE SIDE EXPECTING HIM STRAIGHTWAY TO ENTER THE CHURCH WITH MARY ONTHE OTHER THREATENING TO FORSAKE HIM IF HE DID ENTER IT AND WITH THEWORKINGDAY WORLD SHOWING NO EAGER NEED WHATEVER OF A YOUNG GENTLEMANWITHOUT CAPITAL AND GENERALLY UNSKILLED
 IT WAS THE HARDER TO FREDSDISPOSITION BECAUSE HIS FATHER SATISFIED THAT HE WAS NO LONGERREBELLIOUS WAS IN GOOD HUMOR WITH HIM AND HAD SENT HIM ON THISPLEASANT RIDE TO SEE AFTER SOME GREYHOUNDS
 EVEN WHEN HE HAD FIXED ONWHAT HE SHOULD DO THERE WOULD BE THE TASK OF TELLING HIS FATHER
 BUTIT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT THE FIXING WHICH HAD TO COME FIRST WAS THEMORE DIFFICULT TASKWHAT SECULAR AVOCATION ON EARTH WAS THERE FOR AYOUNG MAN WHOSE FRIENDS COULD NOT GET HIM AN APPOINTMENT WHICH WASAT ONCE GENTLEMANLY LUCRATIVE AND TO BE FOLLOWED WITHOUT SPECIALKNOWLEDGE
 RIDING ALONG THE LANES BY FRICK IN THIS MOOD AND SLACKENINGHIS PACE WHILE HE REFLECTED WHETHER HE SHOULD VENTURE TO GO ROUND BYLOWICK PARSONAGE TO CALL ON MARY HE COULD SEE OVER THE HEDGES FROM ONEFIELD TO ANOTHER
 SUDDENLY A NOISE ROUSED HIS ATTENTION AND ON THE FARSIDE OF A FIELD ON HIS LEFT HAND HE COULD SEE SIX OR SEVEN MEN INSMOCKFROCKS WITH HAYFORKS IN THEIR HANDS MAKING AN OFFENSIVE APPROACHTOWARDS THE FOUR RAILWAY AGENTS WHO WERE FACING THEM WHILE CALEB GARTHAND HIS ASSISTANT WERE HASTENING ACROSS THE FIELD TO JOIN THETHREATENED GROUP
 FRED DELAYED A FEW MOMENTS BY HAVING TO FIND THEGATE COULD NOT GALLOP UP TO THE SPOT BEFORE THE PARTY IN SMOCKFROCKSWHOSE WORK OF TURNING THE HAY HAD NOT BEEN TOO PRESSING AFTERSWALLOWING THEIR MIDDAY BEER WERE DRIVING THE MEN IN COATS BEFORETHEM WITH THEIR HAYFORKS WHILE CALEB GARTHS ASSISTANT A LAD OFSEVENTEEN WHO HAD SNATCHED UP THE SPIRITLEVEL AT CALEBS ORDER HADBEEN KNOCKED DOWN AND SEEMED TO BE LYING HELPLESS
 THE COATED MEN HADTHE ADVANTAGE AS RUNNERS AND FRED COVERED THEIR RETREAT BY GETTING INFRONT OF THE SMOCKFROCKS AND CHARGING THEM SUDDENLY ENOUGH TO THROWTHEIR CHASE INTO CONFUSION
 WHAT DO YOU CONFOUNDED FOOLS MEAN
SHOUTED FRED PURSUING THE DIVIDED GROUP IN A ZIGZAG AND CUTTING RIGHTAND LEFT WITH HIS WHIP
 ILL SWEAR TO EVERY ONE OF YOU BEFORE THEMAGISTRATE
 YOUVE KNOCKED THE LAD DOWN AND KILLED HIM FOR WHAT IKNOW
 YOULL EVERY ONE OF YOU BE HANGED AT THE NEXT ASSIZES IF YOUDONT MIND SAID FRED WHO AFTERWARDS LAUGHED HEARTILY AS HEREMEMBERED HIS OWN PHRASES
THE LABORERS HAD BEEN DRIVEN THROUGH THE GATEWAY INTO THEIR HAYFIELDAND FRED HAD CHECKED HIS HORSE WHEN HIRAM FORD OBSERVING HIMSELF AT ASAFE CHALLENGING DISTANCE TURNED BACK AND SHOUTED A DEFIANCE WHICH HEDID NOT KNOW TO BE HOMERIC
YORE A COWARD YO ARE
 YO GIT OFF YOUR HORSE YOUNG MEASTER AND ILLHAVE A ROUND WI YE I WULL
 YO DAREDNT COME ON WIOUT YOUR HOSS ANWHIP
 ID SOON KNOCK THE BREATH OUT ON YE I WOULD
WAIT A MINUTE AND ILL COME BACK PRESENTLY AND HAVE A ROUND WITH YOUALL IN TURN IF YOU LIKE SAID FRED WHO FELT CONFIDENCE IN HIS POWEROF BOXING WITH HIS DEARLY BELOVED BRETHREN
 BUT JUST NOW HE WANTED TOHASTEN BACK TO CALEB AND THE PROSTRATE YOUTH
THE LADS ANKLE WAS STRAINED AND HE WAS IN MUCH PAIN FROM IT BUT HEWAS NO FURTHER HURT AND FRED PLACED HIM ON THE HORSE THAT HE MIGHTRIDE TO YODDRELLS AND BE TAKEN CARE OF THERE
LET THEM PUT THE HORSE IN THE STABLE AND TELL THE SURVEYORS THEY CANCOME BACK FOR THEIR TRAPS SAID FRED
 THE GROUND IS CLEAR NOW
NO NO SAID CALEB HERES A BREAKAGE
 THEYLL HAVE TO GIVE UP FORTODAY AND IT WILL BE AS WELL
 HERE TAKE THE THINGS BEFORE YOU ON THEHORSE TOM
 THEYLL SEE YOU COMING AND THEYLL TURN BACK
IM GLAD I HAPPENED TO BE HERE AT THE RIGHT MOMENT MR
 GARTH SAIDFRED AS TOM RODE AWAY
 NO KNOWING WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IF THECAVALRY HAD NOT COME UP IN TIME
AY AY IT WAS LUCKY SAID CALEB SPEAKING RATHER ABSENTLY ANDLOOKING TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE HE HAD BEEN AT WORK AT THE MOMENT OFINTERRUPTION
 BUTDEUCE TAKE ITTHIS IS WHAT COMES OF MEN BEINGFOOLSIM HINDERED OF MY DAYS WORK
 I CANT GET ALONG WITHOUT SOMEBODYTO HELP ME WITH THE MEASURINGCHAIN
 HOWEVER
 HE WAS BEGINNING TO MOVETOWARDS THE SPOT WITH A LOOK OF VEXATION AS IF HE HAD FORGOTTEN FREDSPRESENCE BUT SUDDENLY HE TURNED ROUND AND SAID QUICKLY WHAT HAVE YOUGOT TO DO TODAY YOUNG FELLOW
NOTHING MR
 GARTH
 ILL HELP YOU WITH PLEASURECAN I
 SAID FREDWITH A SENSE THAT HE SHOULD BE COURTING MARY WHEN HE WAS HELPING HERFATHER
WELL YOU MUSTNT MIND STOOPING AND GETTING HOT
I DONT MIND ANYTHING
 ONLY I WANT TO GO FIRST AND HAVE A ROUND WITHTHAT HULKY FELLOW WHO TURNED TO CHALLENGE ME
 IT WOULD BE A GOOD LESSONFOR HIM
 I SHALL NOT BE FIVE MINUTES
NONSENSE
 SAID CALEB WITH HIS MOST PEREMPTORY INTONATION
 I SHALLGO AND SPEAK TO THE MEN MYSELF
 ITS ALL IGNORANCE
 SOMEBODY HAS BEENTELLING THEM LIES
 THE POOR FOOLS DONT KNOW ANY BETTER
I SHALL GO WITH YOU THEN SAID FRED
NO NO STAY WHERE YOU ARE
 I DONT WANT YOUR YOUNG BLOOD
 I CAN TAKECARE OF MYSELF
CALEB WAS A POWERFUL MAN AND KNEW LITTLE OF ANY FEAR EXCEPT THE FEAR OFHURTING OTHERS AND THE FEAR OF HAVING TO SPEECHIFY
 BUT HE FELT IT HISDUTY AT THIS MOMENT TO TRY AND GIVE A LITTLE HARANGUE
 THERE WAS ASTRIKING MIXTURE IN HIMWHICH CAME FROM HIS HAVING ALWAYS BEEN AHARDWORKING MAN HIMSELFOF RIGOROUS NOTIONS ABOUT WORKMEN ANDPRACTICAL INDULGENCE TOWARDS THEM
 TO DO A GOOD DAYS WORK AND TO DO ITWELL HE HELD TO BE PART OF THEIR WELFARE AS IT WAS THE CHIEF PART OFHIS OWN HAPPINESS BUT HE HAD A STRONG SENSE OF FELLOWSHIP WITH THEM
WHEN HE ADVANCED TOWARDS THE LABORERS THEY HAD NOT GONE TO WORK AGAINBUT WERE STANDING IN THAT FORM OF RURAL GROUPING WHICH CONSISTS IN EACHTURNING A SHOULDER TOWARDS THE OTHER AT A DISTANCE OF TWO OR THREEYARDS
 THEY LOOKED RATHER SULKILY AT CALEB WHO WALKED QUICKLY WITH ONEHAND IN HIS POCKET AND THE OTHER THRUST BETWEEN THE BUTTONS OF HISWAISTCOAT AND HAD HIS EVERYDAY MILD AIR WHEN HE PAUSED AMONG THEM
WHY MY LADS HOWS THIS
 HE BEGAN TAKING AS USUAL TO BRIEF PHRASESWHICH SEEMED PREGNANT TO HIMSELF BECAUSE HE HAD MANY THOUGHTS LYINGUNDER THEM LIKE THE ABUNDANT ROOTS OF A PLANT THAT JUST MANAGES TOPEEP ABOVE THE WATER
 HOW CAME YOU TO MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE AS THIS
SOMEBODY HAS BEEN TELLING YOU LIES
 YOU THOUGHT THOSE MEN UP THEREWANTED TO DO MISCHIEF
AW
 WAS THE ANSWER DROPPED AT INTERVALS BY EACH ACCORDING TO HISDEGREE OF UNREADINESS
NONSENSE
 NO SUCH THING
 THEYRE LOOKING OUT TO SEE WHICH WAY THERAILROAD IS TO TAKE
 NOW MY LADS YOU CANT HINDER THE RAILROAD ITWILL BE MADE WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT
 AND IF YOU GO FIGHTING AGAINSTIT YOULL GET YOURSELVES INTO TROUBLE
 THE LAW GIVES THOSE MEN LEAVETO COME HERE ON THE LAND
 THE OWNER HAS NOTHING TO SAY AGAINST IT ANDIF YOU MEDDLE WITH THEM YOULL HAVE TO DO WITH THE CONSTABLE ANDJUSTICE BLAKESLEY AND WITH THE HANDCUFFS AND MIDDLEMARCH JAIL
 AND YOUMIGHT BE IN FOR IT NOW IF ANYBODY INFORMED AGAINST YOU
CALEB PAUSED HERE AND PERHAPS THE GREATEST ORATOR COULD NOT HAVECHOSEN EITHER HIS PAUSE OR HIS IMAGES BETTER FOR THE OCCASION
BUT COME YOU DIDNT MEAN ANY HARM
 SOMEBODY TOLD YOU THE RAILROAD WASA BAD THING
 THAT WAS A LIE
 IT MAY DO A BIT OF HARM HERE AND THERE TOTHIS AND TO THAT AND SO DOES THE SUN IN HEAVEN
 BUT THE RAILWAYS AGOOD THING
AW

TIMOTHY WAS A WIRY OLD LABORER OF A TYPE LINGERING IN THOSE TIMESWHOHAD HIS SAVINGS IN A STOCKINGFOOT LIVED IN A LONE COTTAGE AND WASNOT TO BE WROUGHT ON BY ANY ORATORY HAVING AS LITTLE OF THE FEUDALSPIRIT AND BELIEVING AS LITTLE AS IF HE HAD NOT BEEN TOTALLYUNACQUAINTED WITH THE AGE OF REASON AND THE RIGHTS OF MAN
 CALEB WAS INA DIFFICULTY KNOWN TO ANY PERSON ATTEMPTING IN DARK TIMES ANDUNASSISTED BY MIRACLE TO REASON WITH RUSTICS WHO ARE IN POSSESSION OFAN UNDENIABLE TRUTH WHICH THEY KNOW THROUGH A HARD PROCESS OF FEELINGAND CAN LET IT FALL LIKE A GIANTS CLUB ON YOUR NEATLY CARVED ARGUMENTFOR A SOCIAL BENEFIT WHICH THEY DO NOT FEEL
 CALEB HAD NO CANT ATCOMMAND EVEN IF HE COULD HAVE CHOSEN TO USE IT AND HE HAD BEENACCUSTOMED TO MEET ALL SUCH DIFFICULTIES IN NO OTHER WAY THAN BY DOINGHIS BUSINESS FAITHFULLY

THEY WENT TO WORK AND FRED HELPED VIGOROUSLY
 HIS SPIRITS HAD RISENAND HE HEARTILY ENJOYED A GOOD SLIP IN THE MOIST EARTH UNDER THEHEDGEROW WHICH SOILED HIS PERFECT SUMMER TROUSERS
 WAS IT HISSUCCESSFUL ONSET WHICH HAD ELATED HIM OR THE SATISFACTION OF HELPINGMARYS FATHER
 SOMETHING MORE
 THE ACCIDENTS OF THE MORNING HAD HELPEDHIS FRUSTRATED IMAGINATION TO SHAPE AN EMPLOYMENT FOR HIMSELF WHICH HADSEVERAL ATTRACTIONS
 I AM NOT SURE THAT CERTAIN FIBRES IN MR
 GARTHSMIND HAD NOT RESUMED THEIR OLD VIBRATION TOWARDS THE VERY END WHICH NOWREVEALED ITSELF TO FRED
 FOR THE EFFECTIVE ACCIDENT IS BUT THE TOUCH OFFIRE WHERE THERE IS OIL AND TOW AND IT ALWAYS APPEARED TO FRED THATTHE RAILWAY BROUGHT THE NEEDED TOUCH
 BUT THEY WENT ON IN SILENCEEXCEPT WHEN THEIR BUSINESS DEMANDED SPEECH
 AT LAST WHEN THEY HADFINISHED AND WERE WALKING AWAY MR
 GARTH SAIDA YOUNG FELLOW NEEDNT BE A B
 A
 TO DO THIS SORT OF WORK EH FRED
I WISH I HAD TAKEN TO IT BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF BEING A B
 A
 SAIDFRED
 HE PAUSED A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED MORE HESITATINGLY DO YOUTHINK I AM TOO OLD TO LEARN YOUR BUSINESS MR
 GARTH
MY BUSINESS IS OF MANY SORTS MY BOY SAID MR
 GARTH SMILING
 AGOOD DEAL OF WHAT I KNOW CAN ONLY COME FROM EXPERIENCE YOU CANT LEARNIT OFF AS YOU LEARN THINGS OUT OF A BOOK
 BUT YOU ARE YOUNG ENOUGH TOLAY A FOUNDATION YET
 CALEB PRONOUNCED THE LAST SENTENCE EMPHATICALLYBUT PAUSED IN SOME UNCERTAINTY
 HE HAD BEEN UNDER THE IMPRESSION LATELYTHAT FRED HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO ENTER THE CHURCH
YOU DO THINK I COULD DO SOME GOOD AT IT IF I WERE TO TRY
 SAID FREDMORE EAGERLY
THAT DEPENDS SAID CALEB TURNING HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND LOWERINGHIS VOICE WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO FELT HIMSELF TO BE SAYINGSOMETHING DEEPLY RELIGIOUS
 YOU MUST BE SURE OF TWO THINGS YOU MUSTLOVE YOUR WORK AND NOT BE ALWAYS LOOKING OVER THE EDGE OF IT WANTINGYOUR PLAY TO BEGIN
 AND THE OTHER IS YOU MUST NOT BE ASHAMED OF YOURWORK AND THINK IT WOULD BE MORE HONORABLE TO YOU TO BE DOING SOMETHINGELSE
 YOU MUST HAVE A PRIDE IN YOUR OWN WORK AND IN LEARNING TO DO ITWELL AND NOT BE ALWAYS SAYING THERES THIS AND THERES THATIF I HADTHIS OR THAT TO DO I MIGHT MAKE SOMETHING OF IT
 NO MATTER WHAT A MANISI WOULDNT GIVE TWOPENCE FOR HIMHERE CALEBS MOUTH LOOKED BITTERAND HE SNAPPED HIS FINGERSWHETHER HE WAS THE PRIME MINISTER OR THERICKTHATCHER IF HE DIDNT DO WELL WHAT HE UNDERTOOK TO DO
I CAN NEVER FEEL THAT I SHOULD DO THAT IN BEING A CLERGYMAN SAIDFRED MEANING TO TAKE A STEP IN ARGUMENT
THEN LET IT ALONE MY BOY SAID CALEB ABRUPTLY ELSE YOULL NEVERBE EASY
 OR IF YOU ARE EASY YOULL BE A POOR STICK
THAT IS VERY NEARLY WHAT MARY THINKS ABOUT IT SAID FRED COLORING
I THINK YOU MUST KNOW WHAT I FEEL FOR MARY MR
 GARTH I HOPE IT DOESNOT DISPLEASE YOU THAT I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED HER BETTER THAN ANY ONEELSE AND THAT I SHALL NEVER LOVE ANY ONE AS I LOVE HER
THE EXPRESSION OF CALEBS FACE WAS VISIBLY SOFTENING WHILE FRED SPOKE
BUT HE SWUNG HIS HEAD WITH A SOLEMN SLOWNESS AND SAIDTHAT MAKES THINGS MORE SERIOUS FRED IF YOU WANT TO TAKE MARYSHAPPINESS INTO YOUR KEEPING
I KNOW THAT MR
 GARTH SAID FRED EAGERLY AND I WOULD DO ANYTHINGFOR HER
 SHE SAYS SHE WILL NEVER HAVE ME IF I GO INTO THE CHURCH ANDI SHALL BE THE MOST MISERABLE DEVIL IN THE WORLD IF I LOSE ALL HOPE OFMARY
 REALLY IF I COULD GET SOME OTHER PROFESSION BUSINESSANYTHINGTHAT I AM AT ALL FIT FOR I WOULD WORK HARD I WOULD DESERVE YOUR GOODOPINION
 I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE TO DO WITH OUTDOOR THINGS
 I KNOW A GOODDEAL ABOUT LAND AND CATTLE ALREADY
 I USED TO BELIEVE YOU KNOWTHOUGHYOU WILL THINK ME RATHER FOOLISH FOR ITTHAT I SHOULD HAVE LAND OF MYOWN
 I AM SURE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT SORT WOULD COME EASILY TO MEESPECIALLY IF I COULD BE UNDER YOU IN ANY WAY
SOFTLY MY BOY SAID CALEB HAVING THE IMAGE OF SUSAN BEFORE HISEYES
 WHAT HAVE YOU SAID TO YOUR FATHER ABOUT ALL THIS
NOTHING YET BUT I MUST TELL HIM
 I AM ONLY WAITING TO KNOW WHAT ICAN DO INSTEAD OF ENTERING THE CHURCH
 I AM VERY SORRY TO DISAPPOINTHIM BUT A MAN OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED TO JUDGE FOR HIMSELF WHEN HE ISFOURANDTWENTY
 HOW COULD I KNOW WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN WHAT IT WOULD BERIGHT FOR ME TO DO NOW
 MY EDUCATION WAS A MISTAKE
BUT HEARKEN TO THIS FRED SAID CALEB
 ARE YOU SURE MARY IS FOND OFYOU OR WOULD EVER HAVE YOU
I ASKED MR
 FAREBROTHER TO TALK TO HER BECAUSE SHE HAD FORBIDDEN MEIDIDNT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO SAID FRED APOLOGETICALLY
 AND HE SAYSTHAT I HAVE EVERY REASON TO HOPE IF I CAN PUT MYSELF IN AN HONORABLEPOSITIONI MEAN OUT OF THE CHURCH
 I DARE SAY YOU THINK ITUNWARRANTABLE IN ME MR
 GARTH TO BE TROUBLING YOU AND OBTRUDING MYOWN WISHES ABOUT MARY BEFORE I HAVE DONE ANYTHING AT ALL FOR MYSELF
OF COURSE I HAVE NOT THE LEAST CLAIMINDEED I HAVE ALREADY A DEBT TOYOU WHICH WILL NEVER BE DISCHARGED EVEN WHEN I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PAYIT IN THE SHAPE OF MONEY
YES MY BOY YOU HAVE A CLAIM SAID CALEB WITH MUCH FEELING IN HISVOICE
 THE YOUNG ONES HAVE ALWAYS A CLAIM ON THE OLD TO HELP THEMFORWARD
 I WAS YOUNG MYSELF ONCE AND HAD TO DO WITHOUT MUCH HELP BUTHELP WOULD HAVE BEEN WELCOME TO ME IF IT HAD BEEN ONLY FOR THEFELLOWFEELINGS SAKE
 BUT I MUST CONSIDER
 COME TO ME TOMORROW AT THEOFFICE AT NINE OCLOCK
 AT THE OFFICE MIND
MR
 GARTH WOULD TAKE NO IMPORTANT STEP WITHOUT CONSULTING SUSAN BUT ITMUST BE CONFESSED THAT BEFORE HE REACHED HOME HE HAD TAKEN HISRESOLUTION
 WITH REGARD TO A LARGE NUMBER OF MATTERS ABOUT WHICH OTHERMEN ARE DECIDED OR OBSTINATE HE WAS THE MOST EASILY MANAGEABLE MAN INTHE WORLD
 HE NEVER KNEW WHAT MEAT HE WOULD CHOOSE AND IF SUSAN HADSAID THAT THEY OUGHT TO LIVE IN A FOURROOMED COTTAGE IN ORDER TOSAVE HE WOULD HAVE SAID LET US GO WITHOUT INQUIRING INTO DETAILS
BUT WHERE CALEBS FEELING AND JUDGMENT STRONGLY PRONOUNCED HE WAS ARULER AND IN SPITE OF HIS MILDNESS AND TIMIDITY IN REPROVING EVERYONE ABOUT HIM KNEW THAT ON THE EXCEPTIONAL OCCASIONS WHEN HE CHOSE HEWAS ABSOLUTE
 HE NEVER INDEED CHOSE TO BE ABSOLUTE EXCEPT ON SOME ONEELSES BEHALF
 ON NINETYNINE POINTS MRS
 GARTH DECIDED BUT ON THEHUNDREDTH SHE WAS OFTEN AWARE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO PERFORM THESINGULARLY DIFFICULT TASK OF CARRYING OUT HER OWN PRINCIPLE AND TOMAKE HERSELF SUBORDINATE
IT IS COME ROUND AS I THOUGHT SUSAN SAID CALEB WHEN THEY WERESEATED ALONE IN THE EVENING
 HE HAD ALREADY NARRATED THE ADVENTUREWHICH HAD BROUGHT ABOUT FREDS SHARING IN HIS WORK BUT HAD KEPT BACKTHE FURTHER RESULT
 THE CHILDREN ARE FOND OF EACH OTHERI MEAN FREDAND MARY
MRS
 GARTH LAID HER WORK ON HER KNEE AND FIXED HER PENETRATING EYESANXIOUSLY ON HER HUSBAND
AFTER WED DONE OUR WORK FRED POURED IT ALL OUT TO ME
 HE CANT BEARTO BE A CLERGYMAN AND MARY SAYS SHE WONT HAVE HIM IF HE IS ONE ANDTHE LAD WOULD LIKE TO BE UNDER ME AND GIVE HIS MIND TO BUSINESS
 ANDIVE DETERMINED TO TAKE HIM AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
CALEB
 SAID MRS
 GARTH IN A DEEP CONTRALTO EXPRESSIVE OF RESIGNEDASTONISHMENT
ITS A FINE THING TO DO SAID MR
 GARTH SETTLING HIMSELF FIRMLYAGAINST THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR AND GRASPING THE ELBOWS
 I SHALL HAVETROUBLE WITH HIM BUT I THINK I SHALL CARRY IT THROUGH
 THE LAD LOVESMARY AND A TRUE LOVE FOR A GOOD WOMAN IS A GREAT THING SUSAN
 ITSHAPES MANY A ROUGH FELLOW
HAS MARY SPOKEN TO YOU ON THE SUBJECT
 SAID MRS GARTH SECRETLY ALITTLE HURT THAT SHE HAD TO BE INFORMED ON IT HERSELF
NOT A WORD
 I ASKED HER ABOUT FRED ONCE I GAVE HER A BIT OF AWARNING
 BUT SHE ASSURED ME SHE WOULD NEVER MARRY AN IDLESELFINDULGENT MANNOTHING SINCE
 BUT IT SEEMS FRED SET ON MR
FAREBROTHER TO TALK TO HER BECAUSE SHE HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO SPEAKHIMSELF AND MR
 FAREBROTHER HAS FOUND OUT THAT SHE IS FOND OF FREDBUT SAYS HE MUST NOT BE A CLERGYMAN
 FREDS HEART IS FIXED ON MARYTHAT I CAN SEE IT GIVES ME A GOOD OPINION OF THE LADAND WE ALWAYSLIKED HIM SUSAN
IT IS A PITY FOR MARY I THINK SAID MRS
 GARTH
WHYA PITY
BECAUSE CALEB SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD A MAN WHO IS WORTH TWENTY FREDVINCYS
AH
 SAID CALEB WITH SURPRISE
I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT MR
 FAREBROTHER IS ATTACHED TO HER AND MEANT TOMAKE HER AN OFFER BUT OF COURSE NOW THAT FRED HAS USED HIM AS ANENVOY THERE IS AN END TO THAT BETTER PROSPECT
 THERE WAS A SEVEREPRECISION IN MRS
 GARTHS UTTERANCE
 SHE WAS VEXED AND DISAPPOINTEDBUT SHE WAS BENT ON ABSTAINING FROM USELESS WORDS
CALEB WAS SILENT A FEW MOMENTS UNDER A CONFLICT OF FEELINGS
 HE LOOKEDAT THE FLOOR AND MOVED HIS HEAD AND HANDS IN ACCOMPANIMENT TO SOMEINWARD ARGUMENTATION
 AT LAST HE SAIDTHAT WOULD HAVE MADE ME VERY PROUD AND HAPPY SUSAN AND I SHOULD HAVEBEEN GLAD FOR YOUR SAKE
 IVE ALWAYS FELT THAT YOUR BELONGINGS HAVENEVER BEEN ON A LEVEL WITH YOU
 BUT YOU TOOK ME THOUGH I WAS A PLAINMAN
I TOOK THE BEST AND CLEVEREST MAN I HAD EVER KNOWN SAID MRS
 GARTHCONVINCED THAT SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE LOVED ANY ONE WHO CAME SHORT OFTHAT MARK
WELL PERHAPS OTHERS THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER
 BUT IT WOULDHAVE BEEN WORSE FOR ME
 AND THAT IS WHAT TOUCHES ME CLOSE ABOUT FRED
THE LAD IS GOOD AT BOTTOM AND CLEVER ENOUGH TO DO IF HES PUT IN THERIGHT WAY AND HE LOVES AND HONORS MY DAUGHTER BEYOND ANYTHING AND SHEHAS GIVEN HIM A SORT OF PROMISE ACCORDING TO WHAT HE TURNS OUT
 I SAYTHAT YOUNG MANS SOUL IS IN MY HAND AND ILL DO THE BEST I CAN FORHIM SO HELP ME GOD
 ITS MY DUTY SUSAN
MRS
 GARTH WAS NOT GIVEN TO TEARS BUT THERE WAS A LARGE ONE ROLLINGDOWN HER FACE BEFORE HER HUSBAND HAD FINISHED
 IT CAME FROM THEPRESSURE OF VARIOUS FEELINGS IN WHICH THERE WAS MUCH AFFECTION ANDSOME VEXATION
 SHE WIPED IT AWAY QUICKLY SAYINGFEW MEN BESIDES YOU WOULD THINK IT A DUTY TO ADD TO THEIR ANXIETIES INTHAT WAY CALEB
THAT SIGNIFIES NOTHINGWHAT OTHER MEN WOULD THINK
 IVE GOT A CLEARFEELING INSIDE ME AND THAT I SHALL FOLLOW AND I HOPE YOUR HEART WILLGO WITH ME SUSAN IN MAKING EVERYTHING AS LIGHT AS CAN BE TO MARYPOOR CHILD
CALEB LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR LOOKED WITH ANXIOUS APPEAL TOWARDSHIS WIFE
 SHE ROSE AND KISSED HIM SAYING GOD BLESS YOU CALEB
 OURCHILDREN HAVE A GOOD FATHER
BUT SHE WENT OUT AND HAD A HEARTY CRY TO MAKE UP FOR THE SUPPRESSION OFHER WORDS
 SHE FELT SURE THAT HER HUSBANDS CONDUCT WOULD BEMISUNDERSTOOD AND ABOUT FRED SHE WAS RATIONAL AND UNHOPEFUL
 WHICHWOULD TURN OUT TO HAVE THE MORE FORESIGHT IN ITHER RATIONALITY ORCALEBS ARDENT GENEROSITY
WHEN FRED WENT TO THE OFFICE THE NEXT MORNING THERE WAS A TEST TO BEGONE THROUGH WHICH HE WAS NOT PREPARED FOR
NOW FRED SAID CALEB YOU WILL HAVE SOME DESKWORK
 I HAVE ALWAYSDONE A GOOD DEAL OF WRITING MYSELF BUT I CANT DO WITHOUT HELP AND ASI WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE ACCOUNTS AND GET THE VALUES INTO YOURHEAD I MEAN TO DO WITHOUT ANOTHER CLERK
 SO YOU MUST BUCKLE TO
 HOWARE YOU AT WRITING AND ARITHMETIC
FRED FELT AN AWKWARD MOVEMENT OF THE HEART HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OFDESKWORK BUT HE WAS IN A RESOLUTE MOOD AND NOT GOING TO SHRINK
 IMNOT AFRAID OF ARITHMETIC MR
 GARTH IT ALWAYS CAME EASILY TO ME
 ITHINK YOU KNOW MY WRITING
LET US SEE SAID CALEB TAKING UP A PEN EXAMINING IT CAREFULLY ANDHANDING IT WELL DIPPED TO FRED WITH A SHEET OF RULED PAPER
 COPY MEA LINE OR TWO OF THAT VALUATION WITH THE FIGURES AT THE END
AT THAT TIME THE OPINION EXISTED THAT IT WAS BENEATH A GENTLEMAN TOWRITE LEGIBLY OR WITH A HAND IN THE LEAST SUITABLE TO A CLERK
 FREDWROTE THE LINES DEMANDED IN A HAND AS GENTLEMANLY AS THAT OF ANYVISCOUNT OR BISHOP OF THE DAY THE VOWELS WERE ALL ALIKE AND THECONSONANTS ONLY DISTINGUISHABLE AS TURNING UP OR DOWN THE STROKES HADA BLOTTED SOLIDITY AND THE LETTERS DISDAINED TO KEEP THE LINEIN SHORTIT WAS A MANUSCRIPT OF THAT VENERABLE KIND EASY TO INTERPRET WHEN YOUKNOW BEFOREHAND WHAT THE WRITER MEANS
AS CALEB LOOKED ON HIS VISAGE SHOWED A GROWING DEPRESSION BUT WHENFRED HANDED HIM THE PAPER HE GAVE SOMETHING LIKE A SNARL AND RAPPEDTHE PAPER PASSIONATELY WITH THE BACK OF HIS HAND
 BAD WORK LIKE THISDISPELLED ALL CALEBS MILDNESS
THE DEUCE
 HE EXCLAIMED SNARLINGLY
 TO THINK THAT THIS IS A COUNTRYWHERE A MANS EDUCATION MAY COST HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND IT TURNSYOU OUT THIS
 THEN IN A MORE PATHETIC TONE PUSHING UP HIS SPECTACLESAND LOOKING AT THE UNFORTUNATE SCRIBE THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON USFRED I CANT PUT UP WITH THIS
WHAT CAN I DO MR
 GARTH
 SAID FRED WHOSE SPIRITS HAD SUNK VERY LOWNOT ONLY AT THE ESTIMATE OF HIS HANDWRITING BUT AT THE VISION OFHIMSELF AS LIABLE TO BE RANKED WITH OFFICE CLERKS
DO
 WHY YOU MUST LEARN TO FORM YOUR LETTERS AND KEEP THE LINE
 WHATSTHE USE OF WRITING AT ALL IF NOBODY CAN UNDERSTAND IT
 ASKED CALEBENERGETICALLY QUITE PREOCCUPIED WITH THE BAD QUALITY OF THE WORK
 ISTHERE SO LITTLE BUSINESS IN THE WORLD THAT YOU MUST BE SENDING PUZZLESOVER THE COUNTRY
 BUT THATS THE WAY PEOPLE ARE BROUGHT UP
 I SHOULDLOSE NO END OF TIME WITH THE LETTERS SOME PEOPLE SEND ME IF SUSAN DIDNOT MAKE THEM OUT FOR ME
 ITS DISGUSTING
 HERE CALEB TOSSED THE PAPERFROM HIM
ANY STRANGER PEEPING INTO THE OFFICE AT THAT MOMENT MIGHT HAVE WONDEREDWHAT WAS THE DRAMA BETWEEN THE INDIGNANT MAN OF BUSINESS AND THEFINELOOKING YOUNG FELLOW WHOSE BLOND COMPLEXION WAS GETTING RATHERPATCHY AS HE BIT HIS LIP WITH MORTIFICATION
 FRED WAS STRUGGLING WITHMANY THOUGHTS
 MR
 GARTH HAD BEEN SO KIND AND ENCOURAGING AT THEBEGINNING OF THEIR INTERVIEW THAT GRATITUDE AND HOPEFULNESS HAD BEENAT A HIGH PITCH AND THE DOWNFALL WAS PROPORTIONATE
 HE HAD NOT THOUGHTOF DESKWORKIN FACT LIKE THE MAJORITY OF YOUNG GENTLEMEN HE WANTEDAN OCCUPATION WHICH SHOULD BE FREE FROM DISAGREEABLES
 I CANNOT TELLWHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CONSEQUENCES IF HE HAD NOT DISTINCTLY PROMISEDHIMSELF THAT HE WOULD GO TO LOWICK TO SEE MARY AND TELL HER THAT HE WASENGAGED TO WORK UNDER HER FATHER
 HE DID NOT LIKE TO DISAPPOINT HIMSELFTHERE
I AM VERY SORRY WERE ALL THE WORDS THAT HE COULD MUSTER
 BUT MR
GARTH WAS ALREADY RELENTING
WE MUST MAKE THE BEST OF IT FRED HE BEGAN WITH A RETURN TO HISUSUAL QUIET TONE
 EVERY MAN CAN LEARN TO WRITE
 I TAUGHT MYSELF
 GO ATIT WITH A WILL AND SIT UP AT NIGHT IF THE DAYTIME ISNT ENOUGH
 WELLBE PATIENT MY BOY
 CALLUM SHALL GO ON WITH THE BOOKS FOR A BIT WHILEYOU ARE LEARNING
 BUT NOW I MUST BE OFF SAID CALEB RISING
 YOU MUSTLET YOUR FATHER KNOW OUR AGREEMENT
 YOULL SAVE ME CALLUMS SALARY YOUKNOW WHEN YOU CAN WRITE AND I CAN AFFORD TO GIVE YOU EIGHTY POUNDSFOR THE FIRST YEAR AND MORE AFTER
WHEN FRED MADE THE NECESSARY DISCLOSURE TO HIS PARENTS THE RELATIVEEFFECT ON THE TWO WAS A SURPRISE WHICH ENTERED VERY DEEPLY INTO HISMEMORY
 HE WENT STRAIGHT FROM MR
 GARTHS OFFICE TO THE WAREHOUSERIGHTLY FEELING THAT THE MOST RESPECTFUL WAY IN WHICH HE COULD BEHAVETO HIS FATHER WAS TO MAKE THE PAINFUL COMMUNICATION AS GRAVELY ANDFORMALLY AS POSSIBLE
 MOREOVER THE DECISION WOULD BE MORE CERTAINLYUNDERSTOOD TO BE FINAL IF THE INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE IN HIS FATHERSGRAVEST HOURS WHICH WERE ALWAYS THOSE SPENT IN HIS PRIVATE ROOM AT THEWAREHOUSE
FRED ENTERED ON THE SUBJECT DIRECTLY AND DECLARED BRIEFLY WHAT HE HADDONE AND WAS RESOLVED TO DO EXPRESSING AT THE END HIS REGRET THAT HESHOULD BE THE CAUSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT TO HIS FATHER AND TAKING THEBLAME ON HIS OWN DEFICIENCIES
 THE REGRET WAS GENUINE AND INSPIREDFRED WITH STRONG SIMPLE WORDS
MR
 VINCY LISTENED IN PROFOUND SURPRISE WITHOUT UTTERING EVEN ANEXCLAMATION A SILENCE WHICH IN HIS IMPATIENT TEMPERAMENT WAS A SIGN OFUNUSUAL EMOTION
 HE HAD NOT BEEN IN GOOD SPIRITS ABOUT TRADE THATMORNING AND THE SLIGHT BITTERNESS IN HIS LIPS GREW INTENSE AS HELISTENED
 WHEN FRED HAD ENDED THERE WAS A PAUSE OF NEARLY A MINUTEDURING WHICH MR
 VINCY REPLACED A BOOK IN HIS DESK AND TURNED THE KEYEMPHATICALLY
 THEN HE LOOKED AT HIS SON STEADILY AND SAIDSO YOUVE MADE UP YOUR MIND AT LAST SIR
YES FATHER
VERY WELL STICK TO IT
 IVE NO MORE TO SAY
 YOUVE THROWN AWAY YOUREDUCATION AND GONE DOWN A STEP IN LIFE WHEN I HAD GIVEN YOU THE MEANSOF RISING THATS ALL
I AM VERY SORRY THAT WE DIFFER FATHER
 I THINK I CAN BE QUITE AS MUCHOF A GENTLEMAN AT THE WORK I HAVE UNDERTAKEN AS IF I HAD BEEN ACURATE
 BUT I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR WISHING TO DO THE BEST FOR ME
VERY WELL I HAVE NO MORE TO SAY
 I WASH MY HANDS OF YOU
 I ONLY HOPEWHEN YOU HAVE A SON OF YOUR OWN HE WILL MAKE A BETTER RETURN FOR THEPAINS YOU SPEND ON HIM
THIS WAS VERY CUTTING TO FRED
 HIS FATHER WAS USING THAT UNFAIRADVANTAGE POSSESSED BY US ALL WHEN WE ARE IN A PATHETIC SITUATION ANDSEE OUR OWN PAST AS IF IT WERE SIMPLY PART OF THE PATHOS
 IN REALITYMR
 VINCYS WISHES ABOUT HIS SON HAD HAD A GREAT DEAL OF PRIDEINCONSIDERATENESS AND EGOISTIC FOLLY IN THEM
 BUT STILL THEDISAPPOINTED FATHER HELD A STRONG LEVER AND FRED FELT AS IF HE WEREBEING BANISHED WITH A MALEDICTION
I HOPE YOU WILL NOT OBJECT TO MY REMAINING AT HOME SIR
 HE SAIDAFTER RISING TO GO I SHALL HAVE A SUFFICIENT SALARY TO PAY FOR MYBOARD AS OF COURSE I SHOULD WISH TO DO
BOARD BE HANGED
 SAID MR
 VINCY RECOVERING HIMSELF IN HIS DISGUST ATTHE NOTION THAT FREDS KEEP WOULD BE MISSED AT HIS TABLE
 OF COURSEYOUR MOTHER WILL WANT YOU TO STAY
 BUT I SHALL KEEP NO HORSE FOR YOUYOU UNDERSTAND AND YOU WILL PAY YOUR OWN TAILOR
 YOU WILL DO WITH ASUIT OR TWO LESS I FANCY WHEN YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR EM
FRED LINGERED THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING TO BE SAID
 AT LAST IT CAME
I HOPE YOU WILL SHAKE HANDS WITH ME FATHER AND FORGIVE ME THEVEXATION I HAVE CAUSED YOU
MR
 VINCY FROM HIS CHAIR THREW A QUICK GLANCE UPWARD AT HIS SON WHOHAD ADVANCED NEAR TO HIM AND THEN GAVE HIS HAND SAYING HURRIEDLYYES YES LET US SAY NO MORE
FRED WENT THROUGH MUCH MORE NARRATIVE AND EXPLANATION WITH HIS MOTHERBUT SHE WAS INCONSOLABLE HAVING BEFORE HER EYES WHAT PERHAPS HERHUSBAND HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF THE CERTAINTY THAT FRED WOULD MARRY MARYGARTH THAT HER LIFE WOULD HENCEFORTH BE SPOILED BY A PERPETUALINFUSION OF GARTHS AND THEIR WAYS AND THAT HER DARLING BOY WITH HISBEAUTIFUL FACE AND STYLISH AIR BEYOND ANYBODY ELSES SON INMIDDLEMARCH WOULD BE SURE TO GET LIKE THAT FAMILY IN PLAINNESS OFAPPEARANCE AND CARELESSNESS ABOUT HIS CLOTHES
 TO HER IT SEEMED THATTHERE WAS A GARTH CONSPIRACY TO GET POSSESSION OF THE DESIRABLE FREDBUT SHE DARED NOT ENLARGE ON THIS OPINION BECAUSE A SLIGHT HINT OF ITHAD MADE HIM FLY OUT AT HER AS HE HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE
 HER TEMPERWAS TOO SWEET FOR HER TO SHOW ANY ANGER BUT SHE FELT THAT HERHAPPINESS HAD RECEIVED A BRUISE AND FOR SEVERAL DAYS MERELY TO LOOK ATFRED MADE HER CRY A LITTLE AS IF HE WERE THE SUBJECT OF SOME BALEFULPROPHECY
 PERHAPS SHE WAS THE SLOWER TO RECOVER HER USUAL CHEERFULNESSBECAUSE FRED HAD WARNED HER THAT SHE MUST NOT REOPEN THE SORE QUESTIONWITH HIS FATHER WHO HAD ACCEPTED HIS DECISION AND FORGIVEN HIM
 IF HERHUSBAND HAD BEEN VEHEMENT AGAINST FRED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN URGED INTODEFENCE OF HER DARLING
 IT WAS THE END OF THE FOURTH DAY WHEN MR
 VINCYSAID TO HERCOME LUCY MY DEAR DONT BE SO DOWNHEARTED
 YOU ALWAYS HAVE SPOILEDTHE BOY AND YOU MUST GO ON SPOILING HIM
NOTHING EVER DID CUT ME SO BEFORE VINCY SAID THE WIFE HER FAIRTHROAT AND CHIN BEGINNING TO TREMBLE AGAIN ONLY HIS ILLNESS
POOH POOH NEVER MIND
 WE MUST EXPECT TO HAVE TROUBLE WITH OURCHILDREN
 DONT MAKE IT WORSE BY LETTING ME SEE YOU OUT OF SPIRITS
WELL I WONT SAID MRS
 VINCY ROUSED BY THIS APPEAL AND ADJUSTINGHERSELF WITH A LITTLE SHAKE AS OF A BIRD WHICH LAYS DOWN ITS RUFFLEDPLUMAGE
IT WONT DO TO BEGIN MAKING A FUSS ABOUT ONE SAID MR
 VINCY WISHINGTO COMBINE A LITTLE GRUMBLING WITH DOMESTIC CHEERFULNESS
 THERESROSAMOND AS WELL AS FRED
YES POOR THING
 IM SURE I FELT FOR HER BEING DISAPPOINTED OF HERBABY BUT SHE GOT OVER IT NICELY
BABY POOH
 I CAN SEE LYDGATE IS MAKING A MESS OF HIS PRACTICE ANDGETTING INTO DEBT TOO BY WHAT I HEAR
 I SHALL HAVE ROSAMOND COMING TOME WITH A PRETTY TALE ONE OF THESE DAYS
 BUT THEYLL GET NO MONEY FROMME I KNOW
 LET HIS FAMILY HELP HIM
 I NEVER DID LIKE THAT MARRIAGE
BUT ITS NO USE TALKING
 RING THE BELL FOR LEMONS AND DONT LOOK DULLANY MORE LUCY
 ILL DRIVE YOU AND LOUISA TO RIVERSTON TOMORROW
CHAPTER LVII
THEY NUMBERED SCARCE EIGHT SUMMERS WHEN A NAME    ROSE ON THEIR SOULS AND STIRRED SUCH MOTIONS THEREAS THRILL THE BUDS AND SHAPE THEIR HIDDEN FRAME    AT PENETRATION OF THE QUICKENING AIRHIS NAME WHO TOLD OF LOYAL EVAN DHU    OF QUAINT BRADWARDINE AND VICH IAN VORMAKING THE LITTLE WORLD THEIR CHILDHOOD KNEW    LARGE WITH A LAND OF MOUNTAIN LAKE AND SCAURAND LARGER YET WITH WONDER LOVE BELIEF    TOWARD WALTER SCOTT WHO LIVING FAR AWAYSENT THEM THIS WEALTH OF JOY AND NOBLE GRIEF
    THE BOOK AND THEY MUST PART BUT DAY BY DAY        IN LINES THAT THWART LIKE PORTLY SPIDERS RAN        THEY WROTE THE TALE FROM TULLY VEOLAN
THE EVENING THAT FRED VINCY WALKED TO LOWICK PARSONAGE HE HAD BEGUN TOSEE THAT THIS WAS A WORLD IN WHICH EVEN A SPIRITED YOUNG MAN MUSTSOMETIMES WALK FOR WANT OF A HORSE TO CARRY HIM HE SET OUT AT FIVEOCLOCK AND CALLED ON MRS
 GARTH BY THE WAY WISHING TO ASSURE HIMSELFTHAT SHE ACCEPTED THEIR NEW RELATIONS WILLINGLY
HE FOUND THE FAMILY GROUP DOGS AND CATS INCLUDED UNDER THE GREATAPPLETREE IN THE ORCHARD
 IT WAS A FESTIVAL WITH MRS
 GARTH FOR HERELDEST SON CHRISTY HER PECULIAR JOY AND PRIDE HAD COME HOME FOR ASHORT HOLIDAYCHRISTY WHO HELD IT THE MOST DESIRABLE THING IN THEWORLD TO BE A TUTOR TO STUDY ALL LITERATURES AND BE A REGENERATEPORSON AND WHO WAS AN INCORPORATE CRITICISM ON POOR FRED A SORT OFOBJECTLESSON GIVEN TO HIM BY THE EDUCATIONAL MOTHER
 CHRISTY HIMSELFA SQUAREBROWED BROADSHOULDERED MASCULINE EDITION OF HIS MOTHER NOTMUCH HIGHER THAN FREDS SHOULDERWHICH MADE IT THE HARDER THAT HESHOULD BE HELD SUPERIORWAS ALWAYS AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE AND THOUGHTNO MORE OF FREDS DISINCLINATION TO SCHOLARSHIP THAN OF A GIRAFFESWISHING THAT HE HIMSELF WERE MORE OF THE SAME HEIGHT
 HE WAS LYING ONTHE GROUND NOW BY HIS MOTHERS CHAIR WITH HIS STRAW HAT LAID FLAT OVERHIS EYES WHILE JIM ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS READING ALOUD FROM THATBELOVED WRITER WHO HAS MADE A CHIEF PART IN THE HAPPINESS OF MANY YOUNGLIVES
 THE VOLUME WAS IVANHOE AND JIM WAS IN THE GREAT ARCHERY SCENEAT THE TOURNAMENT BUT SUFFERED MUCH INTERRUPTION FROM BEN WHO HADFETCHED HIS OWN OLD BOW AND ARROWS AND WAS MAKING HIMSELF DREADFULLYDISAGREEABLE LETTY THOUGHT BY BEGGING ALL PRESENT TO OBSERVE HISRANDOM SHOTS WHICH NO ONE WISHED TO DO EXCEPT BROWNIE THEACTIVEMINDED BUT PROBABLY SHALLOW MONGREL WHILE THE GRIZZLEDNEWFOUNDLAND LYING IN THE SUN LOOKED ON WITH THE DULLEYED NEUTRALITYOF EXTREME OLD AGE
 LETTY HERSELF SHOWING AS TO HER MOUTH AND PINAFORESOME SLIGHT SIGNS THAT SHE HAD BEEN ASSISTING AT THE GATHERING OF THECHERRIES WHICH STOOD IN A CORALHEAP ON THE TEATABLE WAS NOW SEATEDON THE GRASS LISTENING OPENEYED TO THE READING
BUT THE CENTRE OF INTEREST WAS CHANGED FOR ALL BY THE ARRIVAL OF FREDVINCY
 WHEN SEATING HIMSELF ON A GARDENSTOOL HE SAID THAT HE WAS ONHIS WAY TO LOWICK PARSONAGE BEN WHO HAD THROWN DOWN HIS BOW ANDSNATCHED UP A RELUCTANT HALFGROWN KITTEN INSTEAD STRODE ACROSS FREDSOUTSTRETCHED LEG AND SAID TAKE ME
OH AND ME TOO SAID LETTY
YOU CANT KEEP UP WITH FRED AND ME SAID BEN
YES I CAN
 MOTHER PLEASE SAY THAT I AM TO GO URGED LETTY WHOSELIFE WAS MUCH CHECKERED BY RESISTANCE TO HER DEPRECIATION AS A GIRL
I SHALL STAY WITH CHRISTY OBSERVED JIM AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT HEHAD THE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE SIMPLETONS WHEREUPON LETTY PUT HER HAND UPTO HER HEAD AND LOOKED WITH JEALOUS INDECISION FROM THE ONE TO THEOTHER
LET US ALL GO AND SEE MARY SAID CHRISTY OPENING HIS ARMS
NO MY DEAR CHILD WE MUST NOT GO IN A SWARM TO THE PARSONAGE
 ANDTHAT OLD GLASGOW SUIT OF YOURS WOULD NEVER DO
 BESIDES YOUR FATHERWILL COME HOME
 WE MUST LET FRED GO ALONE
 HE CAN TELL MARY THAT YOUARE HERE AND SHE WILL COME BACK TOMORROW
CHRISTY GLANCED AT HIS OWN THREADBARE KNEES AND THEN AT FREDSBEAUTIFUL WHITE TROUSERS
 CERTAINLY FREDS TAILORING SUGGESTED THEADVANTAGES OF AN ENGLISH UNIVERSITY AND HE HAD A GRACEFUL WAY EVEN OFLOOKING WARM AND OF PUSHING HIS HAIR BACK WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF
CHILDREN RUN AWAY SAID MRS
 GARTH IT IS TOO WARM TO HANG ABOUTYOUR FRIENDS
 TAKE YOUR BROTHER AND SHOW HIM THE RABBITS
THE ELDEST UNDERSTOOD AND LED OFF THE CHILDREN IMMEDIATELY
 FRED FELTTHAT MRS
 GARTH WISHED TO GIVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING ANYTHING HEHAD TO SAY BUT HE COULD ONLY BEGIN BY OBSERVINGHOW GLAD YOU MUST BE TO HAVE CHRISTY HERE
YES HE HAS COME SOONER THAN I EXPECTED
 HE GOT DOWN FROM THE COACH ATNINE OCLOCK JUST AFTER HIS FATHER WENT OUT
 I AM LONGING FOR CALEB TOCOME AND HEAR WHAT WONDERFUL PROGRESS CHRISTY IS MAKING
 HE HAS PAIDHIS EXPENSES FOR THE LAST YEAR BY GIVING LESSONS CARRYING ON HARDSTUDY AT THE SAME TIME
 HE HOPES SOON TO GET A PRIVATE TUTORSHIP AND GOABROAD
HE IS A GREAT FELLOW SAID FRED TO WHOM THESE CHEERFUL TRUTHS HAD AMEDICINAL TASTE AND NO TROUBLE TO ANYBODY
 AFTER A SLIGHT PAUSE HEADDED BUT I FEAR YOU WILL THINK THAT I AM GOING TO BE A GREAT DEAL OFTROUBLE TO MR
 GARTH
CALEB LIKES TAKING TROUBLE HE IS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO ALWAYS DO MORETHAN ANY ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF ASKING THEM TO DO ANSWERED MRS
GARTH
 SHE WAS KNITTING AND COULD EITHER LOOK AT FRED OR NOT AS SHECHOSEALWAYS AN ADVANTAGE WHEN ONE IS BENT ON LOADING SPEECH WITHSALUTARY MEANING AND THOUGH MRS
 GARTH INTENDED TO BE DULY RESERVEDSHE DID WISH TO SAY SOMETHING THAT FRED MIGHT BE THE BETTER FOR
I KNOW YOU THINK ME VERY UNDESERVING MRS
 GARTH AND WITH GOODREASON SAID FRED HIS SPIRIT RISING A LITTLE AT THE PERCEPTION OFSOMETHING LIKE A DISPOSITION TO LECTURE HIM
 I HAPPEN TO HAVE BEHAVEDJUST THE WORST TO THE PEOPLE I CANT HELP WISHING FOR THE MOST FROM
BUT WHILE TWO MEN LIKE MR
 GARTH AND MR
 FAREBROTHER HAVE NOT GIVEN MEUP I DONT SEE WHY I SHOULD GIVE MYSELF UP
 FRED THOUGHT IT MIGHT BEWELL TO SUGGEST THESE MASCULINE EXAMPLES TO MRS
 GARTH
ASSUREDLY SAID SHE WITH GATHERING EMPHASIS
 A YOUNG MAN FOR WHOMTWO SUCH ELDERS HAD DEVOTED THEMSELVES WOULD INDEED BE CULPABLE IF HETHREW HIMSELF AWAY AND MADE THEIR SACRIFICES VAIN
FRED WONDERED A LITTLE AT THIS STRONG LANGUAGE BUT ONLY SAID I HOPEIT WILL NOT BE SO WITH ME MRS
 GARTH SINCE I HAVE SOME ENCOURAGEMENTTO BELIEVE THAT I MAY WIN MARY
 MR
 GARTH HAS TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT
 YOUWERE NOT SURPRISED I DARE SAY
 FRED ENDED INNOCENTLY REFERRING ONLYTO HIS OWN LOVE AS PROBABLY EVIDENT ENOUGH
NOT SURPRISED THAT MARY HAS GIVEN YOU ENCOURAGEMENT
 RETURNED MRS
GARTH WHO THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR FRED TO BE MORE ALIVE TO THEFACT THAT MARYS FRIENDS COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE WISHED THISBEFOREHAND WHATEVER THE VINCYS MIGHT SUPPOSE
 YES I CONFESS I WASSURPRISED
SHE NEVER DID GIVE ME ANYNOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD WHEN I TALKED TOHER MYSELF SAID FRED EAGER TO VINDICATE MARY
 BUT WHEN I ASKED MR
FAREBROTHER TO SPEAK FOR ME SHE ALLOWED HIM TO TELL ME THERE WAS AHOPE
THE POWER OF ADMONITION WHICH HAD BEGUN TO STIR IN MRS
 GARTH HAD NOTYET DISCHARGED ITSELF
 IT WAS A LITTLE TOO PROVOKING EVEN FOR HERSELFCONTROL THAT THIS BLOOMING YOUNGSTER SHOULD FLOURISH ON THEDISAPPOINTMENTS OF SADDER AND WISER PEOPLEMAKING A MEAL OF ANIGHTINGALE AND NEVER KNOWING ITAND THAT ALL THE WHILE HIS FAMILYSHOULD SUPPOSE THAT HERS WAS IN EAGER NEED OF THIS SPRIG AND HERVEXATION HAD FERMENTED THE MORE ACTIVELY BECAUSE OF ITS TOTALREPRESSION TOWARDS HER HUSBAND
 EXEMPLARY WIVES WILL SOMETIMES FINDSCAPEGOATS IN THIS WAY
 SHE NOW SAID WITH ENERGETIC DECISION YOU MADEA GREAT MISTAKE FRED IN ASKING MR
 FAREBROTHER TO SPEAK FOR YOU
DID I
 SAID FRED REDDENING INSTANTANEOUSLY
 HE WAS ALARMED BUT AT ALOSS TO KNOW WHAT MRS
 GARTH MEANT AND ADDED IN AN APOLOGETIC TONEMR
 FAREBROTHER HAS ALWAYS BEEN SUCH A FRIEND OF OURS AND MARY IKNEW WOULD LISTEN TO HIM GRAVELY AND HE TOOK IT ON HIMSELF QUITEREADILY
YES YOUNG PEOPLE ARE USUALLY BLIND TO EVERYTHING BUT THEIR OWNWISHES AND SELDOM IMAGINE HOW MUCH THOSE WISHES COST OTHERS SAIDMRS
 GARTH
 SHE DID NOT MEAN TO GO BEYOND THIS SALUTARY GENERALDOCTRINE AND THREW HER INDIGNATION INTO A NEEDLESS UNWINDING OF HERWORSTED KNITTING HER BROW AT IT WITH A GRAND AIR
I CANNOT CONCEIVE HOW IT COULD BE ANY PAIN TO MR
 FAREBROTHER SAIDFRED WHO NEVERTHELESS FELT THAT SURPRISING CONCEPTIONS WERE BEGINNINGTO FORM THEMSELVES
PRECISELY YOU CANNOT CONCEIVE SAID MRS
 GARTH CUTTING HER WORDS ASNEATLY AS POSSIBLE
FOR A MOMENT FRED LOOKED AT THE HORIZON WITH A DISMAYED ANXIETY ANDTHEN TURNING WITH A QUICK MOVEMENT SAID ALMOST SHARPLYDO YOU MEAN TO SAY MRS
 GARTH THAT MR
 FAREBROTHER IS IN LOVE WITHMARY
AND IF IT WERE SO FRED I THINK YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON WHO OUGHT TOBE SURPRISED RETURNED MRS
 GARTH LAYING HER KNITTING DOWN BESIDE HERAND FOLDING HER ARMS
 IT WAS AN UNWONTED SIGN OF EMOTION IN HER THATSHE SHOULD PUT HER WORK OUT OF HER HANDS
 IN FACT HER FEELINGS WEREDIVIDED BETWEEN THE SATISFACTION OF GIVING FRED HIS DISCIPLINE AND THESENSE OF HAVING GONE A LITTLE TOO FAR
 FRED TOOK HIS HAT AND STICK ANDROSE QUICKLY
THEN YOU THINK I AM STANDING IN HIS WAY AND IN MARYS TOO
 HE SAIDIN A TONE WHICH SEEMED TO DEMAND AN ANSWER
MRS
 GARTH COULD NOT SPEAK IMMEDIATELY
 SHE HAD BROUGHT HERSELF INTOTHE UNPLEASANT POSITION OF BEING CALLED ON TO SAY WHAT SHE REALLY FELTYET WHAT SHE KNEW THERE WERE STRONG REASONS FOR CONCEALING
 AND TO HERTHE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING EXCEEDED IN WORDS WAS PECULIARLYMORTIFYING
 BESIDES FRED HAD GIVEN OUT UNEXPECTED ELECTRICITY AND HENOW ADDED MR
 GARTH SEEMED PLEASED THAT MARY SHOULD BE ATTACHED TOME
 HE COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN ANYTHING OF THIS
MRS
 GARTH FELT A SEVERE TWINGE AT THIS MENTION OF HER HUSBAND THEFEAR THAT CALEB MIGHT THINK HER IN THE WRONG NOT BEING EASILYENDURABLE
 SHE ANSWERED WANTING TO CHECK UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCESI SPOKE FROM INFERENCE ONLY
 I AM NOT AWARE THAT MARY KNOWS ANYTHINGOF THE MATTER
BUT SHE HESITATED TO BEG THAT HE WOULD KEEP ENTIRE SILENCE ON A SUBJECTWHICH SHE HAD HERSELF UNNECESSARILY MENTIONED NOT BEING USED TO STOOPIN THAT WAY AND WHILE SHE WAS HESITATING THERE WAS ALREADY A RUSH OFUNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES UNDER THE APPLETREE WHERE THE TEATHINGSSTOOD
 BEN BOUNCING ACROSS THE GRASS WITH BROWNIE AT HIS HEELS ANDSEEING THE KITTEN DRAGGING THE KNITTING BY A LENGTHENING LINE OF WOOLSHOUTED AND CLAPPED HIS HANDS BROWNIE BARKED THE KITTEN DESPERATEJUMPED ON THE TEATABLE AND UPSET THE MILK THEN JUMPED DOWN AGAIN ANDSWEPT HALF THE CHERRIES WITH IT AND BEN SNATCHING UP THE HALFKNITTEDSOCKTOP FITTED IT OVER THE KITTENS HEAD AS A NEW SOURCE OF MADNESSWHILE LETTY ARRIVING CRIED OUT TO HER MOTHER AGAINST THIS CRUELTYITWAS A HISTORY AS FULL OF SENSATION AS THIS IS THE HOUSE THAT JACKBUILT
 MRS
 GARTH WAS OBLIGED TO INTERFERE THE OTHER YOUNG ONES CAMEUP AND THE TÊTEÀTÊTE WITH FRED WAS ENDED
 HE GOT AWAY AS SOON AS HECOULD AND MRS
 GARTH COULD ONLY IMPLY SOME RETRACTATION OF HERSEVERITY BY SAYING GOD BLESS YOU WHEN SHE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM
SHE WAS UNPLEASANTLY CONSCIOUS THAT SHE HAD BEEN ON THE VERGE OFSPEAKING AS ONE OF THE FOOLISH WOMEN SPEAKETHTELLING FIRST ANDENTREATING SILENCE AFTER
 BUT SHE HAD NOT ENTREATED SILENCE AND TOPREVENT CALEBS BLAME SHE DETERMINED TO BLAME HERSELF AND CONFESS ALLTO HIM THAT VERY NIGHT
 IT WAS CURIOUS WHAT AN AWFUL TRIBUNAL THE MILDCALEBS WAS TO HER WHENEVER HE SET IT UP
 BUT SHE MEANT TO POINT OUTTO HIM THAT THE REVELATION MIGHT DO FRED VINCY A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD
NO DOUBT IT WAS HAVING A STRONG EFFECT ON HIM AS HE WALKED TO LOWICK
FREDS LIGHT HOPEFUL NATURE HAD PERHAPS NEVER HAD SO MUCH OF A BRUISEAS FROM THIS SUGGESTION THAT IF HE HAD BEEN OUT OF THE WAY MARY MIGHTHAVE MADE A THOROUGHLY GOOD MATCH
 ALSO HE WAS PIQUED THAT HE HAD BEENWHAT HE CALLED SUCH A STUPID LOUT AS TO ASK THAT INTERVENTION FROM MR
FAREBROTHER
 BUT IT WAS NOT IN A LOVERS NATUREIT WAS NOT IN FREDSTHAT THE NEW ANXIETY RAISED ABOUT MARYS FEELING SHOULD NOT SURMOUNTEVERY OTHER
 NOTWITHSTANDING HIS TRUST IN MR
 FAREBROTHERS GENEROSITYNOTWITHSTANDING WHAT MARY HAD SAID TO HIM FRED COULD NOT HELP FEELINGTHAT HE HAD A RIVAL IT WAS A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS AND HE OBJECTED TO ITEXTREMELY NOT BEING IN THE LEAST READY TO GIVE UP MARY FOR HER GOODBEING READY RATHER TO FIGHT FOR HER WITH ANY MAN WHATSOEVER
 BUT THEFIGHTING WITH MR
 FAREBROTHER MUST BE OF A METAPHORICAL KIND WHICH WASMUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO FRED THAN THE MUSCULAR
 CERTAINLY THISEXPERIENCE WAS A DISCIPLINE FOR FRED HARDLY LESS SHARP THAN HISDISAPPOINTMENT ABOUT HIS UNCLES WILL
 THE IRON HAD NOT ENTERED INTOHIS SOUL BUT HE HAD BEGUN TO IMAGINE WHAT THE SHARP EDGE WOULD BE
 ITDID NOT ONCE OCCUR TO FRED THAT MRS
 GARTH MIGHT BE MISTAKEN ABOUT MR
FAREBROTHER BUT HE SUSPECTED THAT SHE MIGHT BE WRONG ABOUT MARY
 MARYHAD BEEN STAYING AT THE PARSONAGE LATELY AND HER MOTHER MIGHT KNOWVERY LITTLE OF WHAT HAD BEEN PASSING IN HER MIND
HE DID NOT FEEL EASIER WHEN HE FOUND HER LOOKING CHEERFUL WITH THETHREE LADIES IN THE DRAWINGROOM
 THEY WERE IN ANIMATED DISCUSSION ONSOME SUBJECT WHICH WAS DROPPED WHEN HE ENTERED AND MARY WAS COPYINGTHE LABELS FROM A HEAP OF SHALLOW CABINET DRAWERS IN A MINUTEHANDWRITING WHICH SHE WAS SKILLED IN
 MR
 FAREBROTHER WAS SOMEWHERE INTHE VILLAGE AND THE THREE LADIES KNEW NOTHING OF FREDS PECULIARRELATION TO MARY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR EITHER OF THEM TO PROPOSE THATTHEY SHOULD WALK ROUND THE GARDEN AND FRED PREDICTED TO HIMSELF THATHE SHOULD HAVE TO GO AWAY WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO HER IN PRIVATE
 HETOLD HER FIRST OF CHRISTYS ARRIVAL AND THEN OF HIS OWN ENGAGEMENT WITHHER FATHER AND HE WAS COMFORTED BY SEEING THAT THIS LATTER NEWSTOUCHED HER KEENLY
 SHE SAID HURRIEDLY I AM SO GLAD AND THEN BENTOVER HER WRITING TO HINDER ANY ONE FROM NOTICING HER FACE
 BUT HERE WASA SUBJECT WHICH MRS
 FAREBROTHER COULD NOT LET PASS
YOU DONT MEAN MY DEAR MISS GARTH THAT YOU ARE GLAD TO HEAR OF AYOUNG MAN GIVING UP THE CHURCH FOR WHICH HE WAS EDUCATED YOU ONLY MEANTHAT THINGS BEING SO YOU ARE GLAD THAT HE SHOULD BE UNDER AN EXCELLENTMAN LIKE YOUR FATHER
NO REALLY MRS
 FAREBROTHER I AM GLAD OF BOTH I FEAR SAID MARYCLEVERLY GETTING RID OF ONE REBELLIOUS TEAR
 I HAVE A DREADFULLYSECULAR MIND
 I NEVER LIKED ANY CLERGYMAN EXCEPT THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELDAND MR
 FAREBROTHER
NOW WHY MY DEAR
 SAID MRS
 FAREBROTHER PAUSING ON HER LARGE WOODENKNITTINGNEEDLES AND LOOKING AT MARY
 YOU HAVE ALWAYS A GOOD REASONFOR YOUR OPINIONS BUT THIS ASTONISHES ME
 OF COURSE I PUT OUT OF THEQUESTION THOSE WHO PREACH NEW DOCTRINE
 BUT WHY SHOULD YOU DISLIKECLERGYMEN
OH DEAR SAID MARY HER FACE BREAKING INTO MERRIMENT AS SHE SEEMED TOCONSIDER A MOMENT I DONT LIKE THEIR NECKCLOTHS
WHY YOU DONT LIKE CAMDENS THEN SAID MISS WINIFRED IN SOMEANXIETY
YES I DO SAID MARY
 I DONT LIKE THE OTHER CLERGYMENS NECKCLOTHSBECAUSE IT IS THEY WHO WEAR THEM
HOW VERY PUZZLING
 SAID MISS NOBLE FEELING THAT HER OWN INTELLECTWAS PROBABLY DEFICIENT
MY DEAR YOU ARE JOKING
 YOU WOULD HAVE BETTER REASONS THAN THESE FORSLIGHTING SO RESPECTABLE A CLASS OF MEN SAID MRS
 FAREBROTHERMAJESTICALLY
MISS GARTH HAS SUCH SEVERE NOTIONS OF WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE THAT IT ISDIFFICULT TO SATISFY HER SAID FRED
WELL I AM GLAD AT LEAST THAT SHE MAKES AN EXCEPTION IN FAVOR OF MYSON SAID THE OLD LADY
MARY WAS WONDERING AT FREDS PIQUED TONE WHEN MR
 FAREBROTHER CAME INAND HAD TO HEAR THE NEWS ABOUT THE ENGAGEMENT UNDER MR
 GARTH
 AT THEEND HE SAID WITH QUIET SATISFACTION THAT IS RIGHT AND THEN BENTTO LOOK AT MARYS LABELS AND PRAISE HER HANDWRITING
 FRED FELT HORRIBLYJEALOUSWAS GLAD OF COURSE THAT MR
 FAREBROTHER WAS SO ESTIMABLE BUTWISHED THAT HE HAD BEEN UGLY AND FAT AS MEN AT FORTY SOMETIMES ARE
 ITWAS CLEAR WHAT THE END WOULD BE SINCE MARY OPENLY PLACED FAREBROTHERABOVE EVERYBODY AND THESE WOMEN WERE ALL EVIDENTLY ENCOURAGING THEAFFAIR
 HE WAS FEELING SURE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE NO CHANCE OF SPEAKINGTO MARY WHEN MR
 FAREBROTHER SAIDFRED HELP ME TO CARRY THESE DRAWERS BACK INTO MY STUDYYOU HAVE NEVERSEEN MY FINE NEW STUDY
 PRAY COME TOO MISS GARTH
 I WANT YOU TO SEE ASTUPENDOUS SPIDER I FOUND THIS MORNING
MARY AT ONCE SAW THE VICARS INTENTION
 HE HAD NEVER SINCE THEMEMORABLE EVENING DEVIATED FROM HIS OLD PASTORAL KINDNESS TOWARDS HERAND HER MOMENTARY WONDER AND DOUBT HAD QUITE GONE TO SLEEP
 MARY WASACCUSTOMED TO THINK RATHER RIGOROUSLY OF WHAT WAS PROBABLE AND IF ABELIEF FLATTERED HER VANITY SHE FELT WARNED TO DISMISS IT ASRIDICULOUS HAVING EARLY HAD MUCH EXERCISE IN SUCH DISMISSALS
 IT WASAS SHE HAD FORESEEN WHEN FRED HAD BEEN ASKED TO ADMIRE THE FITTINGS OFTHE STUDY AND SHE HAD BEEN ASKED TO ADMIRE THE SPIDER MR
 FAREBROTHERSAIDWAIT HERE A MINUTE OR TWO
 I AM GOING TO LOOK OUT AN ENGRAVING WHICHFRED IS TALL ENOUGH TO HANG FOR ME
 I SHALL BE BACK IN A FEW MINUTES
AND THEN HE WENT OUT
 NEVERTHELESS THE FIRST WORD FRED SAID TO MARYWASIT IS OF NO USE WHATEVER I DO MARY
 YOU ARE SURE TO MARRYFAREBROTHER AT LAST
 THERE WAS SOME RAGE IN HIS TONE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN FRED
 MARY EXCLAIMED INDIGNANTLY BLUSHING DEEPLYAND SURPRISED OUT OF ALL HER READINESS IN REPLY
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT SEE IT ALL CLEARLY ENOUGHYOU WHOSEE EVERYTHING
I ONLY SEE THAT YOU ARE BEHAVING VERY ILL FRED IN SPEAKING SO OF MR
FAREBROTHER AFTER HE HAS PLEADED YOUR CAUSE IN EVERY WAY
 HOW CAN YOUHAVE TAKEN UP SUCH AN IDEA
FRED WAS RATHER DEEP IN SPITE OF HIS IRRITATION
 IF MARY HAD REALLYBEEN UNSUSPICIOUS THERE WAS NO GOOD IN TELLING HER WHAT MRS
 GARTH HADSAID
IT FOLLOWS AS A MATTER OF COURSE HE REPLIED
 WHEN YOU ARECONTINUALLY SEEING A MAN WHO BEATS ME IN EVERYTHING AND WHOM YOU SETUP ABOVE EVERYBODY I CAN HAVE NO FAIR CHANCE
YOU ARE VERY UNGRATEFUL FRED SAID MARY
 I WISH I HAD NEVER TOLDMR
 FAREBROTHER THAT I CARED FOR YOU IN THE LEAST
NO I AM NOT UNGRATEFUL I SHOULD BE THE HAPPIEST FELLOW IN THE WORLDIF IT WERE NOT FOR THIS
 I TOLD YOUR FATHER EVERYTHING AND HE WAS VERYKIND HE TREATED ME AS IF I WERE HIS SON
 I COULD GO AT THE WORK WITH AWILL WRITING AND EVERYTHING IF IT WERE NOT FOR THIS
FOR THIS
 FOR WHAT
 SAID MARY IMAGINING NOW THAT SOMETHING SPECIFICMUST HAVE BEEN SAID OR DONE
THIS DREADFUL CERTAINTY THAT I SHALL BE BOWLED OUT BY FAREBROTHER
MARY WAS APPEASED BY HER INCLINATION TO LAUGH
FRED SHE SAID PEEPING ROUND TO CATCH HIS EYES WHICH WERE SULKILYTURNED AWAY FROM HER YOU ARE TOO DELIGHTFULLY RIDICULOUS
 IF YOU WERENOT SUCH A CHARMING SIMPLETON WHAT A TEMPTATION THIS WOULD BE TO PLAYTHE WICKED COQUETTE AND LET YOU SUPPOSE THAT SOMEBODY BESIDES YOU HASMADE LOVE TO ME
DO YOU REALLY LIKE ME BEST MARY
 SAID FRED TURNING EYES FULL OFAFFECTION ON HER AND TRYING TO TAKE HER HAND
I DONT LIKE YOU AT ALL AT THIS MOMENT SAID MARY RETREATING ANDPUTTING HER HANDS BEHIND HER
 I ONLY SAID THAT NO MORTAL EVER MADELOVE TO ME BESIDES YOU
 AND THAT IS NO ARGUMENT THAT A VERY WISE MANEVER WILL SHE ENDED MERRILY
I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME THAT YOU COULD NOT POSSIBLY EVER THINK OFHIM SAID FRED
NEVER DARE TO MENTION THIS ANY MORE TO ME FRED SAID MARY GETTINGSERIOUS AGAIN
 I DONT KNOW WHETHER IT IS MORE STUPID OR UNGENEROUS INYOU NOT TO SEE THAT MR
 FAREBROTHER HAS LEFT US TOGETHER ON PURPOSETHAT WE MIGHT SPEAK FREELY
 I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU SHOULD BE SOBLIND TO HIS DELICATE FEELING
THERE WAS NO TIME TO SAY ANY MORE BEFORE MR
 FAREBROTHER CAME BACK WITHTHE ENGRAVING AND FRED HAD TO RETURN TO THE DRAWINGROOM STILL WITH AJEALOUS DREAD IN HIS HEART BUT YET WITH COMFORTING ARGUMENTS FROMMARYS WORDS AND MANNER
 THE RESULT OF THE CONVERSATION WAS ON THEWHOLE MORE PAINFUL TO MARY INEVITABLY HER ATTENTION HAD TAKEN A NEWATTITUDE AND SHE SAW THE POSSIBILITY OF NEW INTERPRETATIONS
 SHE WASIN A POSITION IN WHICH SHE SEEMED TO HERSELF TO BE SLIGHTING MR
FAREBROTHER AND THIS IN RELATION TO A MAN WHO IS MUCH HONORED ISALWAYS DANGEROUS TO THE FIRMNESS OF A GRATEFUL WOMAN
 TO HAVE A REASONFOR GOING HOME THE NEXT DAY WAS A RELIEF FOR MARY EARNESTLY DESIRED TOBE ALWAYS CLEAR THAT SHE LOVED FRED BEST
 WHEN A TENDER AFFECTION HASBEEN STORING ITSELF IN US THROUGH MANY OF OUR YEARS THE IDEA THAT WECOULD ACCEPT ANY EXCHANGE FOR IT SEEMS TO BE A CHEAPENING OF OUR LIVES
AND WE CAN SET A WATCH OVER OUR AFFECTIONS AND OUR CONSTANCY AS WE CANOVER OTHER TREASURES
FRED HAS LOST ALL HIS OTHER EXPECTATIONS HE MUST KEEP THIS MARYSAID TO HERSELF WITH A SMILE CURLING HER LIPS
 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TOHELP FLEETING VISIONS OF ANOTHER KINDNEW DIGNITIES AND AN ACKNOWLEDGEDVALUE OF WHICH SHE HAD OFTEN FELT THE ABSENCE
 BUT THESE THINGS WITHFRED OUTSIDE THEM FRED FORSAKEN AND LOOKING SAD FOR THE WANT OF HERCOULD NEVER TEMPT HER DELIBERATE THOUGHT
CHAPTER LVIII
FOR THERE CAN LIVE NO HATRED IN THINE EYETHEREFORE IN THAT I CANNOT KNOW THY CHANGEIN MANYS LOOKS THE FALSE HEARTS HISTORYIS WRIT IN MOODS AND FROWNS AND WRINKLES STRANGEBUT HEAVEN IN THY CREATION DID DECREETHAT IN THY FACE SWEET LOVE SHOULD EVER DWELLWHATEER THY THOUGHTS OR THY HEARTS WORKINGS BETHY LOOKS SHOULD NOTHING THENCE BUT SWEETNESS TELL
SHAKESPEARE SONNETS
AT THE TIME WHEN MR
 VINCY UTTERED THAT PRESENTIMENT ABOUT ROSAMONDSHE HERSELF HAD NEVER HAD THE IDEA THAT SHE SHOULD BE DRIVEN TO MAKETHE SORT OF APPEAL WHICH HE FORESAW
 SHE HAD NOT YET HAD ANY ANXIETYABOUT WAYS AND MEANS ALTHOUGH HER DOMESTIC LIFE HAD BEEN EXPENSIVE ASWELL AS EVENTFUL
 HER BABY HAD BEEN BORN PREMATURELY AND ALL THEEMBROIDERED ROBES AND CAPS HAD TO BE LAID BY IN DARKNESS
 THISMISFORTUNE WAS ATTRIBUTED ENTIRELY TO HER HAVING PERSISTED IN GOING OUTON HORSEBACK ONE DAY WHEN HER HUSBAND HAD DESIRED HER NOT TO DO SO BUTIT MUST NOT BE SUPPOSED THAT SHE HAD SHOWN TEMPER ON THE OCCASION ORRUDELY TOLD HIM THAT SHE WOULD DO AS SHE LIKED
WHAT LED HER PARTICULARLY TO DESIRE HORSEEXERCISE WAS A VISIT FROMCAPTAIN LYDGATE THE BARONETS THIRD SON WHO I AM SORRY TO SAY WASDETESTED BY OUR TERTIUS OF THAT NAME AS A VAPID FOP PARTING HIS HAIRFROM BROW TO NAPE IN A DESPICABLE FASHION NOT FOLLOWED BY TERTIUSHIMSELF AND SHOWING AN IGNORANT SECURITY THAT HE KNEW THE PROPERTHING TO SAY ON EVERY TOPIC
 LYDGATE INWARDLY CURSED HIS OWN FOLLY THATHE HAD DRAWN DOWN THIS VISIT BY CONSENTING TO GO TO HIS UNCLES ON THEWEDDINGTOUR AND HE MADE HIMSELF RATHER DISAGREEABLE TO ROSAMOND BYSAYING SO IN PRIVATE
 FOR TO ROSAMOND THIS VISIT WAS A SOURCE OFUNPRECEDENTED BUT GRACEFULLY CONCEALED EXULTATION
 SHE WAS SO INTENSELYCONSCIOUS OF HAVING A COUSIN WHO WAS A BARONETS SON STAYING IN THEHOUSE THAT SHE IMAGINED THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WAS IMPLIED BY HISPRESENCE TO BE DIFFUSED THROUGH ALL OTHER MINDS AND WHEN SHEINTRODUCED CAPTAIN LYDGATE TO HER GUESTS SHE HAD A PLACID SENSE THATHIS RANK PENETRATED THEM AS IF IT HAD BEEN AN ODOR
 THE SATISFACTIONWAS ENOUGH FOR THE TIME TO MELT AWAY SOME DISAPPOINTMENT IN THECONDITIONS OF MARRIAGE WITH A MEDICAL MAN EVEN OF GOOD BIRTH IT SEEMEDNOW THAT HER MARRIAGE WAS VISIBLY AS WELL AS IDEALLY FLOATING HER ABOVETHE MIDDLEMARCH LEVEL AND THE FUTURE LOOKED BRIGHT WITH LETTERS ANDVISITS TO AND FROM QUALLINGHAM AND VAGUE ADVANCEMENT IN CONSEQUENCEFOR TERTIUS
 ESPECIALLY AS PROBABLY AT THE CAPTAINS SUGGESTION HISMARRIED SISTER MRS
 MENGAN HAD COME WITH HER MAID AND STAYED TWONIGHTS ON HER WAY FROM TOWN
 HENCE IT WAS CLEARLY WORTH WHILE FORROSAMOND TO TAKE PAINS WITH HER MUSIC AND THE CAREFUL SELECTION OF HERLACE
AS TO CAPTAIN LYDGATE HIMSELF HIS LOW BROW HIS AQUILINE NOSE BENT ONONE SIDE AND HIS RATHER HEAVY UTTERANCE MIGHT HAVE BEENDISADVANTAGEOUS IN ANY YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO HAD NOT A MILITARY BEARINGAND MUSTACHE TO GIVE HIM WHAT IS DOTED ON BY SOME FLOWERLIKE BLONDHEADS AS STYLE
 HE HAD MOREOVER THAT SORT OF HIGHBREEDING WHICHCONSISTS IN BEING FREE FROM THE PETTY SOLICITUDES OF MIDDLECLASSGENTILITY AND HE WAS A GREAT CRITIC OF FEMININE CHARMS
 ROSAMONDDELIGHTED IN HIS ADMIRATION NOW EVEN MORE THAN SHE HAD DONE ATQUALLINGHAM AND HE FOUND IT EASY TO SPEND SEVERAL HOURS OF THE DAY INFLIRTING WITH HER
 THE VISIT ALTOGETHER WAS ONE OF THE PLEASANTESTLARKS HE HAD EVER HAD NOT THE LESS SO PERHAPS BECAUSE HE SUSPECTEDTHAT HIS QUEER COUSIN TERTIUS WISHED HIM AWAY THOUGH LYDGATE WHOWOULD RATHER HYPERBOLICALLY SPEAKING HAVE DIED THAN HAVE FAILED INPOLITE HOSPITALITY SUPPRESSED HIS DISLIKE AND ONLY PRETENDEDGENERALLY NOT TO HEAR WHAT THE GALLANT OFFICER SAID CONSIGNING THETASK OF ANSWERING HIM TO ROSAMOND
 FOR HE WAS NOT AT ALL A JEALOUSHUSBAND AND PREFERRED LEAVING A FEATHERHEADED YOUNG GENTLEMAN ALONEWITH HIS WIFE TO BEARING HIM COMPANY
I WISH YOU WOULD TALK MORE TO THE CAPTAIN AT DINNER TERTIUS SAIDROSAMOND ONE EVENING WHEN THE IMPORTANT GUEST WAS GONE TO LOAMFORD TOSEE SOME BROTHER OFFICERS STATIONED THERE
 YOU REALLY LOOK SO ABSENTSOMETIMESYOU SEEM TO BE SEEING THROUGH HIS HEAD INTO SOMETHING BEHINDIT INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT HIM
MY DEAR ROSY YOU DONT EXPECT ME TO TALK MUCH TO SUCH A CONCEITED ASSAS THAT I HOPE SAID LYDGATE BRUSQUELY
 IF HE GOT HIS HEAD BROKENI MIGHT LOOK AT IT WITH INTEREST NOT BEFORE
I CANNOT CONCEIVE WHY YOU SHOULD SPEAK OF YOUR COUSIN SOCONTEMPTUOUSLY SAID ROSAMOND HER FINGERS MOVING AT HER WORK WHILESHE SPOKE WITH A MILD GRAVITY WHICH HAD A TOUCH OF DISDAIN IN IT
ASK LADISLAW IF HE DOESNT THINK YOUR CAPTAIN THE GREATEST BORE HEEVER MET WITH
 LADISLAW HAS ALMOST FORSAKEN THE HOUSE SINCE HE CAME
ROSAMOND THOUGHT SHE KNEW PERFECTLY WELL WHY MR
 LADISLAW DISLIKED THECAPTAIN HE WAS JEALOUS AND SHE LIKED HIS BEING JEALOUS
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WILL SUIT ECCENTRIC PERSONS SHEANSWERED BUT IN MY OPINION CAPTAIN LYDGATE IS A THOROUGH GENTLEMANAND I THINK YOU OUGHT NOT OUT OF RESPECT TO SIR GODWIN TO TREAT HIMWITH NEGLECT
NO DEAR BUT WE HAVE HAD DINNERS FOR HIM
 AND HE COMES IN AND GOESOUT AS HE LIKES
 HE DOESNT WANT ME
STILL WHEN HE IS IN THE ROOM YOU MIGHT SHOW HIM MORE ATTENTION
 HEMAY NOT BE A PHOENIX OF CLEVERNESS IN YOUR SENSE HIS PROFESSION ISDIFFERENT BUT IT WOULD BE ALL THE BETTER FOR YOU TO TALK A LITTLE ONHIS SUBJECTS
 I THINK HIS CONVERSATION IS QUITE AGREEABLE
 AND HE ISANYTHING BUT AN UNPRINCIPLED MAN
THE FACT IS YOU WOULD WISH ME TO BE A LITTLE MORE LIKE HIM ROSYSAID LYDGATE IN A SORT OF RESIGNED MURMUR WITH A SMILE WHICH WAS NOTEXACTLY TENDER AND CERTAINLY NOT MERRY
 ROSAMOND WAS SILENT AND DIDNOT SMILE AGAIN BUT THE LOVELY CURVES OF HER FACE LOOKED GOODTEMPEREDENOUGH WITHOUT SMILING
THOSE WORDS OF LYDGATES WERE LIKE A SAD MILESTONE MARKING HOW FAR HEHAD TRAVELLED FROM HIS OLD DREAMLAND IN WHICH ROSAMOND VINCY APPEAREDTO BE THAT PERFECT PIECE OF WOMANHOOD WHO WOULD REVERENCE HER HUSBANDSMIND AFTER THE FASHION OF AN ACCOMPLISHED MERMAID USING HER COMB ANDLOOKINGGLASS AND SINGING HER SONG FOR THE RELAXATION OF HIS ADOREDWISDOM ALONE
 HE HAD BEGUN TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THAT IMAGINEDADORATION AND THE ATTRACTION TOWARDS A MANS TALENT BECAUSE IT GIVESHIM PRESTIGE AND IS LIKE AN ORDER IN HIS BUTTONHOLE OR AN HONORABLEBEFORE HIS NAME
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED THAT ROSAMOND HAD TRAVELLED TOO SINCE SHEHAD FOUND THE POINTLESS CONVERSATION OF MR
 NED PLYMDALE PERFECTLYWEARISOME BUT TO MOST MORTALS THERE IS A STUPIDITY WHICH ISUNENDURABLE AND A STUPIDITY WHICH IS ALTOGETHER ACCEPTABLEELSEINDEED WHAT WOULD BECOME OF SOCIAL BONDS
 CAPTAIN LYDGATES STUPIDITYWAS DELICATELY SCENTED CARRIED ITSELF WITH STYLE TALKED WITH A GOODACCENT AND WAS CLOSELY RELATED TO SIR GODWIN
 ROSAMOND FOUND IT QUITEAGREEABLE AND CAUGHT MANY OF ITS PHRASES
THEREFORE SINCE ROSAMOND AS WE KNOW WAS FOND OF HORSEBACK THERE WEREPLENTY OF REASONS WHY SHE SHOULD BE TEMPTED TO RESUME HER RIDING WHENCAPTAIN LYDGATE WHO HAD ORDERED HIS MAN WITH TWO HORSES TO FOLLOW HIMAND PUT UP AT THE GREEN DRAGON BEGGED HER TO GO OUT ON THE GRAYWHICH HE WARRANTED TO BE GENTLE AND TRAINED TO CARRY A LADYINDEED HEHAD BOUGHT IT FOR HIS SISTER AND WAS TAKING IT TO QUALLINGHAM
ROSAMOND WENT OUT THE FIRST TIME WITHOUT TELLING HER HUSBAND AND CAMEBACK BEFORE HIS RETURN BUT THE RIDE HAD BEEN SO THOROUGH A SUCCESSAND SHE DECLARED HERSELF SO MUCH THE BETTER IN CONSEQUENCE THAT HE WASINFORMED OF IT WITH FULL RELIANCE ON HIS CONSENT THAT SHE SHOULD GORIDING AGAIN
ON THE CONTRARY LYDGATE WAS MORE THAN HURTHE WAS UTTERLY CONFOUNDEDTHAT SHE HAD RISKED HERSELF ON A STRANGE HORSE WITHOUT REFERRING THEMATTER TO HIS WISH
 AFTER THE FIRST ALMOST THUNDERING EXCLAMATIONS OFASTONISHMENT WHICH SUFFICIENTLY WARNED ROSAMOND OF WHAT WAS COMING HEWAS SILENT FOR SOME MOMENTS
HOWEVER YOU HAVE COME BACK SAFELY HE SAID AT LAST IN A DECISIVETONE
 YOU WILL NOT GO AGAIN ROSY THAT IS UNDERSTOOD
 IF IT WERE THEQUIETEST MOST FAMILIAR HORSE IN THE WORLD THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE THECHANCE OF ACCIDENT
 AND YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT I WISHED YOU TO GIVE UPRIDING THE ROAN ON THAT ACCOUNT
BUT THERE IS THE CHANCE OF ACCIDENT INDOORS TERTIUS
MY DARLING DONT TALK NONSENSE SAID LYDGATE IN AN IMPLORING TONESURELY I AM THE PERSON TO JUDGE FOR YOU
 I THINK IT IS ENOUGH THAT ISAY YOU ARE NOT TO GO AGAIN
ROSAMOND WAS ARRANGING HER HAIR BEFORE DINNER AND THE REFLECTION OFHER HEAD IN THE GLASS SHOWED NO CHANGE IN ITS LOVELINESS EXCEPT ALITTLE TURNING ASIDE OF THE LONG NECK
 LYDGATE HAD BEEN MOVING ABOUTWITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND NOW PAUSED NEAR HER AS IF HEAWAITED SOME ASSURANCE
I WISH YOU WOULD FASTEN UP MY PLAITS DEAR SAID ROSAMOND LETTINGHER ARMS FALL WITH A LITTLE SIGH SO AS TO MAKE A HUSBAND ASHAMED OFSTANDING THERE LIKE A BRUTE
 LYDGATE HAD OFTEN FASTENED THE PLAITSBEFORE BEING AMONG THE DEFTEST OF MEN WITH HIS LARGE FINELY FORMEDFINGERS
 HE SWEPT UP THE SOFT FESTOONS OF PLAITS AND FASTENED IN THETALL COMB TO SUCH USES DO MEN COME
 AND WHAT COULD HE DO THEN BUTKISS THE EXQUISITE NAPE WHICH WAS SHOWN IN ALL ITS DELICATE CURVES
 BUTWHEN WE DO WHAT WE HAVE DONE BEFORE IT IS OFTEN WITH A DIFFERENCE
LYDGATE WAS STILL ANGRY AND HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HIS POINT
I SHALL TELL THE CAPTAIN THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN OFFERYOU HIS HORSE HE SAID AS HE MOVED AWAY
I BEG YOU WILL NOT DO ANYTHING OF THE KIND TERTIUS SAID ROSAMONDLOOKING AT HIM WITH SOMETHING MORE MARKED THAN USUAL IN HER SPEECH
 ITWILL BE TREATING ME AS IF I WERE A CHILD
 PROMISE THAT YOU WILL LEAVETHE SUBJECT TO ME
THERE DID SEEM TO BE SOME TRUTH IN HER OBJECTION
 LYDGATE SAID VERYWELL WITH A SURLY OBEDIENCE AND THUS THE DISCUSSION ENDED WITH HISPROMISING ROSAMOND AND NOT WITH HER PROMISING HIM
IN FACT SHE HAD BEEN DETERMINED NOT TO PROMISE
 ROSAMOND HAD THATVICTORIOUS OBSTINACY WHICH NEVER WASTES ITS ENERGY IN IMPETUOUSRESISTANCE
 WHAT SHE LIKED TO DO WAS TO HER THE RIGHT THING AND ALLHER CLEVERNESS WAS DIRECTED TO GETTING THE MEANS OF DOING IT
 SHE MEANTTO GO OUT RIDING AGAIN ON THE GRAY AND SHE DID GO ON THE NEXTOPPORTUNITY OF HER HUSBANDS ABSENCE NOT INTENDING THAT HE SHOULD KNOWUNTIL IT WAS LATE ENOUGH NOT TO SIGNIFY TO HER
 THE TEMPTATION WASCERTAINLY GREAT SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE EXERCISE AND THEGRATIFICATION OF RIDING ON A FINE HORSE WITH CAPTAIN LYDGATE SIRGODWINS SON ON ANOTHER FINE HORSE BY HER SIDE AND OF BEING MET INTHIS POSITION BY ANY ONE BUT HER HUSBAND WAS SOMETHING AS GOOD AS HERDREAMS BEFORE MARRIAGE MOREOVER SHE WAS RIVETING THE CONNECTION WITHTHE FAMILY AT QUALLINGHAM WHICH MUST BE A WISE THING TO DO
BUT THE GENTLE GRAY UNPREPARED FOR THE CRASH OF A TREE THAT WAS BEINGFELLED ON THE EDGE OF HALSELL WOOD TOOK FRIGHT AND CAUSED A WORSEFRIGHT TO ROSAMOND LEADING FINALLY TO THE LOSS OF HER BABY
 LYDGATECOULD NOT SHOW HIS ANGER TOWARDS HER BUT HE WAS RATHER BEARISH TO THECAPTAIN WHOSE VISIT NATURALLY SOON CAME TO AN END
IN ALL FUTURE CONVERSATIONS ON THE SUBJECT ROSAMOND WAS MILDLY CERTAINTHAT THE RIDE HAD MADE NO DIFFERENCE AND THAT IF SHE HAD STAYED ATHOME THE SAME SYMPTOMS WOULD HAVE COME ON AND WOULD HAVE ENDED IN THESAME WAY BECAUSE SHE HAD FELT SOMETHING LIKE THEM BEFORE
LYDGATE COULD ONLY SAY POOR POOR DARLING
BUT HE SECRETLY WONDEREDOVER THE TERRIBLE TENACITY OF THIS MILD CREATURE
 THERE WAS GATHERINGWITHIN HIM AN AMAZED SENSE OF HIS POWERLESSNESS OVER ROSAMOND
 HISSUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE AND MENTAL FORCE INSTEAD OF BEING AS HE HADIMAGINED A SHRINE TO CONSULT ON ALL OCCASIONS WAS SIMPLY SET ASIDE ONEVERY PRACTICAL QUESTION
 HE HAD REGARDED ROSAMONDS CLEVERNESS ASPRECISELY OF THE RECEPTIVE KIND WHICH BECAME A WOMAN
 HE WAS NOWBEGINNING TO FIND OUT WHAT THAT CLEVERNESS WASWHAT WAS THE SHAPE INTOWHICH IT HAD RUN AS INTO A CLOSE NETWORK ALOOF AND INDEPENDENT
 NO ONEQUICKER THAN ROSAMOND TO SEE CAUSES AND EFFECTS WHICH LAY WITHIN THETRACK OF HER OWN TASTES AND INTERESTS SHE HAD SEEN CLEARLY LYDGATESPREEMINENCE IN MIDDLEMARCH SOCIETY AND COULD GO ON IMAGINATIVELYTRACING STILL MORE AGREEABLE SOCIAL EFFECTS WHEN HIS TALENT SHOULD HAVEADVANCED HIM BUT FOR HER HIS PROFESSIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC AMBITION HADNO OTHER RELATION TO THESE DESIRABLE EFFECTS THAN IF THEY HAD BEEN THEFORTUNATE DISCOVERY OF AN ILLSMELLING OIL
 AND THAT OIL APART WITHWHICH SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO OF COURSE SHE BELIEVED IN HER OWN OPINIONMORE THAN SHE DID IN HIS
 LYDGATE WAS ASTOUNDED TO FIND IN NUMBERLESSTRIFLING MATTERS AS WELL AS IN THIS LAST SERIOUS CASE OF THE RIDINGTHAT AFFECTION DID NOT MAKE HER COMPLIANT
 HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT THEAFFECTION WAS THERE AND HAD NO PRESENTIMENT THAT HE HAD DONE ANYTHINGTO REPEL IT
 FOR HIS OWN PART HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE LOVED HER ASTENDERLY AS EVER AND COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND TO HER NEGATIONSBUTWELL
 LYDGATE WAS MUCH WORRIED AND CONSCIOUS OF NEW ELEMENTS INHIS LIFE AS NOXIOUS TO HIM AS AN INLET OF MUD TO A CREATURE THAT HASBEEN USED TO BREATHE AND BATHE AND DART AFTER ITS ILLUMINATED PREY INTHE CLEAREST OF WATERS
ROSAMOND WAS SOON LOOKING LOVELIER THAN EVER AT HER WORKTABLE ENJOYINGDRIVES IN HER FATHERS PHAETON AND THINKING IT LIKELY THAT SHE MIGHT BEINVITED TO QUALLINGHAM
 SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS A MUCH MORE EXQUISITEORNAMENT TO THE DRAWINGROOM THERE THAN ANY DAUGHTER OF THE FAMILY ANDIN REFLECTING THAT THE GENTLEMEN WERE AWARE OF THAT DID NOT PERHAPSSUFFICIENTLY CONSIDER WHETHER THE LADIES WOULD BE EAGER TO SEETHEMSELVES SURPASSED
LYDGATE RELIEVED FROM ANXIETY ABOUT HER RELAPSED INTO WHAT SHEINWARDLY CALLED HIS MOODINESSA NAME WHICH TO HER COVERED HISTHOUGHTFUL PREOCCUPATION WITH OTHER SUBJECTS THAN HERSELF AS WELL ASTHAT UNEASY LOOK OF THE BROW AND DISTASTE FOR ALL ORDINARY THINGS AS IFTHEY WERE MIXED WITH BITTER HERBS WHICH REALLY MADE A SORT OFWEATHERGLASS TO HIS VEXATION AND FOREBODING
 THESE LATTER STATES OFMIND HAD ONE CAUSE AMONGST OTHERS WHICH HE HAD GENEROUSLY BUTMISTAKENLY AVOIDED MENTIONING TO ROSAMOND LEST IT SHOULD AFFECT HERHEALTH AND SPIRITS
 BETWEEN HIM AND HER INDEED THERE WAS THAT TOTALMISSING OF EACH OTHERS MENTAL TRACK WHICH IS TOO EVIDENTLY POSSIBLEEVEN BETWEEN PERSONS WHO ARE CONTINUALLY THINKING OF EACH OTHER
 TOLYDGATE IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD BEEN SPENDING MONTH AFTER MONTH INSACRIFICING MORE THAN HALF OF HIS BEST INTENT AND BEST POWER TO HISTENDERNESS FOR ROSAMOND BEARING HER LITTLE CLAIMS AND INTERRUPTIONSWITHOUT IMPATIENCE AND ABOVE ALL BEARING WITHOUT BETRAYAL OFBITTERNESS TO LOOK THROUGH LESS AND LESS OF INTERFERING ILLUSION AT THEBLANK UNREFLECTING SURFACE HER MIND PRESENTED TO HIS ARDOR FOR THE MOREIMPERSONAL ENDS OF HIS PROFESSION AND HIS SCIENTIFIC STUDY AN ARDORWHICH HE HAD FANCIED THAT THE IDEAL WIFE MUST SOMEHOW WORSHIP ASSUBLIME THOUGH NOT IN THE LEAST KNOWING WHY
 BUT HIS ENDURANCE WASMINGLED WITH A SELFDISCONTENT WHICH IF WE KNOW HOW TO BE CANDID WESHALL CONFESS TO MAKE MORE THAN HALF OUR BITTERNESS UNDER GRIEVANCESWIFE OR HUSBAND INCLUDED
 IT ALWAYS REMAINS TRUE THAT IF WE HAD BEENGREATER CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS STRONG AGAINST US
 LYDGATEWAS AWARE THAT HIS CONCESSIONS TO ROSAMOND WERE OFTEN LITTLE MORE THANTHE LAPSE OF SLACKENING RESOLUTION THE CREEPING PARALYSIS APT TO SEIZEAN ENTHUSIASM WHICH IS OUT OF ADJUSTMENT TO A CONSTANT PORTION OF OURLIVES
 AND ON LYDGATES ENTHUSIASM THERE WAS CONSTANTLY PRESSING NOT ASIMPLE WEIGHT OF SORROW BUT THE BITING PRESENCE OF A PETTY DEGRADINGCARE SUCH AS CASTS THE BLIGHT OF IRONY OVER ALL HIGHER EFFORT
THIS WAS THE CARE WHICH HE HAD HITHERTO ABSTAINED FROM MENTIONING TOROSAMOND AND HE BELIEVED WITH SOME WONDER THAT IT HAD NEVER ENTEREDHER MIND THOUGH CERTAINLY NO DIFFICULTY COULD BE LESS MYSTERIOUS
 ITWAS AN INFERENCE WITH A CONSPICUOUS HANDLE TO IT AND HAD BEEN EASILYDRAWN BY INDIFFERENT OBSERVERS THAT LYDGATE WAS IN DEBT AND HE COULDNOT SUCCEED IN KEEPING OUT OF HIS MIND FOR LONG TOGETHER THAT HE WASEVERY DAY GETTING DEEPER INTO THAT SWAMP WHICH TEMPTS MEN TOWARDS ITWITH SUCH A PRETTY COVERING OF FLOWERS AND VERDURE
 IT IS WONDERFUL HOWSOON A MAN GETS UP TO HIS CHIN THEREIN A CONDITION IN WHICH IN SPITEOF HIMSELF HE IS FORCED TO THINK CHIEFLY OF RELEASE THOUGH HE HAD ASCHEME OF THE UNIVERSE IN HIS SOUL
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO LYDGATE WAS POOR BUT HAD NEVER KNOWN THE EAGERWANT OF SMALL SUMS AND FELT RATHER A BURNING CONTEMPT FOR ANY ONE WHODESCENDED A STEP IN ORDER TO GAIN THEM
 HE WAS NOW EXPERIENCINGSOMETHING WORSE THAN A SIMPLE DEFICIT HE WAS ASSAILED BY THE VULGARHATEFUL TRIALS OF A MAN WHO HAS BOUGHT AND USED A GREAT MANY THINGSWHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE WITHOUT AND WHICH HE IS UNABLE TO PAY FORTHOUGH THE DEMAND FOR PAYMENT HAS BECOME PRESSING
HOW THIS CAME ABOUT MAY BE EASILY SEEN WITHOUT MUCH ARITHMETIC ORKNOWLEDGE OF PRICES
 WHEN A MAN IN SETTING UP A HOUSE AND PREPARING FORMARRIAGE FINDS THAT HIS FURNITURE AND OTHER INITIAL EXPENSES COME TOBETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS MORE THAN HE HAS CAPITAL TO PAYFOR WHEN AT THE END OF A YEAR IT APPEARS THAT HIS HOUSEHOLD EXPENSESHORSES AND ET CAETERAS AMOUNT TO NEARLY A THOUSAND WHILE THE PROCEEDSOF THE PRACTICE RECKONED FROM THE OLD BOOKS TO BE WORTH EIGHT HUNDREDPER ANNUM HAVE SUNK LIKE A SUMMER POND AND MAKE HARDLY FIVE HUNDREDCHIEFLY IN UNPAID ENTRIES THE PLAIN INFERENCE IS THAT WHETHER HEMINDS IT OR NOT HE IS IN DEBT
 THOSE WERE LESS EXPENSIVE TIMES THANOUR OWN AND PROVINCIAL LIFE WAS COMPARATIVELY MODEST BUT THE EASEWITH WHICH A MEDICAL MAN WHO HAD LATELY BOUGHT A PRACTICE WHO THOUGHTTHAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO KEEP TWO HORSES WHOSE TABLE WAS SUPPLIEDWITHOUT STINT AND WHO PAID AN INSURANCE ON HIS LIFE AND A HIGH RENTFOR HOUSE AND GARDEN MIGHT FIND HIS EXPENSES DOUBLING HIS RECEIPTSCAN BE CONCEIVED BY ANY ONE WHO DOES NOT THINK THESE DETAILS BENEATHHIS CONSIDERATION
 ROSAMOND ACCUSTOMED FROM HER CHILDHOOD TO ANEXTRAVAGANT HOUSEHOLD THOUGHT THAT GOOD HOUSEKEEPING CONSISTED SIMPLYIN ORDERING THE BEST OF EVERYTHINGNOTHING ELSE ANSWERED AND LYDGATESUPPOSED THAT IF THINGS WERE DONE AT ALL THEY MUST BE DONEPROPERLYHE DID NOT SEE HOW THEY WERE TO LIVE OTHERWISE
 IF EACH HEADOF HOUSEHOLD EXPENDITURE HAD BEEN MENTIONED TO HIM BEFOREHAND HE WOULDHAVE PROBABLY OBSERVED THAT IT COULD HARDLY COME TO MUCH AND IF ANYONE HAD SUGGESTED A SAVING ON A PARTICULAR ARTICLEFOR EXAMPLE THESUBSTITUTION OF CHEAP FISH FOR DEARIT WOULD HAVE APPEARED TO HIMSIMPLY A PENNYWISE MEAN NOTION
 ROSAMOND EVEN WITHOUT SUCH ANOCCASION AS CAPTAIN LYDGATES VISIT WAS FOND OF GIVING INVITATIONSAND LYDGATE THOUGH HE OFTEN THOUGHT THE GUESTS TIRESOME DID NOTINTERFERE
 THIS SOCIABILITY SEEMED A NECESSARY PART OF PROFESSIONALPRUDENCE AND THE ENTERTAINMENT MUST BE SUITABLE
 IT IS TRUE LYDGATEWAS CONSTANTLY VISITING THE HOMES OF THE POOR AND ADJUSTING HISPRESCRIPTIONS OF DIET TO THEIR SMALL MEANS BUT DEAR ME
 HAS IT NOT BYTHIS TIME CEASED TO BE REMARKABLEIS IT NOT RATHER THAT WE EXPECT INMEN THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE NUMEROUS STRANDS OF EXPERIENCE LYING SIDE BYSIDE AND NEVER COMPARE THEM WITH EACH OTHER
 EXPENDITURELIKE UGLINESSAND ERRORSBECOMES A TOTALLY NEW THING WHEN WE ATTACH OUR OWNPERSONALITY TO IT AND MEASURE IT BY THAT WIDE DIFFERENCE WHICH ISMANIFEST IN OUR OWN SENSATIONS BETWEEN OURSELVES AND OTHERS
 LYDGATEBELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE CARELESS ABOUT HIS DRESS AND HE DESPISED A MANWHO CALCULATED THE EFFECTS OF HIS COSTUME IT SEEMED TO HIM ONLY AMATTER OF COURSE THAT HE HAD ABUNDANCE OF FRESH GARMENTSSUCH THINGSWERE NATURALLY ORDERED IN SHEAVES
 IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT HE HADNEVER HITHERTO FELT THE CHECK OF IMPORTUNATE DEBT AND HE WALKED BYHABIT NOT BY SELFCRITICISM
 BUT THE CHECK HAD COME
ITS NOVELTY MADE IT THE MORE IRRITATING
 HE WAS AMAZED DISGUSTED THATCONDITIONS SO FOREIGN TO ALL HIS PURPOSES SO HATEFULLY DISCONNECTEDWITH THE OBJECTS HE CARED TO OCCUPY HIMSELF WITH SHOULD HAVE LAIN INAMBUSH AND CLUTCHED HIM WHEN HE WAS UNAWARE
 AND THERE WAS NOT ONLY THEACTUAL DEBT THERE WAS THE CERTAINTY THAT IN HIS PRESENT POSITION HEMUST GO ON DEEPENING IT
 TWO FURNISHING TRADESMEN AT BRASSING WHOSEBILLS HAD BEEN INCURRED BEFORE HIS MARRIAGE AND WHOM UNCALCULATEDCURRENT EXPENSES HAD EVER SINCE PREVENTED HIM FROM PAYING HADREPEATEDLY SENT HIM UNPLEASANT LETTERS WHICH HAD FORCED THEMSELVES ONHIS ATTENTION
 THIS COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN MORE GALLING TO ANYDISPOSITION THAN TO LYDGATES WITH HIS INTENSE PRIDEHIS DISLIKE OFASKING A FAVOR OR BEING UNDER AN OBLIGATION TO ANY ONE
 HE HAD SCORNEDEVEN TO FORM CONJECTURES ABOUT MR
 VINCYS INTENTIONS ON MONEY MATTERSAND NOTHING BUT EXTREMITY COULD HAVE INDUCED HIM TO APPLY TO HISFATHERINLAW EVEN IF HE HAD NOT BEEN MADE AWARE IN VARIOUS INDIRECTWAYS SINCE HIS MARRIAGE THAT MR
 VINCYS OWN AFFAIRS WERE NOTFLOURISHING AND THAT THE EXPECTATION OF HELP FROM HIM WOULD BERESENTED
 SOME MEN EASILY TRUST IN THE READINESS OF FRIENDS IT HADNEVER IN THE FORMER PART OF HIS LIFE OCCURRED TO LYDGATE THAT HE SHOULDNEED TO DO SO HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT WHAT BORROWING WOULD BE TO HIM BUTNOW THAT THE IDEA HAD ENTERED HIS MIND HE FELT THAT HE WOULD RATHERINCUR ANY OTHER HARDSHIP
 IN THE MEAN TIME HE HAD NO MONEY OR PROSPECTSOF MONEY AND HIS PRACTICE WAS NOT GETTING MORE LUCRATIVE
NO WONDER THAT LYDGATE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO SUPPRESS ALL SIGNS OF INWARDTROUBLE DURING THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND NOW THAT ROSAMOND WAS REGAININGBRILLIANT HEALTH HE MEDITATED TAKING HER ENTIRELY INTO CONFIDENCE ONHIS DIFFICULTIES
 NEW CONVERSANCE WITH TRADESMENS BILLS HAD FORCED HISREASONING INTO A NEW CHANNEL OF COMPARISON HE HAD BEGUN TO CONSIDERFROM A NEW POINT OF VIEW WHAT WAS NECESSARY AND UNNECESSARY IN GOODSORDERED AND TO SEE THAT THERE MUST BE SOME CHANGE OF HABITS
 HOW COULDSUCH A CHANGE BE MADE WITHOUT ROSAMONDS CONCURRENCE
 THE IMMEDIATEOCCASION OF OPENING THE DISAGREEABLE FACT TO HER WAS FORCED UPON HIM
HAVING NO MONEY AND HAVING PRIVATELY SOUGHT ADVICE AS TO WHAT SECURITYCOULD POSSIBLY BE GIVEN BY A MAN IN HIS POSITION LYDGATE HAD OFFEREDTHE ONE GOOD SECURITY IN HIS POWER TO THE LESS PEREMPTORY CREDITOR WHOWAS A SILVERSMITH AND JEWELLER AND WHO CONSENTED TO TAKE ON HIMSELFTHE UPHOLSTERERS CREDIT ALSO ACCEPTING INTEREST FOR A GIVEN TERM
 THESECURITY NECESSARY WAS A BILL OF SALE ON THE FURNITURE OF HIS HOUSEWHICH MIGHT MAKE A CREDITOR EASY FOR A REASONABLE TIME ABOUT A DEBTAMOUNTING TO LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS AND THE SILVERSMITH MR
DOVER WAS WILLING TO REDUCE IT BY TAKING BACK A PORTION OF THE PLATEAND ANY OTHER ARTICLE WHICH WAS AS GOOD AS NEW
 ANY OTHER ARTICLE WASA PHRASE DELICATELY IMPLYING JEWELLERY AND MORE PARTICULARLY SOMEPURPLE AMETHYSTS COSTING THIRTY POUNDS WHICH LYDGATE HAD BOUGHT AS ABRIDAL PRESENT
OPINIONS MAY BE DIVIDED AS TO HIS WISDOM IN MAKING THIS PRESENT SOMEMAY THINK THAT IT WAS A GRACEFUL ATTENTION TO BE EXPECTED FROM A MANLIKE LYDGATE AND THAT THE FAULT OF ANY TROUBLESOME CONSEQUENCES LAY INTHE PINCHED NARROWNESS OF PROVINCIAL LIFE AT THAT TIME WHICH OFFEREDNO CONVENIENCES FOR PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE WHOSE FORTUNE WAS NOTPROPORTIONED TO THEIR TASTES ALSO IN LYDGATES RIDICULOUSFASTIDIOUSNESS ABOUT ASKING HIS FRIENDS FOR MONEY
HOWEVER IT HAD SEEMED A QUESTION OF NO MOMENT TO HIM ON THAT FINEMORNING WHEN HE WENT TO GIVE A FINAL ORDER FOR PLATE IN THE PRESENCEOF OTHER JEWELS ENORMOUSLY EXPENSIVE AND AS AN ADDITION TO ORDERS OFWHICH THE AMOUNT HAD NOT BEEN EXACTLY CALCULATED THIRTY POUNDS FORORNAMENTS SO EXQUISITELY SUITED TO ROSAMONDS NECK AND ARMS COULDHARDLY APPEAR EXCESSIVE WHEN THERE WAS NO READY CASH FOR IT TO EXCEED
BUT AT THIS CRISIS LYDGATES IMAGINATION COULD NOT HELP DWELLING ON THEPOSSIBILITY OF LETTING THE AMETHYSTS TAKE THEIR PLACE AGAIN AMONG MR
DOVERS STOCK THOUGH HE SHRANK FROM THE IDEA OF PROPOSING THIS TOROSAMOND
 HAVING BEEN ROUSED TO DISCERN CONSEQUENCES WHICH HE HAD NEVERBEEN IN THE HABIT OF TRACING HE WAS PREPARING TO ACT ON THISDISCERNMENT WITH SOME OF THE RIGOR BY NO MEANS ALL THAT HE WOULD HAVEAPPLIED IN PURSUING EXPERIMENT
 HE WAS NERVING HIMSELF TO THIS RIGOR ASHE RODE FROM BRASSING AND MEDITATED ON THE REPRESENTATIONS HE MUSTMAKE TO ROSAMOND
IT WAS EVENING WHEN HE GOT HOME
 HE WAS INTENSELY MISERABLE THISSTRONG MAN OF NINEANDTWENTY AND OF MANY GIFTS
 HE WAS NOT SAYINGANGRILY WITHIN HIMSELF THAT HE HAD MADE A PROFOUND MISTAKE BUT THEMISTAKE WAS AT WORK IN HIM LIKE A RECOGNIZED CHRONIC DISEASE MINGLINGITS UNEASY IMPORTUNITIES WITH EVERY PROSPECT AND ENFEEBLING EVERYTHOUGHT
 AS HE WENT ALONG THE PASSAGE TO THE DRAWINGROOM HE HEARD THEPIANO AND SINGING
 OF COURSE LADISLAW WAS THERE
 IT WAS SOME WEEKSSINCE WILL HAD PARTED FROM DOROTHEA YET HE WAS STILL AT THE OLD POSTIN MIDDLEMARCH
 LYDGATE HAD NO OBJECTION IN GENERAL TO LADISLAWSCOMING BUT JUST NOW HE WAS ANNOYED THAT HE COULD NOT FIND HIS HEARTHFREE
 WHEN HE OPENED THE DOOR THE TWO SINGERS WENT ON TOWARDS THEKEYNOTE RAISING THEIR EYES AND LOOKING AT HIM INDEED BUT NOTREGARDING HIS ENTRANCE AS AN INTERRUPTION
 TO A MAN GALLED WITH HISHARNESS AS POOR LYDGATE WAS IT IS NOT SOOTHING TO SEE TWO PEOPLEWARBLING AT HIM AS HE COMES IN WITH THE SENSE THAT THE PAINFUL DAY HASSTILL PAINS IN STORE
 HIS FACE ALREADY PALER THAN USUAL TOOK ON ASCOWL AS HE WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM AND FLUNG HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR
THE SINGERS FEELING THEMSELVES EXCUSED BY THE FACT THAT THEY HAD ONLYTHREE BARS TO SING NOW TURNED ROUND
HOW ARE YOU LYDGATE
 SAID WILL COMING FORWARD TO SHAKE HANDS
LYDGATE TOOK HIS HAND BUT DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO SPEAK
HAVE YOU DINED TERTIUS
 I EXPECTED YOU MUCH EARLIER SAID ROSAMONDWHO HAD ALREADY SEEN THAT HER HUSBAND WAS IN A HORRIBLE HUMOR
 SHESEATED HERSELF IN HER USUAL PLACE AS SHE SPOKE
I HAVE DINED
 I SHOULD LIKE SOME TEA PLEASE SAID LYDGATE CURTLYSTILL SCOWLING AND LOOKING MARKEDLY AT HIS LEGS STRETCHED OUT BEFOREHIM
WILL WAS TOO QUICK TO NEED MORE
 I SHALL BE OFF HE SAID REACHINGHIS HAT
TEA IS COMING SAID ROSAMOND PRAY DONT GO
YES LYDGATE IS BORED SAID WILL WHO HAD MORE COMPREHENSION OFLYDGATE THAN ROSAMOND HAD AND WAS NOT OFFENDED BY HIS MANNER EASILYIMAGINING OUTDOOR CAUSES OF ANNOYANCE
THERE IS THE MORE NEED FOR YOU TO STAY SAID ROSAMOND PLAYFULLY ANDIN HER LIGHTEST ACCENT HE WILL NOT SPEAK TO ME ALL THE EVENING
YES ROSAMOND I SHALL SAID LYDGATE IN HIS STRONG BARITONE
 I HAVESOME SERIOUS BUSINESS TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT
NO INTRODUCTION OF THE BUSINESS COULD HAVE BEEN LESS LIKE THAT WHICHLYDGATE HAD INTENDED BUT HER INDIFFERENT MANNER HAD BEEN TOOPROVOKING
THERE
 YOU SEE SAID WILL
 IM GOING TO THE MEETING ABOUT THEMECHANICS INSTITUTE
 GOODBY AND HE WENT QUICKLY OUT OF THE ROOM
ROSAMOND DID NOT LOOK AT HER HUSBAND BUT PRESENTLY ROSE AND TOOK HERPLACE BEFORE THE TEATRAY
 SHE WAS THINKING THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIMSO DISAGREEABLE
 LYDGATE TURNED HIS DARK EYES ON HER AND WATCHED HER ASSHE DELICATELY HANDLED THE TEASERVICE WITH HER TAPER FINGERS ANDLOOKED AT THE OBJECTS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE HER WITH NO CURVE IN HER FACEDISTURBED AND YET WITH AN INEFFABLE PROTEST IN HER AIR AGAINST ALLPEOPLE WITH UNPLEASANT MANNERS
 FOR THE MOMENT HE LOST THE SENSE OF HISWOUND IN A SUDDEN SPECULATION ABOUT THIS NEW FORM OF FEMININEIMPASSIBILITY REVEALING ITSELF IN THE SYLPHLIKE FRAME WHICH HE HADONCE INTERPRETED AS THE SIGN OF A READY INTELLIGENT SENSITIVENESS
 HISMIND GLANCING BACK TO LAURE WHILE HE LOOKED AT ROSAMOND HE SAIDINWARDLY WOULD SHE KILL ME BECAUSE I WEARIED HER
 AND THEN IT ISTHE WAY WITH ALL WOMEN
 BUT THIS POWER OF GENERALIZING WHICH GIVES MENSO MUCH THE SUPERIORITY IN MISTAKE OVER THE DUMB ANIMALS WASIMMEDIATELY THWARTED BY LYDGATES MEMORY OF WONDERING IMPRESSIONS FROMTHE BEHAVIOR OF ANOTHER WOMANFROM DOROTHEAS LOOKS AND TONES OFEMOTION ABOUT HER HUSBAND WHEN LYDGATE BEGAN TO ATTEND HIMFROM HERPASSIONATE CRY TO BE TAUGHT WHAT WOULD BEST COMFORT THAT MAN FOR WHOSESAKE IT SEEMED AS IF SHE MUST QUELL EVERY IMPULSE IN HER EXCEPT THEYEARNINGS OF FAITHFULNESS AND COMPASSION
 THESE REVIVED IMPRESSIONSSUCCEEDED EACH OTHER QUICKLY AND DREAMILY IN LYDGATES MIND WHILE THETEA WAS BEING BREWED
 HE HAD SHUT HIS EYES IN THE LAST INSTANT OFREVERIE WHILE HE HEARD DOROTHEA SAYING ADVISE METHINK WHAT I CANDOHE HAS BEEN ALL HIS LIFE LABORING AND LOOKING FORWARD
 HE MINDSABOUT NOTHING ELSEAND I MIND ABOUT NOTHING ELSE
THAT VOICE OF DEEPSOULED WOMANHOOD HAD REMAINED WITHIN HIM AS THEENKINDLING CONCEPTIONS OF DEAD AND SCEPTRED GENIUS HAD REMAINED WITHINHIM IS THERE NOT A GENIUS FOR FEELING NOBLY WHICH ALSO REIGNS OVERHUMAN SPIRITS AND THEIR CONCLUSIONS
 THE TONES WERE A MUSIC FROMWHICH HE WAS FALLING AWAYHE HAD REALLY FALLEN INTO A MOMENTARY DOZEWHEN ROSAMOND SAID IN HER SILVERY NEUTRAL WAY HERE IS YOUR TEATERTIUS SETTING IT ON THE SMALL TABLE BY HIS SIDE AND THEN MOVEDBACK TO HER PLACE WITHOUT LOOKING AT HIM
 LYDGATE WAS TOO HASTY INATTRIBUTING INSENSIBILITY TO HER AFTER HER OWN FASHION SHE WASSENSITIVE ENOUGH AND TOOK LASTING IMPRESSIONS
 HER IMPRESSION NOW WASONE OF OFFENCE AND REPULSION
 BUT THEN ROSAMOND HAD NO SCOWLS AND HADNEVER RAISED HER VOICE SHE WAS QUITE SURE THAT NO ONE COULD JUSTLYFIND FAULT WITH HER
PERHAPS LYDGATE AND SHE HAD NEVER FELT SO FAR OFF EACH OTHER BEFOREBUT THERE WERE STRONG REASONS FOR NOT DEFERRING HIS REVELATION EVEN IFHE HAD NOT ALREADY BEGUN IT BY THAT ABRUPT ANNOUNCEMENT INDEED SOME OFTHE ANGRY DESIRE TO ROUSE HER INTO MORE SENSIBILITY ON HIS ACCOUNTWHICH HAD PROMPTED HIM TO SPEAK PREMATURELY STILL MINGLED WITH HISPAIN IN THE PROSPECT OF HER PAIN
 BUT HE WAITED TILL THE TRAY WAS GONETHE CANDLES WERE LIT AND THE EVENING QUIET MIGHT BE COUNTED ON THEINTERVAL HAD LEFT TIME FOR REPELLED TENDERNESS TO RETURN INTO THE OLDCOURSE
 HE SPOKE KINDLY
DEAR ROSY LAY DOWN YOUR WORK AND COME TO SIT BY ME HE SAID GENTLYPUSHING AWAY THE TABLE AND STRETCHING OUT HIS ARM TO DRAW A CHAIR NEARHIS OWN
ROSAMOND OBEYED
 AS SHE CAME TOWARDS HIM IN HER DRAPERY OF TRANSPARENTFAINTLY TINTED MUSLIN HER SLIM YET ROUND FIGURE NEVER LOOKED MOREGRACEFUL AS SHE SAT DOWN BY HIM AND LAID ONE HAND ON THE ELBOW OF HISCHAIR AT LAST LOOKING AT HIM AND MEETING HIS EYES HER DELICATE NECKAND CHEEK AND PURELY CUT LIPS NEVER HAD MORE OF THAT UNTARNISHED BEAUTYWHICH TOUCHES AS IN SPRINGTIME AND INFANCY AND ALL SWEET FRESHNESS
 ITTOUCHED LYDGATE NOW AND MINGLED THE EARLY MOMENTS OF HIS LOVE FOR HERWITH ALL THE OTHER MEMORIES WHICH WERE STIRRED IN THIS CRISIS OF DEEPTROUBLE
 HE LAID HIS AMPLE HAND SOFTLY ON HERS SAYINGDEAR
 WITH THE LINGERING UTTERANCE WHICH AFFECTION GIVES TO THE WORD
ROSAMOND TOO WAS STILL UNDER THE POWER OF THAT SAME PAST AND HERHUSBAND WAS STILL IN PART THE LYDGATE WHOSE APPROVAL HAD STIRREDDELIGHT
 SHE PUT HIS HAIR LIGHTLY AWAY FROM HIS FOREHEAD THEN LAID HEROTHER HAND ON HIS AND WAS CONSCIOUS OF FORGIVING HIM
I AM OBLIGED TO TELL YOU WHAT WILL HURT YOU ROSY
 BUT THERE ARETHINGS WHICH HUSBAND AND WIFE MUST THINK OF TOGETHER
 I DARE SAY IT HASOCCURRED TO YOU ALREADY THAT I AM SHORT OF MONEY
LYDGATE PAUSED BUT ROSAMOND TURNED HER NECK AND LOOKED AT A VASE ONTHE MANTELPIECE
I WAS NOT ABLE TO PAY FOR ALL THE THINGS WE HAD TO GET BEFORE WE WEREMARRIED AND THERE HAVE BEEN EXPENSES SINCE WHICH I HAVE BEEN OBLIGEDTO MEET
 THE CONSEQUENCE IS THERE IS A LARGE DEBT AT BRASSINGTHREEHUNDRED AND EIGHTY POUNDSWHICH HAS BEEN PRESSING ON ME A GOOD WHILEAND IN FACT WE ARE GETTING DEEPER EVERY DAY FOR PEOPLE DONT PAY METHE FASTER BECAUSE OTHERS WANT THE MONEY
 I TOOK PAINS TO KEEP IT FROMYOU WHILE YOU WERE NOT WELL BUT NOW WE MUST THINK TOGETHER ABOUT ITAND YOU MUST HELP ME
WHAT CAN I DO TERTIUS
 SAID ROSAMOND TURNING HER EYES ON HIMAGAIN
 THAT LITTLE SPEECH OF FOUR WORDS LIKE SO MANY OTHERS IN ALLLANGUAGES IS CAPABLE BY VARIED VOCAL INFLECTIONS OF EXPRESSING ALLSTATES OF MIND FROM HELPLESS DIMNESS TO EXHAUSTIVE ARGUMENTATIVEPERCEPTION FROM THE COMPLETEST SELFDEVOTING FELLOWSHIP TO THE MOSTNEUTRAL ALOOFNESS
 ROSAMONDS THIN UTTERANCE THREW INTO THE WORDS WHATCANIDO
 AS MUCH NEUTRALITY AS THEY COULD HOLD
 THEY FELL LIKE AMORTAL CHILL ON LYDGATES ROUSED TENDERNESS
 HE DID NOT STORM ININDIGNATIONHE FELT TOO SAD A SINKING OF THE HEART
 AND WHEN HE SPOKEAGAIN IT WAS MORE IN THE TONE OF A MAN WHO FORCES HIMSELF TO FULFIL ATASK
IT IS NECESSARY FOR YOU TO KNOW BECAUSE I HAVE TO GIVE SECURITY FOR ATIME AND A MAN MUST COME TO MAKE AN INVENTORY OF THE FURNITURE
ROSAMOND COLORED DEEPLY
 HAVE YOU NOT ASKED PAPA FOR MONEY
 SHE SAIDAS SOON AS SHE COULD SPEAK
NO
THEN I MUST ASK HIM
 SHE SAID RELEASING HER HANDS FROM LYDGATESAND RISING TO STAND AT TWO YARDS DISTANCE FROM HIM
NO ROSY SAID LYDGATE DECISIVELY
 IT IS TOO LATE TO DO THAT
 THEINVENTORY WILL BE BEGUN TOMORROW
 REMEMBER IT IS A MERE SECURITY ITWILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE IT IS A TEMPORARY AFFAIR
 I INSIST UPON ITTHAT YOUR FATHER SHALL NOT KNOW UNLESS I CHOOSE TO TELL HIM ADDEDLYDGATE WITH A MORE PEREMPTORY EMPHASIS
THIS CERTAINLY WAS UNKIND BUT ROSAMOND HAD THROWN HIM BACK ON EVILEXPECTATION AS TO WHAT SHE WOULD DO IN THE WAY OF QUIET STEADYDISOBEDIENCE
 THE UNKINDNESS SEEMED UNPARDONABLE TO HER SHE WAS NOTGIVEN TO WEEPING AND DISLIKED IT BUT NOW HER CHIN AND LIPS BEGAN TOTREMBLE AND THE TEARS WELLED UP
 PERHAPS IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FORLYDGATE UNDER THE DOUBLE STRESS OF OUTWARD MATERIAL DIFFICULTY AND OFHIS OWN PROUD RESISTANCE TO HUMILIATING CONSEQUENCES TO IMAGINE FULLYWHAT THIS SUDDEN TRIAL WAS TO A YOUNG CREATURE WHO HAD KNOWN NOTHINGBUT INDULGENCE AND WHOSE DREAMS HAD ALL BEEN OF NEW INDULGENCE MOREEXACTLY TO HER TASTE
 BUT HE DID WISH TO SPARE HER AS MUCH AS HE COULDAND HER TEARS CUT HIM TO THE HEART
 HE COULD NOT SPEAK AGAINIMMEDIATELY BUT ROSAMOND DID NOT GO ON SOBBING SHE TRIED TO CONQUERHER AGITATION AND WIPED AWAY HER TEARS CONTINUING TO LOOK BEFORE HERAT THE MANTELPIECE
TRY NOT TO GRIEVE DARLING SAID LYDGATE TURNING HIS EYES UP TOWARDSHER
 THAT SHE HAD CHOSEN TO MOVE AWAY FROM HIM IN THIS MOMENT OF HERTROUBLE MADE EVERYTHING HARDER TO SAY BUT HE MUST ABSOLUTELY GO ON
WE MUST BRACE OURSELVES TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY
 IT IS I WHO HAVE BEENIN FAULT I OUGHT TO HAVE SEEN THAT I COULD NOT AFFORD TO LIVE IN THISWAY
 BUT MANY THINGS HAVE TOLD AGAINST ME IN MY PRACTICE AND IT REALLYJUST NOW HAS EBBED TO A LOW POINT
 I MAY RECOVER IT BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE MUST PULL UPWE MUST CHANGE OUR WAY OF LIVING
 WE SHALL WEATHERIT
 WHEN I HAVE GIVEN THIS SECURITY I SHALL HAVE TIME TO LOOK ABOUT MEAND YOU ARE SO CLEVER THAT IF YOU TURN YOUR MIND TO MANAGING YOU WILLSCHOOL ME INTO CAREFULNESS
 I HAVE BEEN A THOUGHTLESS RASCAL ABOUTSQUARING PRICESBUT COME DEAR SIT DOWN AND FORGIVE ME
LYDGATE WAS BOWING HIS NECK UNDER THE YOKE LIKE A CREATURE WHO HADTALONS BUT WHO HAD REASON TOO WHICH OFTEN REDUCES US TO MEEKNESS
WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN THE LAST WORDS IN AN IMPLORING TONE ROSAMONDRETURNED TO THE CHAIR BY HIS SIDE
 HIS SELFBLAME GAVE HER SOME HOPETHAT HE WOULD ATTEND TO HER OPINION AND SHE SAIDWHY CAN YOU NOT PUT OFF HAVING THE INVENTORY MADE
 YOU CAN SEND THEMEN AWAY TOMORROW WHEN THEY COME
I SHALL NOT SEND THEM AWAY SAID LYDGATE THE PEREMPTORINESS RISINGAGAIN
 WAS IT OF ANY USE TO EXPLAIN
IF WE LEFT MIDDLEMARCH
 THERE WOULD OF COURSE BE A SALE AND THATWOULD DO AS WELL
BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO LEAVE MIDDLEMARCH
I AM SURE TERTIUS IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER TO DO SO
 WHY CAN WE NOTGO TO LONDON
 OR NEAR DURHAM WHERE YOUR FAMILY IS KNOWN
WE CAN GO NOWHERE WITHOUT MONEY ROSAMOND
YOUR FRIENDS WOULD NOT WISH YOU TO BE WITHOUT MONEY
 AND SURELY THESEODIOUS TRADESMEN MIGHT BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND TO WAIT IF YOUWOULD MAKE PROPER REPRESENTATIONS TO THEM
THIS IS IDLE ROSAMOND SAID LYDGATE ANGRILY
 YOU MUST LEARN TO TAKEMY JUDGMENT ON QUESTIONS YOU DONT UNDERSTAND
 I HAVE MADE NECESSARYARRANGEMENTS AND THEY MUST BE CARRIED OUT
 AS TO FRIENDS I HAVE NOEXPECTATIONS WHATEVER FROM THEM AND SHALL NOT ASK THEM FOR ANYTHING
ROSAMOND SAT PERFECTLY STILL
 THE THOUGHT IN HER MIND WAS THAT IF SHEHAD KNOWN HOW LYDGATE WOULD BEHAVE SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE MARRIED HIM
WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE NOW ON UNNECESSARY WORDS DEAR SAIDLYDGATE TRYING TO BE GENTLE AGAIN
 THERE ARE SOME DETAILS THAT I WANTTO CONSIDER WITH YOU
 DOVER SAYS HE WILL TAKE A GOOD DEAL OF THE PLATEBACK AGAIN AND ANY OF THE JEWELLERY WE LIKE
 HE REALLY BEHAVES VERYWELL
ARE WE TO GO WITHOUT SPOONS AND FORKS THEN
 SAID ROSAMOND WHOSE VERYLIPS SEEMED TO GET THINNER WITH THE THINNESS OF HER UTTERANCE
 SHE WASDETERMINED TO MAKE NO FURTHER RESISTANCE OR SUGGESTIONS
OH NO DEAR
 SAID LYDGATE
 BUT LOOK HERE HE CONTINUED DRAWING APAPER FROM HIS POCKET AND OPENING IT HERE IS DOVERS ACCOUNT
 SEE IHAVE MARKED A NUMBER OF ARTICLES WHICH IF WE RETURNED THEM WOULDREDUCE THE AMOUNT BY THIRTY POUNDS AND MORE
 I HAVE NOT MARKED ANY OFTHE JEWELLERY
 LYDGATE HAD REALLY FELT THIS POINT OF THE JEWELLERYVERY BITTER TO HIMSELF BUT HE HAD OVERCOME THE FEELING BY SEVEREARGUMENT
 HE COULD NOT PROPOSE TO ROSAMOND THAT SHE SHOULD RETURN ANYPARTICULAR PRESENT OF HIS BUT HE HAD TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE WAS BOUND TOPUT DOVERS OFFER BEFORE HER AND HER INWARD PROMPTING MIGHT MAKE THEAFFAIR EASY
IT IS USELESS FOR ME TO LOOK TERTIUS SAID ROSAMOND CALMLY YOUWILL RETURN WHAT YOU PLEASE
 SHE WOULD NOT TURN HER EYES ON THE PAPERAND LYDGATE FLUSHING UP TO THE ROOTS OF HIS HAIR DREW IT BACK AND LETIT FALL ON HIS KNEE
 MEANWHILE ROSAMOND QUIETLY WENT OUT OF THE ROOMLEAVING LYDGATE HELPLESS AND WONDERING
 WAS SHE NOT COMING BACK
 ITSEEMED THAT SHE HAD NO MORE IDENTIFIED HERSELF WITH HIM THAN IF THEYHAD BEEN CREATURES OF DIFFERENT SPECIES AND OPPOSING INTERESTS
 HETOSSED HIS HEAD AND THRUST HIS HANDS DEEP INTO HIS POCKETS WITH A SORTOF VENGEANCE
 THERE WAS STILL SCIENCETHERE WERE STILL GOOD OBJECTS TOWORK FOR
 HE MUST GIVE A TUG STILLALL THE STRONGER BECAUSE OTHERSATISFACTIONS WERE GOING
BUT THE DOOR OPENED AND ROSAMOND REENTERED
 SHE CARRIED THE LEATHERBOX CONTAINING THE AMETHYSTS AND A TINY ORNAMENTAL BASKET WHICHCONTAINED OTHER BOXES AND LAYING THEM ON THE CHAIR WHERE SHE HAD BEENSITTING SHE SAID WITH PERFECT PROPRIETY IN HER AIRTHIS IS ALL THE JEWELLERY YOU EVER GAVE ME
 YOU CAN RETURN WHAT YOULIKE OF IT AND OF THE PLATE ALSO
 YOU WILL NOT OF COURSE EXPECT METO STAY AT HOME TOMORROW
 I SHALL GO TO PAPAS
TO MANY WOMEN THE LOOK LYDGATE CAST AT HER WOULD HAVE BEEN MORETERRIBLE THAN ONE OF ANGER IT HAD IN IT A DESPAIRING ACCEPTANCE OF THEDISTANCE SHE WAS PLACING BETWEEN THEM
AND WHEN SHALL YOU COME BACK AGAIN
 HE SAID WITH A BITTER EDGE ONHIS ACCENT
OH IN THE EVENING
 OF COURSE I SHALL NOT MENTION THE SUBJECT TOMAMMA
 ROSAMOND WAS CONVINCED THAT NO WOMAN COULD BEHAVE MOREIRREPROACHABLY THAN SHE WAS BEHAVING AND SHE WENT TO SIT DOWN AT HERWORKTABLE
 LYDGATE SAT MEDITATING A MINUTE OR TWO AND THE RESULT WASTHAT HE SAID WITH SOME OF THE OLD EMOTION IN HIS TONENOW WE HAVE BEEN UNITED ROSY YOU SHOULD NOT LEAVE ME TO MYSELF INTHE FIRST TROUBLE THAT HAS COME
CERTAINLY NOT SAID ROSAMOND I SHALL DO EVERYTHING IT BECOMES ME TODO
IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT THE THING SHOULD BE LEFT TO SERVANTS OR THAT ISHOULD HAVE TO SPEAK TO THEM ABOUT IT
 AND I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO GOOUTI DONT KNOW HOW EARLY
 I UNDERSTAND YOUR SHRINKING FROM THEHUMILIATION OF THESE MONEY AFFAIRS
 BUT MY DEAR ROSAMOND AS AQUESTION OF PRIDE WHICH I FEEL JUST AS MUCH AS YOU CAN IT IS SURELYBETTER TO MANAGE THE THING OURSELVES AND LET THE SERVANTS SEE ASLITTLE OF IT AS POSSIBLE AND SINCE YOU ARE MY WIFE THERE IS NOHINDERING YOUR SHARE IN MY DISGRACESIF THERE WERE DISGRACES
ROSAMOND DID NOT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY BUT AT LAST SHE SAID VERY WELLI WILL STAY AT HOME
I SHALL NOT TOUCH THESE JEWELS ROSY
 TAKE THEM AWAY AGAIN
 BUT I WILLWRITE OUT A LIST OF PLATE THAT WE MAY RETURN AND THAT CAN BE PACKED UPAND SENT AT ONCE
THE SERVANTS WILL KNOW THAT SAID ROSAMOND WITH THE SLIGHTESTTOUCH OF SARCASM
WELL WE MUST MEET SOME DISAGREEABLES AS NECESSITIES
 WHERE IS THEINK I WONDER
 SAID LYDGATE RISING AND THROWING THE ACCOUNT ON THELARGER TABLE WHERE HE MEANT TO WRITE
ROSAMOND WENT TO REACH THE INKSTAND AND AFTER SETTING IT ON THE TABLEWAS GOING TO TURN AWAY WHEN LYDGATE WHO WAS STANDING CLOSE BY PUTHIS ARM ROUND HER AND DREW HER TOWARDS HIM SAYINGCOME DARLING LET US MAKE THE BEST OF THINGS
 IT WILL ONLY BE FOR ATIME I HOPE THAT WE SHALL HAVE TO BE STINGY AND PARTICULAR
 KISS ME
HIS NATIVE WARMHEARTEDNESS TOOK A GREAT DEAL OF QUENCHING AND IT IS APART OF MANLINESS FOR A HUSBAND TO FEEL KEENLY THE FACT THAT ANINEXPERIENCED GIRL HAS GOT INTO TROUBLE BY MARRYING HIM
 SHE RECEIVEDHIS KISS AND RETURNED IT FAINTLY AND IN THIS WAY AN APPEARANCE OFACCORD WAS RECOVERED FOR THE TIME
 BUT LYDGATE COULD NOT HELP LOOKINGFORWARD WITH DREAD TO THE INEVITABLE FUTURE DISCUSSIONS ABOUTEXPENDITURE AND THE NECESSITY FOR A COMPLETE CHANGE IN THEIR WAY OFLIVING
CHAPTER LIX
THEY SAID OF OLD THE SOUL HAD HUMAN SHAPEBUT SMALLER SUBTLER THAN THE FLESHLY SELFSO WANDERED FORTH FOR AIRING WHEN IT PLEASED
AND SEE
 BESIDE HER CHERUBFACE THERE FLOATSA PALELIPPED FORM AERIAL WHISPERINGITS PROMPTINGS IN THAT LITTLE SHELL HER EAR
NEWS IS OFTEN DISPERSED AS THOUGHTLESSLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS THAT POLLENWHICH THE BEES CARRY OFF HAVING NO IDEA HOW POWDERY THEY ARE WHENTHEY ARE BUZZING IN SEARCH OF THEIR PARTICULAR NECTAR
 THIS FINECOMPARISON HAS REFERENCE TO FRED VINCY WHO ON THAT EVENING AT LOWICKPARSONAGE HEARD A LIVELY DISCUSSION AMONG THE LADIES ON THE NEWS WHICHTHEIR OLD SERVANT HAD GOT FROM TANTRIPP CONCERNING MR
 CASAUBONSSTRANGE MENTION OF MR
 LADISLAW IN A CODICIL TO HIS WILL MADE NOT LONGBEFORE HIS DEATH
 MISS WINIFRED WAS ASTOUNDED TO FIND THAT HER BROTHERHAD KNOWN THE FACT BEFORE AND OBSERVED THAT CAMDEN WAS THE MOSTWONDERFUL MAN FOR KNOWING THINGS AND NOT TELLING THEM WHEREUPON MARYGARTH SAID THAT THE CODICIL HAD PERHAPS GOT MIXED UP WITH THE HABITS OFSPIDERS WHICH MISS WINIFRED NEVER WOULD LISTEN TO
 MRS
 FAREBROTHERCONSIDERED THAT THE NEWS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THEIR HAVING ONLYONCE SEEN MR
 LADISLAW AT LOWICK AND MISS NOBLE MADE MANY SMALLCOMPASSIONATE MEWINGS
FRED KNEW LITTLE AND CARED LESS ABOUT LADISLAW AND THE CASAUBONS ANDHIS MIND NEVER RECURRED TO THAT DISCUSSION TILL ONE DAY CALLING ONROSAMOND AT HIS MOTHERS REQUEST TO DELIVER A MESSAGE AS HE PASSED HEHAPPENED TO SEE LADISLAW GOING AWAY
 FRED AND ROSAMOND HAD LITTLE TOSAY TO EACH OTHER NOW THAT MARRIAGE HAD REMOVED HER FROM COLLISION WITHTHE UNPLEASANTNESS OF BROTHERS AND ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HE HAD TAKENWHAT SHE HELD THE STUPID AND EVEN REPREHENSIBLE STEP OF GIVING UP THECHURCH TO TAKE TO SUCH A BUSINESS AS MR
 GARTHS
 HENCE FRED TALKED BYPREFERENCE OF WHAT HE CONSIDERED INDIFFERENT NEWS AND A PROPOS OFTHAT YOUNG LADISLAW MENTIONED WHAT HE HAD HEARD AT LOWICK PARSONAGE
NOW LYDGATE LIKE MR
 FAREBROTHER KNEW A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN HE TOLDAND WHEN HE HAD ONCE BEEN SET THINKING ABOUT THE RELATION BETWEEN WILLAND DOROTHEA HIS CONJECTURES HAD GONE BEYOND THE FACT
 HE IMAGINED THATTHERE WAS A PASSIONATE ATTACHMENT ON BOTH SIDES AND THIS STRUCK HIM ASMUCH TOO SERIOUS TO GOSSIP ABOUT
 HE REMEMBERED WILLS IRRITABILITYWHEN HE HAD MENTIONED MRS
 CASAUBON AND WAS THE MORE CIRCUMSPECT
 ONTHE WHOLE HIS SURMISES IN ADDITION TO WHAT HE KNEW OF THE FACTINCREASED HIS FRIENDLINESS AND TOLERANCE TOWARDS LADISLAW AND MADE HIMUNDERSTAND THE VACILLATION WHICH KEPT HIM AT MIDDLEMARCH AFTER HE HADSAID THAT HE SHOULD GO AWAY
 IT WAS SIGNIFICANT OF THE SEPARATENESSBETWEEN LYDGATES MIND AND ROSAMONDS THAT HE HAD NO IMPULSE TO SPEAKTO HER ON THE SUBJECT INDEED HE DID NOT QUITE TRUST HER RETICENCETOWARDS WILL
 AND HE WAS RIGHT THERE THOUGH HE HAD NO VISION OF THEWAY IN WHICH HER MIND WOULD ACT IN URGING HER TO SPEAK
WHEN SHE REPEATED FREDS NEWS TO LYDGATE HE SAID TAKE CARE YOU DONTDROP THE FAINTEST HINT TO LADISLAW ROSY
 HE IS LIKELY TO FLY OUT AS IFYOU INSULTED HIM
 OF COURSE IT IS A PAINFUL AFFAIR
ROSAMOND TURNED HER NECK AND PATTED HER HAIR LOOKING THE IMAGE OFPLACID INDIFFERENCE
 BUT THE NEXT TIME WILL CAME WHEN LYDGATE WAS AWAYSHE SPOKE ARCHLY ABOUT HIS NOT GOING TO LONDON AS HE HAD THREATENED
I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT
 I HAVE A CONFIDENTIAL LITTLE BIRD SAID SHESHOWING VERY PRETTY AIRS OF HER HEAD OVER THE BIT OF WORK HELD HIGHBETWEEN HER ACTIVE FINGERS
 THERE IS A POWERFUL MAGNET IN THISNEIGHBORHOOD
TO BE SURE THERE IS
 NOBODY KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN YOU SAID WILLWITH LIGHT GALLANTRY BUT INWARDLY PREPARED TO BE ANGRY
IT IS REALLY THE MOST CHARMING ROMANCE MR
 CASAUBON JEALOUS ANDFORESEEING THAT THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE WHOM MRS
 CASAUBON WOULD SO MUCHLIKE TO MARRY AND NO ONE WHO WOULD SO MUCH LIKE TO MARRY HER AS ACERTAIN GENTLEMAN AND THEN LAYING A PLAN TO SPOIL ALL BY MAKING HERFORFEIT HER PROPERTY IF SHE DID MARRY THAT GENTLEMANAND THENANDTHENAND THENOH I HAVE NO DOUBT THE END WILL BE THOROUGHLY ROMANTIC
GREAT GOD
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN
 SAID WILL FLUSHING OVER FACE AND EARSHIS FEATURES SEEMING TO CHANGE AS IF HE HAD HAD A VIOLENT SHAKE
 DONTJOKE TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN
YOU DONT REALLY KNOW
 SAID ROSAMOND NO LONGER PLAYFUL AND DESIRINGNOTHING BETTER THAN TO TELL IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT EVOKE EFFECTS
NO
 HE RETURNED IMPATIENTLY
DONT KNOW THAT MR
 CASAUBON HAS LEFT IT IN HIS WILL THAT IF MRS
CASAUBON MARRIES YOU SHE IS TO FORFEIT ALL HER PROPERTY
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT IT IS TRUE
 SAID WILL EAGERLY
MY BROTHER FRED HEARD IT FROM THE FAREBROTHERS
 WILL STARTED UP FROMHIS CHAIR AND REACHED HIS HAT
I DARE SAY SHE LIKES YOU BETTER THAN THE PROPERTY SAID ROSAMONDLOOKING AT HIM FROM A DISTANCE
PRAY DONT SAY ANY MORE ABOUT IT SAID WILL IN A HOARSE UNDERTONEEXTREMELY UNLIKE HIS USUAL LIGHT VOICE
 IT IS A FOUL INSULT TO HER ANDTO ME
 THEN HE SAT DOWN ABSENTLY LOOKING BEFORE HIM BUT SEEINGNOTHING
NOW YOU ARE ANGRY WITH ME SAID ROSAMOND
 IT IS TOO BAD TO BEARME MALICE
 YOU OUGHT TO BE OBLIGED TO ME FOR TELLING YOU
SO I AM SAID WILL ABRUPTLY SPEAKING WITH THAT KIND OF DOUBLE SOULWHICH BELONGS TO DREAMERS WHO ANSWER QUESTIONS
I EXPECT TO HEAR OF THE MARRIAGE SAID ROSAMOND PLAYFULLY
NEVER
 YOU WILL NEVER HEAR OF THE MARRIAGE
WITH THOSE WORDS UTTERED IMPETUOUSLY WILL ROSE PUT OUT HIS HAND TOROSAMOND STILL WITH THE AIR OF A SOMNAMBULIST AND WENT AWAY
WHEN HE WAS GONE ROSAMOND LEFT HER CHAIR AND WALKED TO THE OTHER ENDOF THE ROOM LEANING WHEN SHE GOT THERE AGAINST A CHIFFONNIERE ANDLOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW WEARILY
 SHE WAS OPPRESSED BY ENNUI AND BYTHAT DISSATISFACTION WHICH IN WOMENS MINDS IS CONTINUALLY TURNING INTOA TRIVIAL JEALOUSY REFERRING TO NO REAL CLAIMS SPRINGING FROM NODEEPER PASSION THAN THE VAGUE EXACTINGNESS OF EGOISM AND YET CAPABLEOF IMPELLING ACTION AS WELL AS SPEECH
 THERE REALLY IS NOTHING TO CAREFOR MUCH SAID POOR ROSAMOND INWARDLY THINKING OF THE FAMILY ATQUALLINGHAM WHO DID NOT WRITE TO HER AND THAT PERHAPS TERTIUS WHEN HECAME HOME WOULD TEASE HER ABOUT EXPENSES
 SHE HAD ALREADY SECRETLYDISOBEYED HIM BY ASKING HER FATHER TO HELP THEM AND HE HAD ENDEDDECISIVELY BY SAYING I AM MORE LIKELY TO WANT HELP MYSELF
CHAPTER LX
GOOD PHRASES ARE SURELY AND EVER WERE VERY COMMENDABLE
JUSTICE SHALLOW
A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDSIT WAS ALREADY THE END OF AUGUSTTHERE WAS ANOCCASION WHICH CAUSED SOME EXCITEMENT IN MIDDLEMARCH THE PUBLIC IF ITCHOSE WAS TO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BUYING UNDER THE DISTINGUISHEDAUSPICES OF MR
 BORTHROP TRUMBULL THE FURNITURE BOOKS AND PICTURESWHICH ANYBODY MIGHT SEE BY THE HANDBILLS TO BE THE BEST IN EVERY KINDBELONGING TO EDWIN LARCHER ESQ
 THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THE SALESINDICATING THE DEPRESSION OF TRADE ON THE CONTRARY IT WAS DUE TO MR
LARCHERS GREAT SUCCESS IN THE CARRYING BUSINESS WHICH WARRANTED HISPURCHASE OF A MANSION NEAR RIVERSTON ALREADY FURNISHED IN HIGH STYLE BYAN ILLUSTRIOUS SPA PHYSICIANFURNISHED INDEED WITH SUCH LARGE FRAMEFULSOF EXPENSIVE FLESHPAINTING IN THE DININGROOM THAT MRS
 LARCHER WASNERVOUS UNTIL REASSURED BY FINDING THE SUBJECTS TO BE SCRIPTURAL
 HENCETHE FINE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASERS WHICH WAS WELL POINTED OUT IN THEHANDBILLS OF MR
 BORTHROP TRUMBULL WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE HISTORYOF ART ENABLED HIM TO STATE THAT THE HALL FURNITURE TO BE SOLD WITHOUTRESERVE COMPRISED A PIECE OF CARVING BY A CONTEMPORARY OF GIBBONS
AT MIDDLEMARCH IN THOSE TIMES A LARGE SALE WAS REGARDED AS A KIND OFFESTIVAL
 THERE WAS A TABLE SPREAD WITH THE BEST COLD EATABLES AS AT ASUPERIOR FUNERAL AND FACILITIES WERE OFFERED FOR THATGENEROUSDRINKING OF CHEERFUL GLASSES WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO GENEROUS ANDCHEERFUL BIDDING FOR UNDESIRABLE ARTICLES
 MR
 LARCHERS SALE WAS THEMORE ATTRACTIVE IN THE FINE WEATHER BECAUSE THE HOUSE STOOD JUST AT THEEND OF THE TOWN WITH A GARDEN AND STABLES ATTACHED IN THAT PLEASANTISSUE FROM MIDDLEMARCH CALLED THE LONDON ROAD WHICH WAS ALSO THE ROADTO THE NEW HOSPITAL AND TO MR
 BULSTRODES RETIRED RESIDENCE KNOWN ASTHE SHRUBS
 IN SHORT THE AUCTION WAS AS GOOD AS A FAIR AND DREW ALLCLASSES WITH LEISURE AT COMMAND TO SOME WHO RISKED MAKING BIDS INORDER SIMPLY TO RAISE PRICES IT WAS ALMOST EQUAL TO BETTING AT THERACES
 THE SECOND DAY WHEN THE BEST FURNITURE WAS TO BE SOLDEVERYBODY WAS THERE EVEN MR
 THESIGER THE RECTOR OF ST
 PETERSHAD LOOKED IN FOR A SHORT TIME WISHING TO BUY THE CARVED TABLE ANDHAD RUBBED ELBOWS WITH MR
 BAMBRIDGE AND MR
 HORROCK
 THERE WAS AWREATH OF MIDDLEMARCH LADIES ACCOMMODATED WITH SEATS ROUND THE LARGETABLE IN THE DININGROOM WHERE MR
 BORTHROP TRUMBULL WAS MOUNTED WITHDESK AND HAMMER BUT THE ROWS CHIEFLY OF MASCULINE FACES BEHIND WEREOFTEN VARIED BY INCOMINGS AND OUTGOINGS BOTH FROM THE DOOR AND THELARGE BOWWINDOW OPENING ON TO THE LAWN
EVERYBODY THAT DAY DID NOT INCLUDE MR
 BULSTRODE WHOSE HEALTH COULDNOT WELL ENDURE CROWDS AND DRAUGHTS
 BUT MRS
 BULSTRODE HADPARTICULARLY WISHED TO HAVE A CERTAIN PICTUREA SUPPER AT EMMAUSATTRIBUTED IN THE CATALOGUE TO GUIDO AND AT THE LAST MOMENT BEFORE THEDAY OF THE SALE MR
 BULSTRODE HAD CALLED AT THE OFFICE OF THEPIONEER OF WHICH HE WAS NOW ONE OF THE PROPRIETORS TO BEG OF MR
LADISLAW AS A GREAT FAVOR THAT HE WOULD OBLIGINGLY USE HIS REMARKABLEKNOWLEDGE OF PICTURES ON BEHALF OF MRS
 BULSTRODE AND JUDGE OF THEVALUE OF THIS PARTICULAR PAINTINGIF ADDED THE SCRUPULOUSLY POLITEBANKER ATTENDANCE AT THE SALE WOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH THEARRANGEMENTS FOR YOUR DEPARTURE WHICH I KNOW IS IMMINENT
THIS PROVISO MIGHT HAVE SOUNDED RATHER SATIRICALLY IN WILLS EAR IF HEHAD BEEN IN A MOOD TO CARE ABOUT SUCH SATIRE
 IT REFERRED TO ANUNDERSTANDING ENTERED INTO MANY WEEKS BEFORE WITH THE PROPRIETORS OFTHE PAPER THAT HE SHOULD BE AT LIBERTY ANY DAY HE PLEASED TO HAND OVERTHE MANAGEMENT TO THE SUBEDITOR WHOM HE HAD BEEN TRAINING SINCE HEWISHED FINALLY TO QUIT MIDDLEMARCH
 BUT INDEFINITE VISIONS OF AMBITIONARE WEAK AGAINST THE EASE OF DOING WHAT IS HABITUAL OR BEGUILINGLYAGREEABLE AND WE ALL KNOW THE DIFFICULTY OF CARRYING OUT A RESOLVEWHEN WE SECRETLY LONG THAT IT MAY TURN OUT TO BE UNNECESSARY
 IN SUCHSTATES OF MIND THE MOST INCREDULOUS PERSON HAS A PRIVATE LEANINGTOWARDS MIRACLE IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE HOW OUR WISH COULD BEFULFILLED STILLVERY WONDERFUL THINGS HAVE HAPPENED
 WILL DID NOTCONFESS THIS WEAKNESS TO HIMSELF BUT HE LINGERED
 WHAT WAS THE USE OFGOING TO LONDON AT THAT TIME OF THE YEAR
 THE RUGBY MEN WHO WOULDREMEMBER HIM WERE NOT THERE AND SO FAR AS POLITICAL WRITING WASCONCERNED HE WOULD RATHER FOR A FEW WEEKS GO ON WITH THE PIONEER
 ATTHE PRESENT MOMENT HOWEVER WHEN MR
 BULSTRODE WAS SPEAKING TO HIM HEHAD BOTH A STRENGTHENED RESOLVE TO GO AND AN EQUALLY STRONG RESOLVE NOTTO GO TILL HE HAD ONCE MORE SEEN DOROTHEA
 HENCE HE REPLIED THAT HE HADREASONS FOR DEFERRING HIS DEPARTURE A LITTLE AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO GOTO THE SALE
WILL WAS IN A DEFIANT MOOD HIS CONSCIOUSNESS BEING DEEPLY STUNG WITHTHE THOUGHT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO LOOKED AT HIM PROBABLY KNEW A FACTTANTAMOUNT TO AN ACCUSATION AGAINST HIM AS A FELLOW WITH LOW DESIGNSWHICH WERE TO BE FRUSTRATED BY A DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY
 LIKE MOST PEOPLEWHO ASSERT THEIR FREEDOM WITH REGARD TO CONVENTIONAL DISTINCTION HEWAS PREPARED TO BE SUDDEN AND QUICK AT QUARREL WITH ANY ONE WHO MIGHTHINT THAT HE HAD PERSONAL REASONS FOR THAT ASSERTIONTHAT THERE WASANYTHING IN HIS BLOOD HIS BEARING OR HIS CHARACTER TO WHICH HE GAVETHE MASK OF AN OPINION
 WHEN HE WAS UNDER AN IRRITATING IMPRESSION OFTHIS KIND HE WOULD GO ABOUT FOR DAYS WITH A DEFIANT LOOK THE COLORCHANGING IN HIS TRANSPARENT SKIN AS IF HE WERE ON THE QUI VIVEWATCHING FOR SOMETHING WHICH HE HAD TO DART UPON
THIS EXPRESSION WAS PECULIARLY NOTICEABLE IN HIM AT THE SALE AND THOSEWHO HAD ONLY SEEN HIM IN HIS MOODS OF GENTLE ODDITY OR OF BRIGHTENJOYMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK WITH A CONTRAST
 HE WAS NOT SORRY TOHAVE THIS OCCASION FOR APPEARING IN PUBLIC BEFORE THE MIDDLEMARCHTRIBES OF TOLLER HACKBUTT AND THE REST WHO LOOKED DOWN ON HIM AS ANADVENTURER AND WERE IN A STATE OF BRUTAL IGNORANCE ABOUT DANTEWHOSNEERED AT HIS POLISH BLOOD AND WERE THEMSELVES OF A BREED VERY MUCHIN NEED OF CROSSING
 HE STOOD IN A CONSPICUOUS PLACE NOT FAR FROM THEAUCTIONEER WITH A FOREFINGER IN EACH SIDEPOCKET AND HIS HEAD THROWNBACKWARD NOT CARING TO SPEAK TO ANYBODY THOUGH HE HAD BEEN CORDIALLYWELCOMED AS A CONNOISSURE BY MR
 TRUMBULL WHO WAS ENJOYING THEUTMOST ACTIVITY OF HIS GREAT FACULTIES
AND SURELY AMONG ALL MEN WHOSE VOCATION REQUIRES THEM TO EXHIBIT THEIRPOWERS OF SPEECH THE HAPPIEST IS A PROSPEROUS PROVINCIAL AUCTIONEERKEENLY ALIVE TO HIS OWN JOKES AND SENSIBLE OF HIS ENCYCLOPEDICKNOWLEDGE
 SOME SATURNINE SOURBLOODED PERSONS MIGHT OBJECT TO BECONSTANTLY INSISTING ON THE MERITS OF ALL ARTICLES FROM BOOTJACKS TOBERGHEMS BUT MR
 BORTHROP TRUMBULL HAD A KINDLY LIQUID IN HIS VEINSHE WAS AN ADMIRER BY NATURE AND WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE THE UNIVERSEUNDER HIS HAMMER FEELING THAT IT WOULD GO AT A HIGHER FIGURE FOR HISRECOMMENDATION
MEANWHILE MRS

 BAMBRIDGE WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HORROCK WOULD DO WITH BLASTEDSTUFF ONLY FIT FOR HABERDASHERS GIVEN OVER TO THAT STATE OF PERDITIONWHICH THE HORSEDEALER SO CORDIALLY RECOGNIZED IN THE MAJORITY OFEARTHLY EXISTENCES
 THE LOT WAS FINALLY KNOCKED DOWN AT A GUINEA TO MR

NOW GENTLEMEN YOU WHO ARE CONNOISSURES YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE ATREAT
 HERE IS AN ENGRAVING OF THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON SURROUNDED BY HISSTAFF ON THE FIELD OF WATERLOO AND NOTWITHSTANDING RECENT EVENTS WHICHHAVE AS IT WERE ENVELOPED OUR GREAT HERO IN A CLOUD I WILL BE BOLDTO SAYFOR A MAN IN MY LINE MUST NOT BE BLOWN ABOUT BY POLITICALWINDSTHAT A FINER SUBJECTOF THE MODERN ORDER BELONGING TO OUR OWNTIME AND EPOCHTHE UNDERSTANDING OF MAN COULD HARDLY CONCEIVE ANGELSMIGHT PERHAPS BUT NOT MEN SIRS NOT MEN
WHO PAINTED IT
 SAID MR
 POWDERELL MUCH IMPRESSED
IT IS A PROOF BEFORE THE LETTER MR
 POWDERELLTHE PAINTER IS NOTKNOWN ANSWERED TRUMBULL WITH A CERTAIN GASPINGNESS IN HIS LASTWORDS AFTER WHICH HE PURSED UP HIS LIPS AND STARED ROUND HIM
ILL BID A POUND
 SAID MR
 POWDERELL IN A TONE OF RESOLVED EMOTIONAS OF A MAN READY TO PUT HIMSELF IN THE BREACH
 WHETHER FROM AWE ORPITY NOBODY RAISED THE PRICE ON HIM
NEXT CAME TWO DUTCH PRINTS WHICH MR
 TOLLER HAD BEEN EAGER FOR ANDAFTER HE HAD SECURED THEM HE WENT AWAY
 OTHER PRINTS AND AFTERWARDSSOME PAINTINGS WERE SOLD TO LEADING MIDDLEMARCHERS WHO HAD COME WITH ASPECIAL DESIRE FOR THEM AND THERE WAS A MORE ACTIVE MOVEMENT OF THEAUDIENCE IN AND OUT SOME WHO HAD BOUGHT WHAT THEY WANTED GOING AWAYOTHERS COMING IN EITHER QUITE NEWLY OR FROM A TEMPORARY VISIT TO THEREFRESHMENTS WHICH WERE SPREAD UNDER THE MARQUEE ON THE LAWN
 IT WASTHIS MARQUEE THAT MR
 BAMBRIDGE WAS BENT ON BUYING AND HE APPEARED TOLIKE LOOKING INSIDE IT FREQUENTLY AS A FORETASTE OF ITS POSSESSION
 ONTHE LAST OCCASION OF HIS RETURN FROM IT HE WAS OBSERVED TO BRING WITHHIM A NEW COMPANION A STRANGER TO MR
 TRUMBULL AND EVERY ONE ELSEWHOSE APPEARANCE HOWEVER LED TO THE SUPPOSITION THAT HE MIGHT BE ARELATIVE OF THE HORSEDEALERSALSO GIVEN TO INDULGENCE
 HIS LARGEWHISKERS IMPOSING SWAGGER AND SWING OF THE LEG MADE HIM A STRIKINGFIGURE BUT HIS SUIT OF BLACK RATHER SHABBY AT THE EDGES CAUSED THEPREJUDICIAL INFERENCE THAT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO AFFORD HIMSELF AS MUCHINDULGENCE AS HE LIKED
WHO IS IT YOUVE PICKED UP BAM
 SAID MR
 HORROCK ASIDE
ASK HIM YOURSELF RETURNED MR
 BAMBRIDGE
 HE SAID HED JUST TURNEDIN FROM THE ROAD
MR
 HORROCK EYED THE STRANGER WHO WAS LEANING BACK AGAINST HIS STICKWITH ONE HAND USING HIS TOOTHPICK WITH THE OTHER AND LOOKING ABOUTHIM WITH A CERTAIN RESTLESSNESS APPARENTLY UNDER THE SILENCE IMPOSED ONHIM BY CIRCUMSTANCES
AT LENGTH THE SUPPER AT EMMAUS WAS BROUGHT FORWARD TO WILLS IMMENSERELIEF FOR HE WAS GETTING SO TIRED OF THE PROCEEDINGS THAT HE HADDRAWN BACK A LITTLE AND LEANED HIS SHOULDER AGAINST THE WALL JUSTBEHIND THE AUCTIONEER
 HE NOW CAME FORWARD AGAIN AND HIS EYE CAUGHTTHE CONSPICUOUS STRANGER WHO RATHER TO HIS SURPRISE WAS STARING ATHIM MARKEDLY
 BUT WILL WAS IMMEDIATELY APPEALED TO BY MR
 TRUMBULL
YES MR
 LADISLAW YES THIS INTERESTS YOU AS A CONNOISSURE ITHINK
 IT IS SOME PLEASURE THE AUCTIONEER WENT ON WITH A RISINGFERVOR TO HAVE A PICTURE LIKE THIS TO SHOW TO A COMPANY OF LADIES ANDGENTLEMENA PICTURE WORTH ANY SUM TO AN INDIVIDUAL WHOSE MEANS WERE ONA LEVEL WITH HIS JUDGMENT
 IT IS A PAINTING OF THE ITALIAN SCHOOLBYTHE CELEBRATED GUYDO THE GREATEST PAINTER IN THE WORLD THE CHIEF OFTHE OLD MASTERS AS THEY ARE CALLEDI TAKE IT BECAUSE THEY WERE UP TOA THING OR TWO BEYOND MOST OF USIN POSSESSION OF SECRETS NOW LOST TOTHE BULK OF MANKIND
 LET ME TELL YOU GENTLEMEN I HAVE SEEN A GREATMANY PICTURES BY THE OLD MASTERS AND THEY ARE NOT ALL UP TO THISMARKSOME OF THEM ARE DARKER THAN YOU MIGHT LIKE AND NOT FAMILYSUBJECTS
 BUT HERE IS A GUYDOTHE FRAME ALONE IS WORTH POUNDSWHICHANY LADY MIGHT BE PROUD TO HANG UPA SUITABLE THING FOR WHAT WE CALL AREFECTORY IN A CHARITABLE INSTITUTION IF ANY GENTLEMAN OF THECORPORATION WISHED TO SHOW HIS MUNIFICENCE
 TURN IT A LITTLE SIR
YES
 JOSEPH TURN IT A LITTLE TOWARDS MR
 LADISLAWMR
 LADISLAW HAVINGBEEN ABROAD UNDERSTANDS THE MERIT OF THESE THINGS YOU OBSERVE
ALL EYES WERE FOR A MOMENT TURNED TOWARDS WILL WHO SAID COOLLY FIVEPOUNDS
 THE AUCTIONEER BURST OUT IN DEEP REMONSTRANCE
AH
 MR
 LADISLAW
 THE FRAME ALONE IS WORTH THAT
 LADIES AND GENTLEMENFOR THE CREDIT OF THE TOWN
 SUPPOSE IT SHOULD BE DISCOVERED HEREAFTERTHAT A GEM OF ART HAS BEEN AMONGST US IN THIS TOWN AND NOBODY INMIDDLEMARCH AWAKE TO IT
 FIVE GUINEASFIVE SEVENSIXFIVE TEN
 STILLLADIES STILL
 IT IS A GEM AND FULL MANY A GEM AS THE POET SAYSHAS BEEN ALLOWED TO GO AT A NOMINAL PRICE BECAUSE THE PUBLIC KNEW NOBETTER BECAUSE IT WAS OFFERED IN CIRCLES WHERE THERE WASI WAS GOINGTO SAY A LOW FEELING BUT NO
SIX POUNDSSIX GUINEASA GUYDO OF THEFIRST ORDER GOING AT SIX GUINEASIT IS AN INSULT TO RELIGION LADIESIT TOUCHES US ALL AS CHRISTIANS GENTLEMEN THAT A SUBJECT LIKE THISSHOULD GO AT SUCH A LOW FIGURESIX POUNDS TENSEVENTHE BIDDING WAS BRISK AND WILL CONTINUED TO SHARE IN IT REMEMBERINGTHAT MRS
 BULSTRODE HAD A STRONG WISH FOR THE PICTURE AND THINKINGTHAT HE MIGHT STRETCH THE PRICE TO TWELVE POUNDS
 BUT IT WAS KNOCKEDDOWN TO HIM AT TEN GUINEAS WHEREUPON HE PUSHED HIS WAY TOWARDS THEBOWWINDOW AND WENT OUT
 HE CHOSE TO GO UNDER THE MARQUEE TO GET AGLASS OF WATER BEING HOT AND THIRSTY IT WAS EMPTY OF OTHER VISITORSAND HE ASKED THE WOMAN IN ATTENDANCE TO FETCH HIM SOME FRESH WATER BUTBEFORE SHE WAS WELL GONE HE WAS ANNOYED TO SEE ENTERING THE FLORIDSTRANGER WHO HAD STARED AT HIM
 IT STRUCK WILL AT THIS MOMENT THAT THEMAN MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE POLITICAL PARASITIC INSECTS OF THE BLOATEDKIND WHO HAD ONCE OR TWICE CLAIMED ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM AS HAVINGHEARD HIM SPEAK ON THE REFORM QUESTION AND WHO MIGHT THINK OF GETTINGA SHILLING BY NEWS
 IN THIS LIGHT HIS PERSON ALREADY RATHER HEATING TOBEHOLD ON A SUMMERS DAY APPEARED THE MORE DISAGREEABLE AND WILLHALFSEATED ON THE ELBOW OF A GARDENCHAIR TURNED HIS EYES CAREFULLYAWAY FROM THE COMER
 BUT THIS SIGNIFIED LITTLE TO OUR ACQUAINTANCE MR
RAFFLES WHO NEVER HESITATED TO THRUST HIMSELF ON UNWILLINGOBSERVATION IF IT SUITED HIS PURPOSE TO DO SO
 HE MOVED A STEP OR TWOTILL HE WAS IN FRONT OF WILL AND SAID WITH FULLMOUTHED HASTE EXCUSEME MR
 LADISLAWWAS YOUR MOTHERS NAME SARAH DUNKIRK
WILL STARTING TO HIS FEET MOVED BACKWARD A STEP FROWNING AND SAYINGWITH SOME FIERCENESS YES SIR IT WAS
 AND WHAT IS THAT TO YOU
IT WAS IN WILLS NATURE THAT THE FIRST SPARK IT THREW OUT WAS A DIRECTANSWER OF THE QUESTION AND A CHALLENGE OF THE CONSEQUENCES
 TO HAVESAID WHAT IS THAT TO YOU
 IN THE FIRST INSTANCE WOULD HAVE SEEMEDLIKE SHUFFLINGAS IF HE MINDED WHO KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HIS ORIGIN
RAFFLES ON HIS SIDE HAD NOT THE SAME EAGERNESS FOR A COLLISION WHICHWAS IMPLIED IN LADISLAWS THREATENING AIR
 THE SLIM YOUNG FELLOW WITHHIS GIRLS COMPLEXION LOOKED LIKE A TIGERCAT READY TO SPRING ON HIM
UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES MR
 RAFFLESS PLEASURE IN ANNOYING HIS COMPANYWAS KEPT IN ABEYANCE
NO OFFENCE MY GOOD SIR NO OFFENCE
 I ONLY REMEMBER YOUR MOTHERKNEWHER WHEN SHE WAS A GIRL
 BUT IT IS YOUR FATHER THAT YOU FEATURE SIR
 IHAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOUR FATHER TOO
 PARENTS ALIVE MR
LADISLAW
NO
 THUNDERED WILL IN THE SAME ATTITUDE AS BEFORE
SHOULD BE GLAD TO DO YOU A SERVICE MR
 LADISLAWBY JOVE I SHOULD
HOPE TO MEET AGAIN
HEREUPON RAFFLES WHO HAD LIFTED HIS HAT WITH THE LAST WORDS TURNEDHIMSELF ROUND WITH A SWING OF HIS LEG AND WALKED AWAY
 WILL LOOKEDAFTER HIM A MOMENT AND COULD SEE THAT HE DID NOT REENTER THEAUCTIONROOM BUT APPEARED TO BE WALKING TOWARDS THE ROAD
 FOR ANINSTANT HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BEEN FOOLISH NOT TO LET THE MAN GO ONTALKINGBUT NO
 ON THE WHOLE HE PREFERRED DOING WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE FROMTHAT SOURCE
LATER IN THE EVENING HOWEVER RAFFLES OVERTOOK HIM IN THE STREET ANDAPPEARING EITHER TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THE ROUGHNESS OF HIS FORMERRECEPTION OR TO INTEND AVENGING IT BY A FORGIVING FAMILIARITY GREETEDHIM JOVIALLY AND WALKED BY HIS SIDE REMARKING AT FIRST ON THEPLEASANTNESS OF THE TOWN AND NEIGHBORHOOD
 WILL SUSPECTED THAT THE MANHAD BEEN DRINKING AND WAS CONSIDERING HOW TO SHAKE HIM OFF WHEN RAFFLESSAIDIVE BEEN ABROAD MYSELF MR
 LADISLAWIVE SEEN THE WORLDUSED TOPARLEYVOUS A LITTLE
 IT WAS AT BOULOGNE I SAW YOUR FATHERA MOSTUNCOMMON LIKENESS YOU ARE OF HIM BY JOVE
 MOUTHNOSEEYESHAIR TURNEDOFF YOUR BROW JUST LIKE HISA LITTLE IN THE FOREIGN STYLE
 JOHN BULLDOESNT DO MUCH OF THAT
 BUT YOUR FATHER WAS VERY ILL WHEN I SAW HIM
LORD LORD
 HANDS YOU MIGHT SEE THROUGH
 YOU WERE A SMALL YOUNGSTERTHEN
 DID HE GET WELL
NO SAID WILL CURTLY
AH
 WELL
 IVE OFTEN WONDERED WHAT BECAME OF YOUR MOTHER
 SHE RAN AWAYFROM HER FRIENDS WHEN SHE WAS A YOUNG LASSA PROUDSPIRITED LASS ANDPRETTY BY JOVE
 I KNEW THE REASON WHY SHE RAN AWAY SAID RAFFLESWINKING SLOWLY AS HE LOOKED SIDEWAYS AT WILL
YOU KNOW NOTHING DISHONORABLE OF HER SIR SAID WILL TURNING ON HIMRATHER SAVAGELY
 BUT MR
 RAFFLES JUST NOW WAS NOT SENSITIVE TO SHADESOF MANNER
NOT A BIT
 SAID HE TOSSING HIS HEAD DECISIVELY
 SHE WAS A LITTLETOO HONORABLE TO LIKE HER FRIENDSTHAT WAS IT
 HERE RAFFLES AGAINWINKED SLOWLY
 LORD BLESS YOU I KNEW ALL ABOUT EMA LITTLE IN WHATYOU MAY CALL THE RESPECTABLE THIEVING LINETHE HIGH STYLE OFRECEIVINGHOUSENONE OF YOUR HOLES AND CORNERSFIRSTRATE
 SLAPUPSHOP HIGH PROFITS AND NO MISTAKE
 BUT LORD
 SARAH WOULD HAVE KNOWNNOTHING ABOUT ITA DASHING YOUNG LADY SHE WASFINE BOARDINGSCHOOLFITFOR A LORDS WIFEONLY ARCHIE DUNCAN THREW IT AT HER OUT OF SPITEBECAUSE SHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM
 AND SO SHE RAN AWAY FROMTHE WHOLE CONCERN
 I TRAVELLED FOR EM SIR IN A GENTLEMANLY WAYAT AHIGH SALARY
 THEY DIDNT MIND HER RUNNING AWAY AT FIRSTGODLY FOLKSSIR VERY GODLYAND SHE WAS FOR THE STAGE
 THE SON WAS ALIVE THEN ANDTHE DAUGHTER WAS AT A DISCOUNT
 HALLO
 HERE WE ARE AT THE BLUE BULL
WHAT DO YOU SAY MR
 LADISLAW
SHALL WE TURN IN AND HAVE A GLASS
NO I MUST SAY GOOD EVENING SAID WILL DASHING UP A PASSAGE WHICHLED INTO LOWICK GATE AND ALMOST RUNNING TO GET OUT OF RAFFLESS REACH
HE WALKED A LONG WHILE ON THE LOWICK ROAD AWAY FROM THE TOWN GLAD OFTHE STARLIT DARKNESS WHEN IT CAME
 HE FELT AS IF HE HAD HAD DIRT CASTON HIM AMIDST SHOUTS OF SCORN
 THERE WAS THIS TO CONFIRM THE FELLOWSSTATEMENTTHAT HIS MOTHER NEVER WOULD TELL HIM THE REASON WHY SHE HADRUN AWAY FROM HER FAMILY
WELL
 WHAT WAS HE WILL LADISLAW THE WORSE SUPPOSING THE TRUTH ABOUTTHAT FAMILY TO BE THE UGLIEST
 HIS MOTHER HAD BRAVED HARDSHIP IN ORDERTO SEPARATE HERSELF FROM IT
 BUT IF DOROTHEAS FRIENDS HAD KNOWN THISSTORYIF THE CHETTAMS HAD KNOWN ITTHEY WOULD HAVE HAD A FINE COLOR TOGIVE THEIR SUSPICIONS A WELCOME GROUND FOR THINKING HIM UNFIT TO COMENEAR HER
 HOWEVER LET THEM SUSPECT WHAT THEY PLEASED THEY WOULD FINDTHEMSELVES IN THE WRONG
 THEY WOULD FIND OUT THAT THE BLOOD IN HISVEINS WAS AS FREE FROM THE TAINT OF MEANNESS AS THEIRS
CHAPTER LXI
INCONSISTENCIES ANSWERED IMLAC CANNOT BOTH BE RIGHT BUT IMPUTEDTO MAN THEY MAY BOTH BE TRUE
RASSELAS
THE SAME NIGHT WHEN MR
 BULSTRODE RETURNED FROM A JOURNEY TO BRASSINGON BUSINESS HIS GOOD WIFE MET HIM IN THE ENTRANCEHALL AND DREW HIMINTO HIS PRIVATE SITTINGROOM
NICHOLAS SHE SAID FIXING HER HONEST EYES UPON HIM ANXIOUSLY THEREHAS BEEN SUCH A DISAGREEABLE MAN HERE ASKING FOR YOUIT HAS MADE MEQUITE UNCOMFORTABLE
WHAT KIND OF MAN MY DEAR SAID MR
 BULSTRODE DREADFULLY CERTAIN OFTHE ANSWER
A REDFACED MAN WITH LARGE WHISKERS AND MOST IMPUDENT IN HIS MANNER
HE DECLARED HE WAS AN OLD FRIEND OF YOURS AND SAID YOU WOULD BE SORRYNOT TO SEE HIM
 HE WANTED TO WAIT FOR YOU HERE BUT I TOLD HIM HE COULDSEE YOU AT THE BANK TOMORROW MORNING
 MOST IMPUDENT HE WAS
STARED ATME AND SAID HIS FRIEND NICK HAD LUCK IN WIVES
 I DONT BELIEVE HEWOULD HAVE GONE AWAY IF BLUCHER HAD NOT HAPPENED TO BREAK HIS CHAINAND COME RUNNING ROUND ON THE GRAVELFOR I WAS IN THE GARDEN SO ISAID YOUD BETTER GO AWAYTHE DOG IS VERY FIERCE AND I CANT HOLDHIM
 DO YOU REALLY KNOW ANYTHING OF SUCH A MAN
I BELIEVE I KNOW WHO HE IS MY DEAR SAID MR
 BULSTRODE IN HIS USUALSUBDUED VOICE AN UNFORTUNATE DISSOLUTE WRETCH WHOM I HELPED TOO MUCHIN DAYS GONE BY
 HOWEVER I PRESUME YOU WILL NOT BE TROUBLED BY HIMAGAIN
 HE WILL PROBABLY COME TO THE BANKTO BEG DOUBTLESS
NO MORE WAS SAID ON THE SUBJECT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN MR
 BULSTRODEHAD RETURNED FROM THE TOWN AND WAS DRESSING FOR DINNER
 HIS WIFE NOTSURE THAT HE WAS COME HOME LOOKED INTO HIS DRESSINGROOM AND SAW HIMWITH HIS COAT AND CRAVAT OFF LEANING ONE ARM ON A CHEST OF DRAWERS ANDSTARING ABSENTLY AT THE GROUND
 HE STARTED NERVOUSLY AND LOOKED UP ASSHE ENTERED
YOU LOOK VERY ILL NICHOLAS
 IS THERE ANYTHING THE MATTER
I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF PAIN IN MY HEAD SAID MR
 BULSTRODE WHO WAS SOFREQUENTLY AILING THAT HIS WIFE WAS ALWAYS READY TO BELIEVE IN THISCAUSE OF DEPRESSION
SIT DOWN AND LET ME SPONGE IT WITH VINEGAR
PHYSICALLY MR
 BULSTRODE DID NOT WANT THE VINEGAR BUT MORALLY THEAFFECTIONATE ATTENTION SOOTHED HIM
 THOUGH ALWAYS POLITE IT WAS HISHABIT TO RECEIVE SUCH SERVICES WITH MARITAL COOLNESS AS HIS WIFESDUTY
 BUT TODAY WHILE SHE WAS BENDING OVER HIM HE SAID YOU AREVERY GOOD HARRIET IN A TONE WHICH HAD SOMETHING NEW IN IT TO HEREAR SHE DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE NOVELTY WAS BUT HER WOMANSSOLICITUDE SHAPED ITSELF INTO A DARTING THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT BE GOINGTO HAVE AN ILLNESS
HAS ANYTHING WORRIED YOU
 SHE SAID
 DID THAT MAN COME TO YOU AT THEBANK
YES IT WAS AS I HAD SUPPOSED
 HE IS A MAN WHO AT ONE TIME MIGHT HAVEDONE BETTER
 BUT HE HAS SUNK INTO A DRUNKEN DEBAUCHED CREATURE
IS HE QUITE GONE AWAY
 SAID MRS
 BULSTRODE ANXIOUSLY BUT FORCERTAIN REASONS SHE REFRAINED FROM ADDING IT WAS VERY DISAGREEABLE TOHEAR HIM CALLING HIMSELF A FRIEND OF YOURS
 AT THAT MOMENT SHE WOULDNOT HAVE LIKED TO SAY ANYTHING WHICH IMPLIED HER HABITUAL CONSCIOUSNESSTHAT HER HUSBANDS EARLIER CONNECTIONS WERE NOT QUITE ON A LEVEL WITHHER OWN
 NOT THAT SHE KNEW MUCH ABOUT THEM
 THAT HER HUSBAND HAD ATFIRST BEEN EMPLOYED IN A BANK THAT HE HAD AFTERWARDS ENTERED INTO WHATHE CALLED CITY BUSINESS AND GAINED A FORTUNE BEFORE HE WASTHREEANDTHIRTY THAT HE HAD MARRIED A WIDOW WHO WAS MUCH OLDER THANHIMSELFA DISSENTER AND IN OTHER WAYS PROBABLY OF THAT DISADVANTAGEOUSQUALITY USUALLY PERCEPTIBLE IN A FIRST WIFE IF INQUIRED INTO WITH THEDISPASSIONATE JUDGMENT OF A SECONDWAS ALMOST AS MUCH AS SHE HAD CAREDTO LEARN BEYOND THE GLIMPSES WHICH MR
 BULSTRODES NARRATIVEOCCASIONALLY GAVE OF HIS EARLY BENT TOWARDS RELIGION HIS INCLINATIONTO BE A PREACHER AND HIS ASSOCIATION WITH MISSIONARY AND PHILANTHROPICEFFORTS
 SHE BELIEVED IN HIM AS AN EXCELLENT MAN WHOSE PIETY CARRIED APECULIAR EMINENCE IN BELONGING TO A LAYMAN WHOSE INFLUENCE HAD TURNEDHER OWN MIND TOWARD SERIOUSNESS AND WHOSE SHARE OF PERISHABLE GOOD HADBEEN THE MEANS OF RAISING HER OWN POSITION
 BUT SHE ALSO LIKED TO THINKTHAT IT WAS WELL IN EVERY SENSE FOR MR
 BULSTRODE TO HAVE WON THE HANDOF HARRIET VINCY WHOSE FAMILY WAS UNDENIABLE IN A MIDDLEMARCH LIGHTABETTER LIGHT SURELY THAN ANY THROWN IN LONDON THOROUGHFARES ORDISSENTING CHAPELYARDS
 THE UNREFORMED PROVINCIAL MIND DISTRUSTEDLONDON AND WHILE TRUE RELIGION WAS EVERYWHERE SAVING HONEST MRS
BULSTRODE WAS CONVINCED THAT TO BE SAVED IN THE CHURCH WAS MORERESPECTABLE
 SHE SO MUCH WISHED TO IGNORE TOWARDS OTHERS THAT HERHUSBAND HAD EVER BEEN A LONDON DISSENTER THAT SHE LIKED TO KEEP IT OUTOF SIGHT EVEN IN TALKING TO HIM
 HE WAS QUITE AWARE OF THIS INDEED INSOME RESPECTS HE WAS RATHER AFRAID OF THIS INGENUOUS WIFE WHOSEIMITATIVE PIETY AND NATIVE WORLDLINESS WERE EQUALLY SINCERE WHO HADNOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF AND WHOM HE HAD MARRIED OUT OF A THOROUGHINCLINATION STILL SUBSISTING
 BUT HIS FEARS WERE SUCH AS BELONG TO AMAN WHO CARES TO MAINTAIN HIS RECOGNIZED SUPREMACY THE LOSS OF HIGHCONSIDERATION FROM HIS WIFE AS FROM EVERY ONE ELSE WHO DID NOT CLEARLYHATE HIM OUT OF ENMITY TO THE TRUTH WOULD BE AS THE BEGINNING OF DEATHTO HIM
 WHEN SHE SAIDIS HE QUITE GONE AWAY
OH I TRUST SO HE ANSWERED WITH AN EFFORT TO THROW AS MUCH SOBERUNCONCERN INTO HIS TONE AS POSSIBLE
BUT IN TRUTH MR
 BULSTRODE WAS VERY FAR FROM A STATE OF QUIET TRUST
 INTHE INTERVIEW AT THE BANK RAFFLES HAD MADE IT EVIDENT THAT HISEAGERNESS TO TORMENT WAS ALMOST AS STRONG IN HIM AS ANY OTHER GREED
 HEHAD FRANKLY SAID THAT HE HAD TURNED OUT OF THE WAY TO COME TOMIDDLEMARCH JUST TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND SEE WHETHER THE NEIGHBORHOODWOULD SUIT HIM TO LIVE IN
 HE HAD CERTAINLY HAD A FEW DEBTS TO PAY MORETHAN HE EXPECTED BUT THE TWO HUNDRED POUNDS WERE NOT GONE YET A COOLFIVEANDTWENTY WOULD SUFFICE HIM TO GO AWAY WITH FOR THE PRESENT
 WHATHE HAD WANTED CHIEFLY WAS TO SEE HIS FRIEND NICK AND FAMILY AND KNOWALL ABOUT THE PROSPERITY OF A MAN TO WHOM HE WAS SO MUCH ATTACHED
BYANDBY HE MIGHT COME BACK FOR A LONGER STAY
 THIS TIME RAFFLESDECLINED TO BE SEEN OFF THE PREMISES AS HE EXPRESSED ITDECLINED TOQUIT MIDDLEMARCH UNDER BULSTRODES EYES
 HE MEANT TO GO BY COACH THENEXT DAYIF HE CHOSE
BULSTRODE FELT HIMSELF HELPLESS
 NEITHER THREATS NOR COAXING COULDAVAIL HE COULD NOT COUNT ON ANY PERSISTENT FEAR NOR ON ANY PROMISE
 ONTHE CONTRARY HE FELT A COLD CERTAINTY AT HIS HEART THAT RAFFLESUNLESSPROVIDENCE SENT DEATH TO HINDER HIMWOULD COME BACK TO MIDDLEMARCHBEFORE LONG
 AND THAT CERTAINTY WAS A TERROR
IT WAS NOT THAT HE WAS IN DANGER OF LEGAL PUNISHMENT OR OF BEGGARY HEWAS IN DANGER ONLY OF SEEING DISCLOSED TO THE JUDGMENT OF HIS NEIGHBORSAND THE MOURNFUL PERCEPTION OF HIS WIFE CERTAIN FACTS OF HIS PAST LIFEWHICH WOULD RENDER HIM AN OBJECT OF SCORN AND AN OPPROBRIUM OF THERELIGION WITH WHICH HE HAD DILIGENTLY ASSOCIATED HIMSELF
 THE TERROR OFBEING JUDGED SHARPENS THE MEMORY IT SENDS AN INEVITABLE GLARE OVERTHAT LONGUNVISITED PAST WHICH HAS BEEN HABITUALLY RECALLED ONLY INGENERAL PHRASES
 EVEN WITHOUT MEMORY THE LIFE IS BOUND INTO ONE BY AZONE OF DEPENDENCE IN GROWTH AND DECAY BUT INTENSE MEMORY FORCES A MANTO OWN HIS BLAMEWORTHY PAST
 WITH MEMORY SET SMARTING LIKE A REOPENEDWOUND A MANS PAST IS NOT SIMPLY A DEAD HISTORY AN OUTWORNPREPARATION OF THE PRESENT IT IS NOT A REPENTED ERROR SHAKEN LOOSEFROM THE LIFE IT IS A STILL QUIVERING PART OF HIMSELF BRINGINGSHUDDERS AND BITTER FLAVORS AND THE TINGLINGS OF A MERITED SHAME
INTO THIS SECOND LIFE BULSTRODES PAST HAD NOW RISEN ONLY THEPLEASURES OF IT SEEMING TO HAVE LOST THEIR QUALITY
 NIGHT AND DAYWITHOUT INTERRUPTION SAVE OF BRIEF SLEEP WHICH ONLY WOVE RETROSPECT ANDFEAR INTO A FANTASTIC PRESENT HE FELT THE SCENES OF HIS EARLIER LIFECOMING BETWEEN HIM AND EVERYTHING ELSE AS OBSTINATELY AS WHEN WE LOOKTHROUGH THE WINDOW FROM A LIGHTED ROOM THE OBJECTS WE TURN OUR BACKSON ARE STILL BEFORE US INSTEAD OF THE GRASS AND THE TREES
 THESUCCESSIVE EVENTS INWARD AND OUTWARD WERE THERE IN ONE VIEW THOUGHEACH MIGHT BE DWELT ON IN TURN THE REST STILL KEPT THEIR HOLD IN THECONSCIOUSNESS
ONCE MORE HE SAW HIMSELF THE YOUNG BANKERS CLERK WITH AN AGREEABLEPERSON AS CLEVER IN FIGURES AS HE WAS FLUENT IN SPEECH AND FOND OFTHEOLOGICAL DEFINITION AN EMINENT THOUGH YOUNG MEMBER OF A CALVINISTICDISSENTING CHURCH AT HIGHBURY HAVING HAD STRIKING EXPERIENCE INCONVICTION OF SIN AND SENSE OF PARDON
 AGAIN HE HEARD HIMSELF CALLEDFOR AS BROTHER BULSTRODE IN PRAYER MEETINGS SPEAKING ON RELIGIOUSPLATFORMS PREACHING IN PRIVATE HOUSES
 AGAIN HE FELT HIMSELF THINKINGOF THE MINISTRY AS POSSIBLY HIS VOCATION AND INCLINED TOWARDSMISSIONARY LABOR
 THAT WAS THE HAPPIEST TIME OF HIS LIFE THAT WAS THESPOT HE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN NOW TO AWAKE IN AND FIND THE REST A DREAM
THE PEOPLE AMONG WHOM BROTHER BULSTRODE WAS DISTINGUISHED WERE VERYFEW BUT THEY WERE VERY NEAR TO HIM AND STIRRED HIS SATISFACTION THEMORE HIS POWER STRETCHED THROUGH A NARROW SPACE BUT HE FELT ITSEFFECT THE MORE INTENSELY
 HE BELIEVED WITHOUT EFFORT IN THE PECULIARWORK OF GRACE WITHIN HIM AND IN THE SIGNS THAT GOD INTENDED HIM FORSPECIAL INSTRUMENTALITY
THEN CAME THE MOMENT OF TRANSITION IT WAS WITH THE SENSE OF PROMOTIONHE HAD WHEN HE AN ORPHAN EDUCATED AT A COMMERCIAL CHARITYSCHOOL WASINVITED TO A FINE VILLA BELONGING TO MR
 DUNKIRK THE RICHEST MAN INTHE CONGREGATION
 SOON HE BECAME AN INTIMATE THERE HONORED FOR HISPIETY BY THE WIFE MARKED OUT FOR HIS ABILITY BY THE HUSBAND WHOSEWEALTH WAS DUE TO A FLOURISHING CITY AND WESTEND TRADE
 THAT WAS THESETTINGIN OF A NEW CURRENT FOR HIS AMBITION DIRECTING HIS PROSPECTSOF INSTRUMENTALITY TOWARDS THE UNITING OF DISTINGUISHED RELIGIOUSGIFTS WITH SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS
BYANDBY CAME A DECIDED EXTERNAL LEADING A CONFIDENTIAL SUBORDINATEPARTNER DIED AND NOBODY SEEMED TO THE PRINCIPAL SO WELL FITTED TO FILLTHE SEVERELY FELT VACANCY AS HIS YOUNG FRIEND BULSTRODE IF HE WOULDBECOME CONFIDENTIAL ACCOUNTANT
 THE OFFER WAS ACCEPTED
 THE BUSINESSWAS A PAWNBROKERS OF THE MOST MAGNIFICENT SORT BOTH IN EXTENT ANDPROFITS AND ON A SHORT ACQUAINTANCE WITH IT BULSTRODE BECAME AWARETHAT ONE SOURCE OF MAGNIFICENT PROFIT WAS THE EASY RECEPTION OF ANYGOODS OFFERED WITHOUT STRICT INQUIRY AS TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM
 BUTTHERE WAS A BRANCH HOUSE AT THE WEST END AND NO PETTINESS OR DINGINESSTO GIVE SUGGESTIONS OF SHAME
HE REMEMBERED HIS FIRST MOMENTS OF SHRINKING
 THEY WERE PRIVATE ANDWERE FILLED WITH ARGUMENTS SOME OF THESE TAKING THE FORM OF PRAYER
THE BUSINESS WAS ESTABLISHED AND HAD OLD ROOTS IS IT NOT ONE THING TOSET UP A NEW GINPALACE AND ANOTHER TO ACCEPT AN INVESTMENT IN AN OLDONE
 THE PROFITS MADE OUT OF LOST SOULSWHERE CAN THE LINE BE DRAWN ATWHICH THEY BEGIN IN HUMAN TRANSACTIONS
 WAS IT NOT EVEN GODS WAY OFSAVING HIS CHOSEN
 THOU KNOWESTTHE YOUNG BULSTRODE HAD SAID THENAS THE OLDER BULSTRODE WAS SAYING NOWTHOU KNOWEST HOW LOOSE MY SOULSITS FROM THESE THINGSHOW I VIEW THEM ALL AS IMPLEMENTS FOR TILLINGTHY GARDEN RESCUED HERE AND THERE FROM THE WILDERNESS
METAPHORS AND PRECEDENTS WERE NOT WANTING PECULIAR SPIRITUALEXPERIENCES WERE NOT WANTING WHICH AT LAST MADE THE RETENTION OF HISPOSITION SEEM A SERVICE DEMANDED OF HIM THE VISTA OF A FORTUNE HADALREADY OPENED ITSELF AND BULSTRODES SHRINKING REMAINED PRIVATE
 MR
DUNKIRK HAD NEVER EXPECTED THAT THERE WOULD BE ANY SHRINKING AT ALL HEHAD NEVER CONCEIVED THAT TRADE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SCHEME OFSALVATION
 AND IT WAS TRUE THAT BULSTRODE FOUND HIMSELF CARRYING ON TWODISTINCT LIVES HIS RELIGIOUS ACTIVITY COULD NOT BE INCOMPATIBLE WITHHIS BUSINESS AS SOON AS HE HAD ARGUED HIMSELF INTO NOT FEELING ITINCOMPATIBLE
MENTALLY SURROUNDED WITH THAT PAST AGAIN BULSTRODE HAD THE SAMEPLEASINDEED THE YEARS HAD BEEN PERPETUALLY SPINNING THEM INTOINTRICATE THICKNESS LIKE MASSES OF SPIDERWEB PADDING THE MORALSENSIBILITY NAY AS AGE MADE EGOISM MORE EAGER BUT LESS ENJOYING HISSOUL HAD BECOME MORE SATURATED WITH THE BELIEF THAT HE DID EVERYTHINGFOR GODS SAKE BEING INDIFFERENT TO IT FOR HIS OWN
 AND YETIF HECOULD BE BACK IN THAT FAROFF SPOT WITH HIS YOUTHFUL POVERTYWHY THENHE WOULD CHOOSE TO BE A MISSIONARY
BUT THE TRAIN OF CAUSES IN WHICH HE HAD LOCKED HIMSELF WENT ON
 THEREWAS TROUBLE IN THE FINE VILLA AT HIGHBURY
 YEARS BEFORE THE ONLYDAUGHTER HAD RUN AWAY DEFIED HER PARENTS AND GONE ON THE STAGE ANDNOW THE ONLY BOY DIED AND AFTER A SHORT TIME MR
 DUNKIRK DIED ALSO
THE WIFE A SIMPLE PIOUS WOMAN LEFT WITH ALL THE WEALTH IN AND OUT OFTHE MAGNIFICENT TRADE OF WHICH SHE NEVER KNEW THE PRECISE NATURE HADCOME TO BELIEVE IN BULSTRODE AND INNOCENTLY ADORE HIM AS WOMEN OFTENADORE THEIR PRIEST OR MANMADE MINISTER
 IT WAS NATURAL THAT AFTER ATIME MARRIAGE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THOUGHT OF BETWEEN THEM
 BUT MRS
DUNKIRK HAD QUALMS AND YEARNINGS ABOUT HER DAUGHTER WHO HAD LONG BEENREGARDED AS LOST BOTH TO GOD AND HER PARENTS
 IT WAS KNOWN THAT THEDAUGHTER HAD MARRIED BUT SHE WAS UTTERLY GONE OUT OF SIGHT
 THEMOTHER HAVING LOST HER BOY IMAGINED A GRANDSON AND WISHED IN ADOUBLE SENSE TO RECLAIM HER DAUGHTER
 IF SHE WERE FOUND THERE WOULD BEA CHANNEL FOR PROPERTYPERHAPS A WIDE ONEIN THE PROVISION FOR SEVERALGRANDCHILDREN
 EFFORTS TO FIND HER MUST BE MADE BEFORE MRS
 DUNKIRKWOULD MARRY AGAIN
 BULSTRODE CONCURRED BUT AFTER ADVERTISEMENT AS WELLAS OTHER MODES OF INQUIRY HAD BEEN TRIED THE MOTHER BELIEVED THAT HERDAUGHTER WAS NOT TO BE FOUND AND CONSENTED TO MARRY WITHOUTRESERVATION OF PROPERTY
THE DAUGHTER HAD BEEN FOUND BUT ONLY ONE MAN BESIDES BULSTRODE KNEWIT AND HE WAS PAID FOR KEEPING SILENCE AND CARRYING HIMSELF AWAY
THAT WAS THE BARE FACT WHICH BULSTRODE WAS NOW FORCED TO SEE IN THERIGID OUTLINE WITH WHICH ACTS PRESENT THEMSELVES TO ONLOOKERS
 BUT FORHIMSELF AT THAT DISTANT TIME AND EVEN NOW IN BURNING MEMORY THE FACTWAS BROKEN INTO LITTLE SEQUENCES EACH JUSTIFIED AS IT CAME BYREASONINGS WHICH SEEMED TO PROVE IT RIGHTEOUS
 BULSTRODES COURSE UP TOTHAT TIME HAD HE THOUGHT BEEN SANCTIONED BY REMARKABLE PROVIDENCESAPPEARING TO POINT THE WAY FOR HIM TO BE THE AGENT IN MAKING THE BESTUSE OF A LARGE PROPERTY AND WITHDRAWING IT FROM PERVERSION
 DEATH ANDOTHER STRIKING DISPOSITIONS SUCH AS FEMININE TRUSTFULNESS HAD COMEAND BULSTRODE WOULD HAVE ADOPTED CROMWELLS WORDSDO YOU CALL THESEBARE EVENTS
 THE LORD PITY YOU
 THE EVENTS WERE COMPARATIVELY SMALLBUT THE ESSENTIAL CONDITION WAS THERENAMELY THAT THEY WERE IN FAVOROF HIS OWN ENDS
 IT WAS EASY FOR HIM TO SETTLE WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM TOOTHERS BY INQUIRING WHAT WERE GODS INTENTIONS WITH REGARD TO HIMSELF
COULD IT BE FOR GODS SERVICE THAT THIS FORTUNE SHOULD IN ANYCONSIDERABLE PROPORTION GO TO A YOUNG WOMAN AND HER HUSBAND WHO WEREGIVEN UP TO THE LIGHTEST PURSUITS AND MIGHT SCATTER IT ABROAD INTRIVIALITYPEOPLE WHO SEEMED TO LIE OUTSIDE THE PATH OF REMARKABLEPROVIDENCES
 BULSTRODE HAD NEVER SAID TO HIMSELF BEFOREHAND THEDAUGHTER SHALL NOT BE FOUNDNEVERTHELESS WHEN THE MOMENT CAME HE KEPTHER EXISTENCE HIDDEN AND WHEN OTHER MOMENTS FOLLOWED HE SOOTHED THEMOTHER WITH CONSOLATION IN THE PROBABILITY THAT THE UNHAPPY YOUNG WOMANMIGHT BE NO MORE
THERE WERE HOURS IN WHICH BULSTRODE FELT THAT HIS ACTION WASUNRIGHTEOUS BUT HOW COULD HE GO BACK
 HE HAD MENTAL EXERCISES CALLEDHIMSELF NOUGHT LAID HOLD ON REDEMPTION AND WENT ON IN HIS COURSE OFINSTRUMENTALITY
 AND AFTER FIVE YEARS DEATH AGAIN CAME TO WIDEN HISPATH BY TAKING AWAY HIS WIFE
 HE DID GRADUALLY WITHDRAW HIS CAPITALBUT HE DID NOT MAKE THE SACRIFICES REQUISITE TO PUT AN END TO THEBUSINESS WHICH WAS CARRIED ON FOR THIRTEEN YEARS AFTERWARDS BEFORE ITFINALLY COLLAPSED
 MEANWHILE NICHOLAS BULSTRODE HAD USED HIS HUNDREDTHOUSAND DISCREETLY AND WAS BECOME PROVINCIALLY SOLIDLY IMPORTANTABANKER A CHURCHMAN A PUBLIC BENEFACTOR ALSO A SLEEPING PARTNER INTRADING CONCERNS IN WHICH HIS ABILITY WAS DIRECTED TO ECONOMY IN THERAW MATERIAL AS IN THE CASE OF THE DYES WHICH ROTTED MR
 VINCYS SILK
AND NOW WHEN THIS RESPECTABILITY HAD LASTED UNDISTURBED FOR NEARLYTHIRTY YEARSWHEN ALL THAT PRECEDED IT HAD LONG LAIN BENUMBED IN THECONSCIOUSNESSTHAT PAST HAD RISEN AND IMMERSED HIS THOUGHT AS IF WITHTHE TERRIBLE IRRUPTION OF A NEW SENSE OVERBURTHENING THE FEEBLE BEING
MEANWHILE IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH RAFFLES HE HAD LEARNED SOMETHINGMOMENTOUS SOMETHING WHICH ENTERED ACTIVELY INTO THE STRUGGLE OF HISLONGINGS AND TERRORS
 THERE HE THOUGHT LAY AN OPENING TOWARDSSPIRITUAL PERHAPS TOWARDS MATERIAL RESCUE
THE SPIRITUAL KIND OF RESCUE WAS A GENUINE NEED WITH HIM
 THERE MAY BECOARSE HYPOCRITES WHO CONSCIOUSLY AFFECT BELIEFS AND EMOTIONS FOR THESAKE OF GULLING THE WORLD BUT BULSTRODE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM
 HE WASSIMPLY A MAN WHOSE DESIRES HAD BEEN STRONGER THAN HIS THEORETICBELIEFS AND WHO HAD GRADUALLY EXPLAINED THE GRATIFICATION OF HISDESIRES INTO SATISFACTORY AGREEMENT WITH THOSE BELIEFS
 IF THIS BEHYPOCRISY IT IS A PROCESS WHICH SHOWS ITSELF OCCASIONALLY IN US ALLTO WHATEVER CONFESSION WE BELONG AND WHETHER WE BELIEVE IN THE FUTUREPERFECTION OF OUR RACE OR IN THE NEAREST DATE FIXED FOR THE END OF THEWORLD WHETHER WE REGARD THE EARTH AS A PUTREFYING NIDUS FOR A SAVEDREMNANT INCLUDING OURSELVES OR HAVE A PASSIONATE BELIEF IN THESOLIDARITY OF MANKIND
THE SERVICE HE COULD DO TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGION HAD BEEN THROUGH LIFETHE GROUND HE ALLEGED TO HIMSELF FOR HIS CHOICE OF ACTION IT HAD BEENTHE MOTIVE WHICH HE HAD POURED OUT IN HIS PRAYERS
 WHO WOULD USE MONEYAND POSITION BETTER THAN HE MEANT TO USE THEM
 WHO COULD SURPASS HIM INSELFABHORRENCE AND EXALTATION OF GODS CAUSE
 AND TO MR
 BULSTRODEGODS CAUSE WAS SOMETHING DISTINCT FROM HIS OWN RECTITUDE OF CONDUCTIT ENFORCED A DISCRIMINATION OF GODS ENEMIES WHO WERE TO BE USEDMERELY AS INSTRUMENTS AND WHOM IT WOULD BE AS WELL IF POSSIBLE TO KEEPOUT OF MONEY AND CONSEQUENT INFLUENCE
 ALSO PROFITABLE INVESTMENTS INTRADES WHERE THE POWER OF THE PRINCE OF THIS WORLD SHOWED ITS MOSTACTIVE DEVICES BECAME SANCTIFIED BY A RIGHT APPLICATION OF THE PROFITSIN THE HANDS OF GODS SERVANT
THIS IMPLICIT REASONING IS ESSENTIALLY NO MORE PECULIAR TO EVANGELICALBELIEF THAN THE USE OF WIDE PHRASES FOR NARROW MOTIVES IS PECULIAR TOENGLISHMEN
 THERE IS NO GENERAL DOCTRINE WHICH IS NOT CAPABLE OF EATINGOUT OUR MORALITY IF UNCHECKED BY THE DEEPSEATED HABIT OF DIRECTFELLOWFEELING WITH INDIVIDUAL FELLOWMEN
BUT A MAN WHO BELIEVES IN SOMETHING ELSE THAN HIS OWN GREED HASNECESSARILY A CONSCIENCE OR STANDARD TO WHICH HE MORE OR LESS ADAPTSHIMSELF
 BULSTRODES STANDARD HAD BEEN HIS SERVICEABLENESS TO GODSCAUSE I AM SINFUL AND NOUGHTA VESSEL TO BE CONSECRATED BY USEBUTUSE ME
HAD BEEN THE MOULD INTO WHICH HE HAD CONSTRAINED HIS IMMENSENEED OF BEING SOMETHING IMPORTANT AND PREDOMINATING
 AND NOW HAD COME AMOMENT IN WHICH THAT MOULD SEEMED IN DANGER OF BEING BROKEN AND UTTERLYCAST AWAY
WHAT IF THE ACTS HE HAD RECONCILED HIMSELF TO BECAUSE THEY MADE HIM ASTRONGER INSTRUMENT OF THE DIVINE GLORY WERE TO BECOME THE PRETEXT OFTHE SCOFFER AND A DARKENING OF THAT GLORY
 IF THIS WERE TO BE THERULING OF PROVIDENCE HE WAS CAST OUT FROM THE TEMPLE AS ONE WHO HADBROUGHT UNCLEAN OFFERINGS
HE HAD LONG POURED OUT UTTERANCES OF REPENTANCE
 BUT TODAY A REPENTANCEHAD COME WHICH WAS OF A BITTERER FLAVOR AND A THREATENING PROVIDENCEURGED HIM TO A KIND OF PROPITIATION WHICH WAS NOT SIMPLY A DOCTRINALTRANSACTION
 THE DIVINE TRIBUNAL HAD CHANGED ITS ASPECT FOR HIMSELFPROSTRATION WAS NO LONGER ENOUGH AND HE MUST BRING RESTITUTION INHIS HAND
 IT WAS REALLY BEFORE HIS GOD THAT BULSTRODE WAS ABOUT TOATTEMPT SUCH RESTITUTION AS SEEMED POSSIBLE A GREAT DREAD HAD SEIZEDHIS SUSCEPTIBLE FRAME AND THE SCORCHING APPROACH OF SHAME WROUGHT INHIM A NEW SPIRITUAL NEED
 NIGHT AND DAY WHILE THE RESURGENTTHREATENING PAST WAS MAKING A CONSCIENCE WITHIN HIM HE WAS THINKING BYWHAT MEANS HE COULD RECOVER PEACE AND TRUSTBY WHAT SACRIFICE HE COULDSTAY THE ROD
 HIS BELIEF IN THESE MOMENTS OF DREAD WAS THAT IF HESPONTANEOUSLY DID SOMETHING RIGHT GOD WOULD SAVE HIM FROM THECONSEQUENCES OF WRONGDOING
 FOR RELIGION CAN ONLY CHANGE WHEN THEEMOTIONS WHICH FILL IT ARE CHANGED AND THE RELIGION OF PERSONAL FEARREMAINS NEARLY AT THE LEVEL OF THE SAVAGE
HE HAD SEEN RAFFLES ACTUALLY GOING AWAY ON THE BRASSING COACH AND THISWAS A TEMPORARY RELIEF IT REMOVED THE PRESSURE OF AN IMMEDIATE DREADBUT DID NOT PUT AN END TO THE SPIRITUAL CONFLICT AND THE NEED TO WINPROTECTION
 AT LAST HE CAME TO A DIFFICULT RESOLVE AND WROTE A LETTERTO WILL LADISLAW BEGGING HIM TO BE AT THE SHRUBS THAT EVENING FOR APRIVATE INTERVIEW AT NINE OCLOCK
 WILL HAD FELT NO PARTICULAR SURPRISEAT THE REQUEST AND CONNECTED IT WITH SOME NEW NOTIONS ABOUT THEPIONEER BUT WHEN HE WAS SHOWN INTO MR
 BULSTRODES PRIVATE ROOM HEWAS STRUCK WITH THE PAINFULLY WORN LOOK ON THE BANKERS FACE AND WASGOING TO SAY ARE YOU ILL
 WHEN CHECKING HIMSELF IN THAT ABRUPTNESSHE ONLY INQUIRED AFTER MRS
 BULSTRODE AND HER SATISFACTION WITH THEPICTURE BOUGHT FOR HER
THANK YOU SHE IS QUITE SATISFIED SHE HAS GONE OUT WITH HER DAUGHTERSTHIS EVENING
 I BEGGED YOU TO COME MR
 LADISLAW BECAUSE I HAVE ACOMMUNICATION OF A VERY PRIVATEINDEED I WILL SAY OF A SACREDLYCONFIDENTIAL NATURE WHICH I DESIRE TO MAKE TO YOU
 NOTHING I DARESAY HAS BEEN FARTHER FROM YOUR THOUGHTS THAN THAT THERE HAD BEENIMPORTANT TIES IN THE PAST WHICH COULD CONNECT YOUR HISTORY WITH MINE
WILL FELT SOMETHING LIKE AN ELECTRIC SHOCK
 HE WAS ALREADY IN A STATEOF KEEN SENSITIVENESS AND HARDLY ALLAYED AGITATION ON THE SUBJECT OFTIES IN THE PAST AND HIS PRESENTIMENTS WERE NOT AGREEABLE
 IT SEEMEDLIKE THE FLUCTUATIONS OF A DREAMAS IF THE ACTION BEGUN BY THAT LOUDBLOATED STRANGER WERE BEING CARRIED ON BY THIS PALEEYED SICKLY LOOKINGPIECE OF RESPECTABILITY WHOSE SUBDUED TONE AND GLIB FORMALITY OFSPEECH WERE AT THIS MOMENT ALMOST AS REPULSIVE TO HIM AS THEIRREMEMBERED CONTRAST
 HE ANSWERED WITH A MARKED CHANGE OF COLORNO INDEED NOTHING
YOU SEE BEFORE YOU MR
 LADISLAW A MAN WHO IS DEEPLY STRICKEN
 BUTFOR THE URGENCY OF CONSCIENCE AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I AM BEFORE THEBAR OF ONE WHO SEETH NOT AS MAN SEETH I SHOULD BE UNDER NO COMPULSIONTO MAKE THE DISCLOSURE WHICH HAS BEEN MY OBJECT IN ASKING YOU TO COMEHERE TONIGHT
 SO FAR AS HUMAN LAWS GO YOU HAVE NO CLAIM ON MEWHATEVER
WILL WAS EVEN MORE UNCOMFORTABLE THAN WONDERING
 MR
 BULSTRODE HADPAUSED LEANING HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND AND LOOKING AT THE FLOOR
 BUT HENOW FIXED HIS EXAMINING GLANCE ON WILL AND SAIDI AM TOLD THAT YOUR MOTHERS NAME WAS SARAH DUNKIRK AND THAT SHE RANAWAY FROM HER FRIENDS TO GO ON THE STAGE
 ALSO THAT YOUR FATHER WAS ATONE TIME MUCH EMACIATED BY ILLNESS
 MAY I ASK IF YOU CAN CONFIRM THESESTATEMENTS
YES THEY ARE ALL TRUE SAID WILL STRUCK WITH THE ORDER IN WHICH ANINQUIRY HAD COME THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO BE PRELIMINARY TOTHE BANKERS PREVIOUS HINTS
 BUT MR
 BULSTRODE HAD TONIGHT FOLLOWEDTHE ORDER OF HIS EMOTIONS HE ENTERTAINED NO DOUBT THAT THE OPPORTUNITYFOR RESTITUTION HAD COME AND HE HAD AN OVERPOWERING IMPULSE TOWARDSTHE PENITENTIAL EXPRESSION BY WHICH HE WAS DEPRECATING CHASTISEMENT
DO YOU KNOW ANY PARTICULARS OF YOUR MOTHERS FAMILY
 HE CONTINUED
NO SHE NEVER LIKED TO SPEAK OF THEM
 SHE WAS A VERY GENEROUSHONORABLE WOMAN SAID WILL ALMOST ANGRILY
I DO NOT WISH TO ALLEGE ANYTHING AGAINST HER
 DID SHE NEVER MENTIONHER MOTHER TO YOU AT ALL
I HAVE HEARD HER SAY THAT SHE THOUGHT HER MOTHER DID NOT KNOW THEREASON OF HER RUNNING AWAY
 SHE SAID POOR MOTHER IN A PITYING TONE
THAT MOTHER BECAME MY WIFE SAID BULSTRODE AND THEN PAUSED A MOMENTBEFORE HE ADDED YOU HAVE A CLAIM ON ME MR
 LADISLAW AS I SAIDBEFORE NOT A LEGAL CLAIM BUT ONE WHICH MY CONSCIENCE RECOGNIZES
 IWAS ENRICHED BY THAT MARRIAGEA RESULT WHICH WOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVETAKEN PLACECERTAINLY NOT TO THE SAME EXTENTIF YOUR GRANDMOTHER COULDHAVE DISCOVERED HER DAUGHTER
 THAT DAUGHTER I GATHER IS NO LONGERLIVING
NO SAID WILL FEELING SUSPICION AND REPUGNANCE RISING SO STRONGLYWITHIN HIM THAT WITHOUT QUITE KNOWING WHAT HE DID HE TOOK HIS HATFROM THE FLOOR AND STOOD UP
 THE IMPULSE WITHIN HIM WAS TO REJECT THEDISCLOSED CONNECTION
PRAY BE SEATED MR
 LADISLAW SAID BULSTRODE ANXIOUSLY
 DOUBTLESSYOU ARE STARTLED BY THE SUDDENNESS OF THIS DISCOVERY
 BUT I ENTREATYOUR PATIENCE WITH ONE WHO IS ALREADY BOWED DOWN BY INWARD TRIAL
WILL RESEATED HIMSELF FEELING SOME PITY WHICH WAS HALF CONTEMPT FORTHIS VOLUNTARY SELFABASEMENT OF AN ELDERLY MAN
IT IS MY WISH MR
 LADISLAW TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE DEPRIVATION WHICHBEFELL YOUR MOTHER
 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE WITHOUT FORTUNE AND I WISH TOSUPPLY YOU ADEQUATELY FROM A STORE WHICH WOULD HAVE PROBABLY ALREADYBEEN YOURS HAD YOUR GRANDMOTHER BEEN CERTAIN OF YOUR MOTHERS EXISTENCEAND BEEN ABLE TO FIND HER
MR
 BULSTRODE PAUSED
 HE FELT THAT HE WAS PERFORMING A STRIKING PIECEOF SCRUPULOSITY IN THE JUDGMENT OF HIS AUDITOR AND A PENITENTIAL ACTIN THE EYES OF GOD
 HE HAD NO CLEW TO THE STATE OF WILL LADISLAWSMIND SMARTING AS IT WAS FROM THE CLEAR HINTS OF RAFFLES AND WITH ITSNATURAL QUICKNESS IN CONSTRUCTION STIMULATED BY THE EXPECTATION OFDISCOVERIES WHICH HE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO CONJURE BACK INTODARKNESS
 WILL MADE NO ANSWER FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS TILL MR
 BULSTRODEWHO AT THE END OF HIS SPEECH HAD CAST HIS EYES ON THE FLOOR NOW RAISEDTHEM WITH AN EXAMINING GLANCE WHICH WILL MET FULLY SAYINGI SUPPOSE YOU DID KNOW OF MY MOTHERS EXISTENCE AND KNEW WHERE SHEMIGHT HAVE BEEN FOUND
BULSTRODE SHRANKTHERE WAS A VISIBLE QUIVERING IN HIS FACE AND HANDS
HE WAS TOTALLY UNPREPARED TO HAVE HIS ADVANCES MET IN THIS WAY OR TOFIND HIMSELF URGED INTO MORE REVELATION THAN HE HAD BEFOREHAND SET DOWNAS NEEDFUL
 BUT AT THAT MOMENT HE DARED NOT TELL A LIE AND HE FELTSUDDENLY UNCERTAIN OF HIS GROUND WHICH HE HAD TRODDEN WITH SOMECONFIDENCE BEFORE
I WILL NOT DENY THAT YOU CONJECTURE RIGHTLY HE ANSWERED WITH AFALTERING IN HIS TONE
 AND I WISH TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO YOU AS THE ONESTILL REMAINING WHO HAS SUFFERED A LOSS THROUGH ME
 YOU ENTER I TRUSTINTO MY PURPOSE MR
 LADISLAW WHICH HAS A REFERENCE TO HIGHER THANMERELY HUMAN CLAIMS AND AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID IS ENTIRELYINDEPENDENT OF ANY LEGAL COMPULSION
 I AM READY TO NARROW MY OWNRESOURCES AND THE PROSPECTS OF MY FAMILY BY BINDING MYSELF TO ALLOW YOUFIVE HUNDRED POUNDS YEARLY DURING MY LIFE AND TO LEAVE YOU APROPORTIONAL CAPITAL AT MY DEATHNAY TO DO STILL MORE IF MORE SHOULDBE DEFINITELY NECESSARY TO ANY LAUDABLE PROJECT ON YOUR PART
 MR
BULSTRODE HAD GONE ON TO PARTICULARS IN THE EXPECTATION THAT THESEWOULD WORK STRONGLY ON LADISLAW AND MERGE OTHER FEELINGS IN GRATEFULACCEPTANCE
BUT WILL WAS LOOKING AS STUBBORN AS POSSIBLE WITH HIS LIP POUTING ANDHIS FINGERS IN HIS SIDEPOCKETS
 HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST TOUCHED ANDSAID FIRMLYBEFORE I MAKE ANY REPLY TO YOUR PROPOSITION MR
 BULSTRODE I MUST BEGYOU TO ANSWER A QUESTION OR TWO
 WERE YOU CONNECTED WITH THE BUSINESSBY WHICH THAT FORTUNE YOU SPEAK OF WAS ORIGINALLY MADE
MR
 BULSTRODES THOUGHT WAS RAFFLES HAS TOLD HIM
 HOW COULD HEREFUSE TO ANSWER WHEN HE HAD VOLUNTEERED WHAT DREW FORTH THE QUESTION
HE ANSWERED YES
AND WAS THAT BUSINESSOR WAS IT NOTA THOROUGHLY DISHONORABLE ONENAYONE THAT IF ITS NATURE HAD BEEN MADE PUBLIC MIGHT HAVE RANKED THOSECONCERNED IN IT WITH THIEVES AND CONVICTS
WILLS TONE HAD A CUTTING BITTERNESS HE WAS MOVED TO PUT HIS QUESTIONAS NAKEDLY AS HE COULD
BULSTRODE REDDENED WITH IRREPRESSIBLE ANGER
 HE HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR ASCENE OF SELFABASEMENT BUT HIS INTENSE PRIDE AND HIS HABIT OFSUPREMACY OVERPOWERED PENITENCE AND EVEN DREAD WHEN THIS YOUNG MANWHOM HE HAD MEANT TO BENEFIT TURNED ON HIM WITH THE AIR OF A JUDGE
THE BUSINESS WAS ESTABLISHED BEFORE I BECAME CONNECTED WITH IT SIRNOR IS IT FOR YOU TO INSTITUTE AN INQUIRY OF THAT KIND HE ANSWEREDNOT RAISING HIS VOICE BUT SPEAKING WITH QUICK DEFIANTNESS
YES IT IS SAID WILL STARTING UP AGAIN WITH HIS HAT IN HIS HAND
IT IS EMINENTLY MINE TO ASK SUCH QUESTIONS WHEN I HAVE TO DECIDEWHETHER I WILL HAVE TRANSACTIONS WITH YOU AND ACCEPT YOUR MONEY
 MYUNBLEMISHED HONOR IS IMPORTANT TO ME
 IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME TO HAVE NOSTAIN ON MY BIRTH AND CONNECTIONS
 AND NOW I FIND THERE IS A STAINWHICH I CANT HELP
 MY MOTHER FELT IT AND TRIED TO KEEP AS CLEAR OF ITAS SHE COULD AND SO WILL I
 YOU SHALL KEEP YOUR ILLGOTTEN MONEY
 IF IHAD ANY FORTUNE OF MY OWN I WOULD WILLINGLY PAY IT TO ANY ONE WHOCOULD DISPROVE WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME
 WHAT I HAVE TO THANK YOU FOR ISTHAT YOU KEPT THE MONEY TILL NOW WHEN I CAN REFUSE IT
 IT OUGHT TO LIEWITH A MANS SELF THAT HE IS A GENTLEMAN
 GOODNIGHT SIR
BULSTRODE WAS GOING TO SPEAK BUT WILL WITH DETERMINED QUICKNESS WASOUT OF THE ROOM IN AN INSTANT AND IN ANOTHER THE HALLDOOR HAD CLOSEDBEHIND HIM
 HE WAS TOO STRONGLY POSSESSED WITH PASSIONATE REBELLIONAGAINST THIS INHERITED BLOT WHICH HAD BEEN THRUST ON HIS KNOWLEDGE TOREFLECT AT PRESENT WHETHER HE HAD NOT BEEN TOO HARD ON BULSTRODETOOARROGANTLY MERCILESS TOWARDS A MAN OF SIXTY WHO WAS MAKING EFFORTS ATRETRIEVAL WHEN TIME HAD RENDERED THEM VAIN
NO THIRD PERSON LISTENING COULD HAVE THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD THEIMPETUOSITY OF WILLS REPULSE OR THE BITTERNESS OF HIS WORDS
 NO ONEBUT HIMSELF THEN KNEW HOW EVERYTHING CONNECTED WITH THE SENTIMENT OFHIS OWN DIGNITY HAD AN IMMEDIATE BEARING FOR HIM ON HIS RELATION TODOROTHEA AND TO MR
 CASAUBONS TREATMENT OF HIM
 AND IN THE RUSH OFIMPULSES BY WHICH HE FLUNG BACK THAT OFFER OF BULSTRODES THERE WASMINGLED THE SENSE THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM EVER TOTELL DOROTHEA THAT HE HAD ACCEPTED IT
AS FOR BULSTRODEWHEN WILL WAS GONE HE SUFFERED A VIOLENT REACTION ANDWEPT LIKE A WOMAN
 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD ENCOUNTERED AN OPENEXPRESSION OF SCORN FROM ANY MAN HIGHER THAN RAFFLES AND WITH THATSCORN HURRYING LIKE VENOM THROUGH HIS SYSTEM THERE WAS NO SENSIBILITYLEFT TO CONSOLATIONS
 BUT THE RELIEF OF WEEPING HAD TO BE CHECKED
 HISWIFE AND DAUGHTERS SOON CAME HOME FROM HEARING THE ADDRESS OF ANORIENTAL MISSIONARY AND WERE FULL OF REGRET THAT PAPA HAD NOT HEARDIN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE INTERESTING THINGS WHICH THEY TRIED TOREPEAT TO HIM
PERHAPS THROUGH ALL OTHER HIDDEN THOUGHTS THE ONE THAT BREATHED MOSTCOMFORT WAS THAT WILL LADISLAW AT LEAST WAS NOT LIKELY TO PUBLISH WHATHAD TAKEN PLACE THAT EVENING
CHAPTER LXII
HE WAS A SQUYER OF LOWE DEGRETHAT LOVED THE KINGS DAUGHTER OF HUNGRIE
OLD ROMANCE
WILL LADISLAWS MIND WAS NOW WHOLLY BENT ON SEEING DOROTHEA AGAIN ANDFORTHWITH QUITTING MIDDLEMARCH
 THE MORNING AFTER HIS AGITATING SCENEWITH BULSTRODE HE WROTE A BRIEF LETTER TO HER SAYING THAT VARIOUSCAUSES HAD DETAINED HIM IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD LONGER THAN HE HADEXPECTED AND ASKING HER PERMISSION TO CALL AGAIN AT LOWICK AT SOMEHOUR WHICH SHE WOULD MENTION ON THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE DAY HE BEINGANXIOUS TO DEPART BUT UNWILLING TO DO SO UNTIL SHE HAD GRANTED HIM ANINTERVIEW
 HE LEFT THE LETTER AT THE OFFICE ORDERING THE MESSENGER TOCARRY IT TO LOWICK MANOR AND WAIT FOR AN ANSWER
LADISLAW FELT THE AWKWARDNESS OF ASKING FOR MORE LAST WORDS
 HIS FORMERFAREWELL HAD BEEN MADE IN THE HEARING OF SIR JAMES CHETTAM AND HADBEEN ANNOUNCED AS FINAL EVEN TO THE BUTLER
 IT IS CERTAINLY TRYING TO AMANS DIGNITY TO REAPPEAR WHEN HE IS NOT EXPECTED TO DO SO A FIRSTFAREWELL HAS PATHOS IN IT BUT TO COME BACK FOR A SECOND LENDS ANOPENING TO COMEDY AND IT WAS POSSIBLE EVEN THAT THERE MIGHT BE BITTERSNEERS AFLOAT ABOUT WILLS MOTIVES FOR LINGERING
 STILL IT WAS ON THEWHOLE MORE SATISFACTORY TO HIS FEELING TO TAKE THE DIRECTEST MEANS OFSEEING DOROTHEA THAN TO USE ANY DEVICE WHICH MIGHT GIVE AN AIR OFCHANCE TO A MEETING OF WHICH HE WISHED HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT WASWHAT HE EARNESTLY SOUGHT
 WHEN HE HAD PARTED FROM HER BEFORE HE HADBEEN IN IGNORANCE OF FACTS WHICH GAVE A NEW ASPECT TO THE RELATIONBETWEEN THEM AND MADE A MORE ABSOLUTE SEVERANCE THAN HE HAD THENBELIEVED IN
 HE KNEW NOTHING OF DOROTHEAS PRIVATE FORTUNE AND BEINGLITTLE USED TO REFLECT ON SUCH MATTERS TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THATACCORDING TO MR
 CASAUBONS ARRANGEMENT MARRIAGE TO HIM WILL LADISLAWWOULD MEAN THAT SHE CONSENTED TO BE PENNILESS
 THAT WAS NOT WHAT HECOULD WISH FOR EVEN IN HIS SECRET HEART OR EVEN IF SHE HAD BEEN READYTO MEET SUCH HARD CONTRAST FOR HIS SAKE
 AND THEN TOO THERE WAS THEFRESH SMART OF THAT DISCLOSURE ABOUT HIS MOTHERS FAMILY WHICH IFKNOWN WOULD BE AN ADDED REASON WHY DOROTHEAS FRIENDS SHOULD LOOK DOWNUPON HIM AS UTTERLY BELOW HER
 THE SECRET HOPE THAT AFTER SOME YEARS HEMIGHT COME BACK WITH THE SENSE THAT HE HAD AT LEAST A PERSONAL VALUEEQUAL TO HER WEALTH SEEMED NOW THE DREAMY CONTINUATION OF A DREAM
THIS CHANGE WOULD SURELY JUSTIFY HIM IN ASKING DOROTHEA TO RECEIVE HIMONCE MORE
BUT DOROTHEA ON THAT MORNING WAS NOT AT HOME TO RECEIVE WILLS NOTE
 INCONSEQUENCE OF A LETTER FROM HER UNCLE ANNOUNCING HIS INTENTION TO BEAT HOME IN A WEEK SHE HAD DRIVEN FIRST TO FRESHITT TO CARRY THE NEWSMEANING TO GO ON TO THE GRANGE TO DELIVER SOME ORDERS WITH WHICH HERUNCLE HAD INTRUSTED HERTHINKING AS HE SAID A LITTLE MENTALOCCUPATION OF THIS SORT GOOD FOR A WIDOW
IF WILL LADISLAW COULD HAVE OVERHEARD SOME OF THE TALK AT FRESHITT THATMORNING HE WOULD HAVE FELT ALL HIS SUPPOSITIONS CONFIRMED AS TO THEREADINESS OF CERTAIN PEOPLE TO SNEER AT HIS LINGERING IN THENEIGHBORHOOD
 SIR JAMES INDEED THOUGH MUCH RELIEVED CONCERNINGDOROTHEA HAD BEEN ON THE WATCH TO LEARN LADISLAWS MOVEMENTS AND HADAN INSTRUCTED INFORMANT IN MR
 STANDISH WHO WAS NECESSARILY IN HISCONFIDENCE ON THIS MATTER
 THAT LADISLAW HAD STAYED IN MIDDLEMARCHNEARLY TWO MONTHS AFTER HE HAD DECLARED THAT HE WAS GOING IMMEDIATELYWAS A FACT TO EMBITTER SIR JAMESS SUSPICIONS OR AT LEAST TO JUSTIFYHIS AVERSION TO A YOUNG FELLOW WHOM HE REPRESENTED TO HIMSELF ASSLIGHT VOLATILE AND LIKELY ENOUGH TO SHOW SUCH RECKLESSNESS ASNATURALLY WENT ALONG WITH A POSITION UNRIVETED BY FAMILY TIES OR ASTRICT PROFESSION
 BUT HE HAD JUST HEARD SOMETHING FROM STANDISH WHICHWHILE IT JUSTIFIED THESE SURMISES ABOUT WILL OFFERED A MEANS OFNULLIFYING ALL DANGER WITH REGARD TO DOROTHEA
UNWONTED CIRCUMSTANCES MAY MAKE US ALL RATHER UNLIKE OURSELVES THEREARE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE MOST MAJESTIC PERSON IS OBLIGED TOSNEEZE AND OUR EMOTIONS ARE LIABLE TO BE ACTED ON IN THE SAMEINCONGRUOUS MANNER
 GOOD SIR JAMES WAS THIS MORNING SO FAR UNLIKEHIMSELF THAT HE WAS IRRITABLY ANXIOUS TO SAY SOMETHING TO DOROTHEA ON ASUBJECT WHICH HE USUALLY AVOIDED AS IF IT HAD BEEN A MATTER OF SHAME TOTHEM BOTH
 HE COULD NOT USE CELIA AS A MEDIUM BECAUSE HE DID NOTCHOOSE THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THE KIND OF GOSSIP HE HAD IN HIS MIND ANDBEFORE DOROTHEA HAPPENED TO ARRIVE HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO IMAGINE HOWWITH HIS SHYNESS AND UNREADY TONGUE HE COULD EVER MANAGE TO INTRODUCEHIS COMMUNICATION
 HER UNEXPECTED PRESENCE BROUGHT HIM TO UTTERHOPELESSNESS IN HIS OWN POWER OF SAYING ANYTHING UNPLEASANT BUTDESPERATION SUGGESTED A RESOURCE HE SENT THE GROOM ON AN UNSADDLEDHORSE ACROSS THE PARK WITH A PENCILLED NOTE TO MRS
 CADWALLADER WHOALREADY KNEW THE GOSSIP AND WOULD THINK IT NO COMPROMISE OF HERSELF TOREPEAT IT AS OFTEN AS REQUIRED
DOROTHEA WAS DETAINED ON THE GOOD PRETEXT THAT MR
 GARTH WHOM SHEWANTED TO SEE WAS EXPECTED AT THE HALL WITHIN THE HOUR AND SHE WASSTILL TALKING TO CALEB ON THE GRAVEL WHEN SIR JAMES ON THE WATCH FORTHE RECTORS WIFE SAW HER COMING AND MET HER WITH THE NEEDFUL HINTS
ENOUGH
 I UNDERSTANDSAID MRS
 CADWALLADER
 YOU SHALL BE INNOCENT
I AM SUCH A BLACKAMOOR THAT I CANNOT SMIRCH MYSELF
I DONT MEAN THAT ITS OF ANY CONSEQUENCE SAID SIR JAMES DISLIKINGTHAT MRS
 CADWALLADER SHOULD UNDERSTAND TOO MUCH
 ONLY IT IS DESIRABLETHAT DOROTHEA SHOULD KNOW THERE ARE REASONS WHY SHE SHOULD NOT RECEIVEHIM AGAIN AND I REALLY CANT SAY SO TO HER
 IT WILL COME LIGHTLY FROMYOU
IT CAME VERY LIGHTLY INDEED
 WHEN DOROTHEA QUITTED CALEB AND TURNED TOMEET THEM IT APPEARED THAT MRS
 CADWALLADER HAD STEPPED ACROSS THEPARK BY THE MEREST CHANCE IN THE WORLD JUST TO CHAT WITH CELIA IN AMATRONLY WAY ABOUT THE BABY
 AND SO MR
 BROOKE WAS COMING BACK
DELIGHTFUL
COMING BACK IT WAS TO BE HOPED QUITE CURED OFPARLIAMENTARY FEVER AND PIONEERING
 APROPOS OF THE PIONEERSOMEBODYHAD PROPHESIED THAT IT WOULD SOON BE LIKE A DYING DOLPHIN AND TURN ALLCOLORS FOR WANT OF KNOWING HOW TO HELP ITSELF BECAUSE MR
 BROOKESPROTEGE THE BRILLIANT YOUNG LADISLAW WAS GONE OR GOING
 HAD SIR JAMESHEARD THAT
THE THREE WERE WALKING ALONG THE GRAVEL SLOWLY AND SIR JAMES TURNINGASIDE TO WHIP A SHRUB SAID HE HAD HEARD SOMETHING OF THAT SORT
ALL FALSE
 SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER
 HE IS NOT GONE OR GOINGAPPARENTLY THE PIONEER KEEPS ITS COLOR AND MR
 ORLANDO LADISLAW ISMAKING A SAD DARKBLUE SCANDAL BY WARBLING CONTINUALLY WITH YOUR MR
LYDGATES WIFE WHO THEY TELL ME IS AS PRETTY AS PRETTY CAN BE
 ITSEEMS NOBODY EVER GOES INTO THE HOUSE WITHOUT FINDING THIS YOUNGGENTLEMAN LYING ON THE RUG OR WARBLING AT THE PIANO
 BUT THE PEOPLE INMANUFACTURING TOWNS ARE ALWAYS DISREPUTABLE
YOU BEGAN BY SAYING THAT ONE REPORT WAS FALSE MRS
 CADWALLADER AND IBELIEVE THIS IS FALSE TOO SAID DOROTHEA WITH INDIGNANT ENERGY ATLEAST I FEEL SURE IT IS A MISREPRESENTATION
 I WILL NOT HEAR ANY EVILSPOKEN OF MR
 LADISLAW HE HAS ALREADY SUFFERED TOO MUCH INJUSTICE
DOROTHEA WHEN THOROUGHLY MOVED CARED LITTLE WHAT ANY ONE THOUGHT OF HERFEELINGS AND EVEN IF SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO REFLECT SHE WOULD HAVE HELDIT PETTY TO KEEP SILENCE AT INJURIOUS WORDS ABOUT WILL FROM FEAR OFBEING HERSELF MISUNDERSTOOD
 HER FACE WAS FLUSHED AND HER LIP TREMBLED
SIR JAMES GLANCING AT HER REPENTED OF HIS STRATAGEM BUT MRS
CADWALLADER EQUAL TO ALL OCCASIONS SPREAD THE PALMS OF HER HANDSOUTWARD AND SAIDHEAVEN GRANT IT MY DEAR
I MEAN THAT ALL BAD TALESABOUT ANYBODY MAY BE FALSE
 BUT IT IS A PITY THAT YOUNG LYDGATE SHOULDHAVE MARRIED ONE OF THESE MIDDLEMARCH GIRLS
 CONSIDERING HES A SON OFSOMEBODY HE MIGHT HAVE GOT A WOMAN WITH GOOD BLOOD IN HER VEINS ANDNOT TOO YOUNG WHO WOULD HAVE PUT UP WITH HIS PROFESSION
 THERES CLARAHARFAGER FOR INSTANCE WHOSE FRIENDS DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HERAND SHE HAS A PORTION
 THEN WE MIGHT HAVE HAD HER AMONG US
HOWEVER
ITS NO USE BEING WISE FOR OTHER PEOPLE
 WHERE IS CELIA
 PRAYLET US GO IN
I AM GOING ON IMMEDIATELY TO TIPTON SAID DOROTHEA RATHER HAUGHTILY
GOODBY
SIR JAMES COULD SAY NOTHING AS HE ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE CARRIAGE
 HEWAS ALTOGETHER DISCONTENTED WITH THE RESULT OF A CONTRIVANCE WHICH HADCOST HIM SOME SECRET HUMILIATION BEFOREHAND
DOROTHEA DROVE ALONG BETWEEN THE BERRIED HEDGEROWS AND THE SHORNCORNFIELDS NOT SEEING OR HEARING ANYTHING AROUND
 THE TEARS CAME ANDROLLED DOWN HER CHEEKS BUT SHE DID NOT KNOW IT
 THE WORLD IT SEEMEDWAS TURNING UGLY AND HATEFUL AND THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR HERTRUSTFULNESS
 IT IS NOT TRUEIT IS NOT TRUE
 WAS THE VOICE WITHIN HERTHAT SHE LISTENED TO BUT ALL THE WHILE A REMEMBRANCE TO WHICH THEREHAD ALWAYS CLUNG A VAGUE UNEASINESS WOULD THRUST ITSELF ON HERATTENTIONTHE REMEMBRANCE OF THAT DAY WHEN SHE HAD FOUND WILL LADISLAWWITH MRS
 LYDGATE AND HAD HEARD HIS VOICE ACCOMPANIED BY THE PIANO
HE SAID HE WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING THAT I DISAPPROVEDI WISH I COULDHAVE TOLD HIM THAT I DISAPPROVED OF THAT SAID POOR DOROTHEAINWARDLY FEELING A STRANGE ALTERNATION BETWEEN ANGER WITH WILL AND THEPASSIONATE DEFENCE OF HIM
 THEY ALL TRY TO BLACKEN HIM BEFORE ME BUTI WILL CARE FOR NO PAIN IF HE IS NOT TO BLAME
 I ALWAYS BELIEVED HEWAS GOOD
THESE WERE HER LAST THOUGHTS BEFORE SHE FELT THAT THECARRIAGE WAS PASSING UNDER THE ARCHWAY OF THE LODGEGATE AT THE GRANGEWHEN SHE HURRIEDLY PRESSED HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER FACE AND BEGAN TOTHINK OF HER ERRANDS
 THE COACHMAN BEGGED LEAVE TO TAKE OUT THE HORSESFOR HALF AN HOUR AS THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH A SHOE ANDDOROTHEA HAVING THE SENSE THAT SHE WAS GOING TO REST TOOK OFF HERGLOVES AND BONNET WHILE SHE WAS LEANING AGAINST A STATUE IN THEENTRANCEHALL AND TALKING TO THE HOUSEKEEPER
 AT LAST SHE SAIDI MUST STAY HERE A LITTLE MRS
 KELL
 I WILL GO INTO THE LIBRARY ANDWRITE YOU SOME MEMORANDA FROM MY UNCLES LETTER IF YOU WILL OPEN THESHUTTERS FOR ME
THE SHUTTERS ARE OPEN MADAM SAID MRS
 KELL FOLLOWING DOROTHEA WHOHAD WALKED ALONG AS SHE SPOKE
 MR
 LADISLAW IS THERE LOOKING FORSOMETHING
WILL HAD COME TO FETCH A PORTFOLIO OF HIS OWN SKETCHES WHICH HE HADMISSED IN THE ACT OF PACKING HIS MOVABLES AND DID NOT CHOOSE TO LEAVEBEHIND
DOROTHEAS HEART SEEMED TO TURN OVER AS IF IT HAD HAD A BLOW BUT SHEWAS NOT PERCEPTIBLY CHECKED IN TRUTH THE SENSE THAT WILL WAS THEREWAS FOR THE MOMENT ALLSATISFYING TO HER LIKE THE SIGHT OF SOMETHINGPRECIOUS THAT ONE HAS LOST
 WHEN SHE REACHED THE DOOR SHE SAID TO MRS
KELLGO IN FIRST AND TELL HIM THAT I AM HERE
WILL HAD FOUND HIS PORTFOLIO AND HAD LAID IT ON THE TABLE AT THE FAREND OF THE ROOM TO TURN OVER THE SKETCHES AND PLEASE HIMSELF BYLOOKING AT THE MEMORABLE PIECE OF ART WHICH HAD A RELATION TO NATURETOO MYSTERIOUS FOR DOROTHEA
 HE WAS SMILING AT IT STILL AND SHAKINGTHE SKETCHES INTO ORDER WITH THE THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT FIND A LETTERFROM HER AWAITING HIM AT MIDDLEMARCH WHEN MRS
 KELL CLOSE TO HIS ELBOWSAIDMRS
 CASAUBON IS COMING IN SIR
WILL TURNED ROUND QUICKLY AND THE NEXT MOMENT DOROTHEA WAS ENTERING
AS MRS
 KELL CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER THEY MET EACH WAS LOOKING ATTHE OTHER AND CONSCIOUSNESS WAS OVERFLOWED BY SOMETHING THATSUPPRESSED UTTERANCE
 IT WAS NOT CONFUSION THAT KEPT THEM SILENT FORTHEY BOTH FELT THAT PARTING WAS NEAR AND THERE IS NO SHAMEFACEDNESS INA SAD PARTING
SHE MOVED AUTOMATICALLY TOWARDS HER UNCLES CHAIR AGAINST THEWRITINGTABLE AND WILL AFTER DRAWING IT OUT A LITTLE FOR HER WENT AFEW PACES OFF AND STOOD OPPOSITE TO HER
PRAY SIT DOWN SAID DOROTHEA CROSSING HER HANDS ON HER LAP I AMVERY GLAD YOU WERE HERE
 WILL THOUGHT THAT HER FACE LOOKED JUST AS ITDID WHEN SHE FIRST SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM IN ROME FOR HER WIDOWS CAPFIXED IN HER BONNET HAD GONE OFF WITH IT AND HE COULD SEE THAT SHEHAD LATELY BEEN SHEDDING TEARS
 BUT THE MIXTURE OF ANGER IN HERAGITATION HAD VANISHED AT THE SIGHT OF HIM SHE HAD BEEN USED WHENTHEY WERE FACE TO FACE ALWAYS TO FEEL CONFIDENCE AND THE HAPPY FREEDOMWHICH COMES WITH MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND HOW COULD OTHER PEOPLESWORDS HINDER THAT EFFECT ON A SUDDEN
 LET THE MUSIC WHICH CAN TAKEPOSSESSION OF OUR FRAME AND FILL THE AIR WITH JOY FOR US SOUND ONCEMOREWHAT DOES IT SIGNIFY THAT WE HEARD IT FOUND FAULT WITH IN ITSABSENCE
I HAVE SENT A LETTER TO LOWICK MANOR TODAY ASKING LEAVE TO SEE YOUSAID WILL SEATING HIMSELF OPPOSITE TO HER
 I AM GOING AWAYIMMEDIATELY AND I COULD NOT GO WITHOUT SPEAKING TO YOU AGAIN
I THOUGHT WE HAD PARTED WHEN YOU CAME TO LOWICK MANY WEEKS AGOYOUTHOUGHT YOU WERE GOING THEN SAID DOROTHEA HER VOICE TREMBLING ALITTLE
YES BUT I WAS IN IGNORANCE THEN OF THINGS WHICH I KNOW NOWTHINGSWHICH HAVE ALTERED MY FEELINGS ABOUT THE FUTURE
 WHEN I SAW YOU BEFOREI WAS DREAMING THAT I MIGHT COME BACK SOME DAY
 I DONT THINK I EVERSHALLNOW
 WILL PAUSED HERE
YOU WISHED ME TO KNOW THE REASONS
 SAID DOROTHEA TIMIDLY
YES SAID WILL IMPETUOUSLY SHAKING HIS HEAD BACKWARD AND LOOKINGAWAY FROM HER WITH IRRITATION IN HIS FACE
 OF COURSE I MUST WISH IT
 IHAVE BEEN GROSSLY INSULTED IN YOUR EYES AND IN THE EYES OF OTHERS
THERE HAS BEEN A MEAN IMPLICATION AGAINST MY CHARACTER
 I WISH YOU TOKNOW THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD I HAVE LOWERED MYSELF BYUNDERNO CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD I HAVE GIVEN MEN THE CHANCE OF SAYING THAT ISOUGHT MONEY UNDER THE PRETEXT OF SEEKINGSOMETHING ELSE
 THERE WAS NONEED OF OTHER SAFEGUARD AGAINST METHE SAFEGUARD OF WEALTH WAS ENOUGH
WILL ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR WITH THE LAST WORD AND WENTHE HARDLY KNEWWHERE BUT IT WAS TO THE PROJECTING WINDOW NEAREST HIM WHICH HAD BEENOPEN AS NOW ABOUT THE SAME SEASON A YEAR AGO WHEN HE AND DOROTHEA HADSTOOD WITHIN IT AND TALKED TOGETHER
 HER WHOLE HEART WAS GOING OUT ATTHIS MOMENT IN SYMPATHY WITH WILLS INDIGNATION SHE ONLY WANTED TOCONVINCE HIM THAT SHE HAD NEVER DONE HIM INJUSTICE AND HE SEEMED TOHAVE TURNED AWAY FROM HER AS IF SHE TOO HAD BEEN PART OF THE UNFRIENDLYWORLD
IT WOULD BE VERY UNKIND OF YOU TO SUPPOSE THAT I EVER ATTRIBUTED ANYMEANNESS TO YOU SHE BEGAN
 THEN IN HER ARDENT WAY WANTING TO PLEADWITH HIM SHE MOVED FROM HER CHAIR AND WENT IN FRONT OF HIM TO HER OLDPLACE IN THE WINDOW SAYING DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT I EVER DISBELIEVED INYOU
WHEN WILL SAW HER THERE HE GAVE A START AND MOVED BACKWARD OUT OF THEWINDOW WITHOUT MEETING HER GLANCE
 DOROTHEA WAS HURT BY THIS MOVEMENTFOLLOWING UP THE PREVIOUS ANGER OF HIS TONE
 SHE WAS READY TO SAY THATIT WAS AS HARD ON HER AS ON HIM AND THAT SHE WAS HELPLESS BUT THOSESTRANGE PARTICULARS OF THEIR RELATION WHICH NEITHER OF THEM COULDEXPLICITLY MENTION KEPT HER ALWAYS IN DREAD OF SAYING TOO MUCH
 AT THISMOMENT SHE HAD NO BELIEF THAT WILL WOULD IN ANY CASE HAVE WANTED TOMARRY HER AND SHE FEARED USING WORDS WHICH MIGHT IMPLY SUCH A BELIEF
SHE ONLY SAID EARNESTLY RECURRING TO HIS LAST WORDI AM SURE NO SAFEGUARD WAS EVER NEEDED AGAINST YOU
WILL DID NOT ANSWER
 IN THE STORMY FLUCTUATION OF HIS FEELINGS THESEWORDS OF HERS SEEMED TO HIM CRUELLY NEUTRAL AND HE LOOKED PALE ANDMISERABLE AFTER HIS ANGRY OUTBURST
 HE WENT TO THE TABLE AND FASTENEDUP HIS PORTFOLIO WHILE DOROTHEA LOOKED AT HIM FROM THE DISTANCE
 THEYWERE WASTING THESE LAST MOMENTS TOGETHER IN WRETCHED SILENCE
 WHATCOULD HE SAY SINCE WHAT HAD GOT OBSTINATELY UPPERMOST IN HIS MIND WASTHE PASSIONATE LOVE FOR HER WHICH HE FORBADE HIMSELF TO UTTER
 WHATCOULD SHE SAY SINCE SHE MIGHT OFFER HIM NO HELPSINCE SHE WAS FORCEDTO KEEP THE MONEY THAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN HIS
SINCE TODAY HE SEEMEDNOT TO RESPOND AS HE USED TO DO TO HER THOROUGH TRUST AND LIKING
BUT WILL AT LAST TURNED AWAY FROM HIS PORTFOLIO AND APPROACHED THEWINDOW AGAIN
I MUST GO HE SAID WITH THAT PECULIAR LOOK OF THE EYES WHICHSOMETIMES ACCOMPANIES BITTER FEELING AS IF THEY HAD BEEN TIRED ANDBURNED WITH GAZING TOO CLOSE AT A LIGHT
WHAT SHALL YOU DO IN LIFE
 SAID DOROTHEA TIMIDLY
 HAVE YOURINTENTIONS REMAINED JUST THE SAME AS WHEN WE SAID GOODBY BEFORE
YES SAID WILL IN A TONE THAT SEEMED TO WAIVE THE SUBJECT ASUNINTERESTING
 I SHALL WORK AWAY AT THE FIRST THING THAT OFFERS
 ISUPPOSE ONE GETS A HABIT OF DOING WITHOUT HAPPINESS OR HOPE
OH WHAT SAD WORDS
 SAID DOROTHEA WITH A DANGEROUS TENDENCY TO SOB
THEN TRYING TO SMILE SHE ADDED WE USED TO AGREE THAT WE WERE ALIKEIN SPEAKING TOO STRONGLY
I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TOO STRONGLY NOW SAID WILL LEANING BACK AGAINSTTHE ANGLE OF THE WALL
 THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WHICH A MAN CAN ONLYGO THROUGH ONCE IN HIS LIFE AND HE MUST KNOW SOME TIME OR OTHER THATTHE BEST IS OVER WITH HIM
 THIS EXPERIENCE HAS HAPPENED TO ME WHILE IAM VERY YOUNGTHAT IS ALL
 WHAT I CARE MORE FOR THAN I CAN EVER CAREFOR ANYTHING ELSE IS ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN TO MEI DONT MEAN MERELY BYBEING OUT OF MY REACH BUT FORBIDDEN ME EVEN IF IT WERE WITHIN MYREACH BY MY OWN PRIDE AND HONORBY EVERYTHING I RESPECT MYSELF FOR
 OFCOURSE I SHALL GO ON LIVING AS A MAN MIGHT DO WHO HAD SEEN HEAVEN IN ATRANCE
WILL PAUSED IMAGINING THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR DOROTHEA TOMISUNDERSTAND THIS INDEED HE FELT THAT HE WAS CONTRADICTING HIMSELFAND OFFENDING AGAINST HIS SELFAPPROVAL IN SPEAKING TO HER SO PLAINLYBUT STILLIT COULD NOT BE FAIRLY CALLED WOOING A WOMAN TO TELL HER THATHE WOULD NEVER WOO HER
 IT MUST BE ADMITTED TO BE A GHOSTLY KIND OFWOOING
BUT DOROTHEAS MIND WAS RAPIDLY GOING OVER THE PAST WITH QUITE ANOTHERVISION THAN HIS
 THE THOUGHT THAT SHE HERSELF MIGHT BE WHAT WILL MOSTCARED FOR DID THROB THROUGH HER AN INSTANT BUT THEN CAME DOUBT THEMEMORY OF THE LITTLE THEY HAD LIVED THROUGH TOGETHER TURNED PALE ANDSHRANK BEFORE THE MEMORY WHICH SUGGESTED HOW MUCH FULLER MIGHT HAVEBEEN THE INTERCOURSE BETWEEN WILL AND SOME ONE ELSE WITH WHOM HE HADHAD CONSTANT COMPANIONSHIP
 EVERYTHING HE HAD SAID MIGHT REFER TO THATOTHER RELATION AND WHATEVER HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND HERSELF WASTHOROUGHLY EXPLAINED BY WHAT SHE HAD ALWAYS REGARDED AS THEIR SIMPLEFRIENDSHIP AND THE CRUEL OBSTRUCTION THRUST UPON IT BY HER HUSBANDSINJURIOUS ACT
 DOROTHEA STOOD SILENT WITH HER EYES CAST DOWN DREAMILYWHILE IMAGES CROWDED UPON HER WHICH LEFT THE SICKENING CERTAINTY THATWILL WAS REFERRING TO MRS
 LYDGATE
 BUT WHY SICKENING
 HE WANTED HER TOKNOW THAT HERE TOO HIS CONDUCT SHOULD BE ABOVE SUSPICION
WILL WAS NOT SURPRISED AT HER SILENCE
 HIS MIND ALSO WAS TUMULTUOUSLYBUSY WHILE HE WATCHED HER AND HE WAS FEELING RATHER WILDLY THATSOMETHING MUST HAPPEN TO HINDER THEIR PARTINGSOME MIRACLE CLEARLYNOTHING IN THEIR OWN DELIBERATE SPEECH
 YET AFTER ALL HAD SHE ANYLOVE FOR HIM
HE COULD NOT PRETEND TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD RATHERBELIEVE HER TO BE WITHOUT THAT PAIN
 HE COULD NOT DENY THAT A SECRETLONGING FOR THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE LOVED HIM WAS AT THE ROOT OF ALL HISWORDS
NEITHER OF THEM KNEW HOW LONG THEY STOOD IN THAT WAY
 DOROTHEA WASRAISING HER EYES AND WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND HERFOOTMAN CAME TO SAYTHE HORSES ARE READY MADAM WHENEVER YOU LIKE TO START
PRESENTLY SAID DOROTHEA
 THEN TURNING TO WILL SHE SAID I HAVESOME MEMORANDA TO WRITE FOR THE HOUSEKEEPER
I MUST GO SAID WILL WHEN THE DOOR HAD CLOSED AGAINADVANCINGTOWARDS HER
 THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW I SHALL LEAVE MIDDLEMARCH
YOU HAVE ACTED IN EVERY WAY RIGHTLY SAID DOROTHEA IN A LOW TONEFEELING A PRESSURE AT HER HEART WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT TO SPEAK
SHE PUT OUT HER HAND AND WILL TOOK IT FOR AN INSTANT WITHOUT SPEAKINGFOR HER WORDS HAD SEEMED TO HIM CRUELLY COLD AND UNLIKE HERSELF
 THEIREYES MET BUT THERE WAS DISCONTENT IN HIS AND IN HERS THERE WAS ONLYSADNESS
 HE TURNED AWAY AND TOOK HIS PORTFOLIO UNDER HIS ARM
I HAVE NEVER DONE YOU INJUSTICE
 PLEASE REMEMBER ME SAID DOROTHEAREPRESSING A RISING SOB
WHY SHOULD YOU SAY THAT
 SAID WILL WITH IRRITATION
 AS IF I WERENOT IN DANGER OF FORGETTING EVERYTHING ELSE
HE HAD REALLY A MOVEMENT OF ANGER AGAINST HER AT THAT MOMENT AND ITIMPELLED HIM TO GO AWAY WITHOUT PAUSE
 IT WAS ALL ONE FLASH TODOROTHEAHIS LAST WORDSHIS DISTANT BOW TO HER AS HE REACHED THEDOORTHE SENSE THAT HE WAS NO LONGER THERE
 SHE SANK INTO THE CHAIRAND FOR A FEW MOMENTS SAT LIKE A STATUE WHILE IMAGES AND EMOTIONS WEREHURRYING UPON HER
 JOY CAME FIRST IN SPITE OF THE THREATENING TRAINBEHIND ITJOY IN THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS REALLY HERSELF WHOM WILLLOVED AND WAS RENOUNCING THAT THERE WAS REALLY NO OTHER LOVE LESSPERMISSIBLE MORE BLAMEWORTHY WHICH HONOR WAS HURRYING HIM AWAY FROM
THEY WERE PARTED ALL THE SAME BUTDOROTHEA DREW A DEEP BREATH AND FELTHER STRENGTH RETURNSHE COULD THINK OF HIM UNRESTRAINEDLY
 AT THATMOMENT THE PARTING WAS EASY TO BEAR THE FIRST SENSE OF LOVING ANDBEING LOVED EXCLUDED SORROW
 IT WAS AS IF SOME HARD ICY PRESSURE HADMELTED AND HER CONSCIOUSNESS HAD ROOM TO EXPAND HER PAST WAS COMEBACK TO HER WITH LARGER INTERPRETATION
 THE JOY WAS NOT THELESSPERHAPS IT WAS THE MORE COMPLETE JUST THENBECAUSE OF THEIRREVOCABLE PARTING FOR THERE WAS NO REPROACH NO CONTEMPTUOUS WONDERTO IMAGINE IN ANY EYE OR FROM ANY LIPS
 HE HAD ACTED SO AS TO DEFYREPROACH AND MAKE WONDER RESPECTFUL
ANY ONE WATCHING HER MIGHT HAVE SEEN THAT THERE WAS A FORTIFYINGTHOUGHT WITHIN HER
 JUST AS WHEN INVENTIVE POWER IS WORKING WITH GLADEASE SOME SMALL CLAIM ON THE ATTENTION IS FULLY MET AS IF IT WERE ONLYA CRANNY OPENED TO THE SUNLIGHT IT WAS EASY NOW FOR DOROTHEA TO WRITEHER MEMORANDA
 SHE SPOKE HER LAST WORDS TO THE HOUSEKEEPER IN CHEERFULTONES AND WHEN SHE SEATED HERSELF IN THE CARRIAGE HER EYES WERE BRIGHTAND HER CHEEKS BLOOMING UNDER THE DISMAL BONNET
 SHE THREW BACK THEHEAVY WEEPERS AND LOOKED BEFORE HER WONDERING WHICH ROAD WILL HADTAKEN
 IT WAS IN HER NATURE TO BE PROUD THAT HE WAS BLAMELESS ANDTHROUGH ALL HER FEELINGS THERE RAN THIS VEINI WAS RIGHT TO DEFENDHIM
THE COACHMAN WAS USED TO DRIVE HIS GRAYS AT A GOOD PACE MR
 CASAUBONBEING UNENJOYING AND IMPATIENT IN EVERYTHING AWAY FROM HIS DESK ANDWANTING TO GET TO THE END OF ALL JOURNEYS AND DOROTHEA WAS NOW BOWLEDALONG QUICKLY
 DRIVING WAS PLEASANT FOR RAIN IN THE NIGHT HAD LAID THEDUST AND THE BLUE SKY LOOKED FAR OFF AWAY FROM THE REGION OF THEGREAT CLOUDS THAT SAILED IN MASSES
 THE EARTH LOOKED LIKE A HAPPY PLACEUNDER THE VAST HEAVENS AND DOROTHEA WAS WISHING THAT SHE MIGHTOVERTAKE WILL AND SEE HIM ONCE MORE
AFTER A TURN OF THE ROAD THERE HE WAS WITH THE PORTFOLIO UNDER HISARM BUT THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS PASSING HIM WHILE HE RAISED HIS HATAND SHE FELT A PANG AT BEING SEATED THERE IN A SORT OF EXALTATIONLEAVING HIM BEHIND
 SHE COULD NOT LOOK BACK AT HIM
 IT WAS AS IF ACROWD OF INDIFFERENT OBJECTS HAD THRUST THEM ASUNDER AND FORCED THEMALONG DIFFERENT PATHS TAKING THEM FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM EACHOTHER AND MAKING IT USELESS TO LOOK BACK
 SHE COULD NO MORE MAKE ANYSIGN THAT WOULD SEEM TO SAY NEED WE PART
 THAN SHE COULD STOP THECARRIAGE TO WAIT FOR HIM
 NAY WHAT A WORLD OF REASONS CROWDED UPON HERAGAINST ANY MOVEMENT OF HER THOUGHT TOWARDS A FUTURE THAT MIGHT REVERSETHE DECISION OF THIS DAY
I ONLY WISH I HAD KNOWN BEFOREI WISH HE KNEWTHEN WE COULD BE QUITEHAPPY IN THINKING OF EACH OTHER THOUGH WE ARE FOREVER PARTED
 AND IF ICOULD BUT HAVE GIVEN HIM THE MONEY AND MADE THINGS EASIER FORHIM
WERE THE LONGINGS THAT CAME BACK THE MOST PERSISTENTLY
 AND YETSO HEAVILY DID THE WORLD WEIGH ON HER IN SPITE OF HER INDEPENDENTENERGY THAT WITH THIS IDEA OF WILL AS IN NEED OF SUCH HELP AND AT ADISADVANTAGE WITH THE WORLD THERE CAME ALWAYS THE VISION OF THATUNFITTINGNESS OF ANY CLOSER RELATION BETWEEN THEM WHICH LAY IN THEOPINION OF EVERY ONE CONNECTED WITH HER
 SHE FELT TO THE FULL ALL THEIMPERATIVENESS OF THE MOTIVES WHICH URGED WILLS CONDUCT
 HOW COULD HEDREAM OF HER DEFYING THE BARRIER THAT HER HUSBAND HAD PLACED BETWEENTHEM
HOW COULD SHE EVER SAY TO HERSELF THAT SHE WOULD DEFY IT
WILLS CERTAINTY AS THE CARRIAGE GREW SMALLER IN THE DISTANCE HAD MUCHMORE BITTERNESS IN IT
 VERY SLIGHT MATTERS WERE ENOUGH TO GALL HIM INHIS SENSITIVE MOOD AND THE SIGHT OF DOROTHEA DRIVING PAST HIM WHILE HEFELT HIMSELF PLODDING ALONG AS A POOR DEVIL SEEKING A POSITION IN AWORLD WHICH IN HIS PRESENT TEMPER OFFERED HIM LITTLE THAT HE COVETEDMADE HIS CONDUCT SEEM A MERE MATTER OF NECESSITY AND TOOK AWAY THESUSTAINMENT OF RESOLVE
 AFTER ALL HE HAD NO ASSURANCE THAT SHE LOVEDHIM COULD ANY MAN PRETEND THAT HE WAS SIMPLY GLAD IN SUCH A CASE TOHAVE THE SUFFERING ALL ON HIS OWN SIDE
THAT EVENING WILL SPENT WITH THE LYDGATES THE NEXT EVENING HE WASGONE

THESE LITTLE THINGS ARE GREAT TO LITTLE MAN
GOLDSMITH
HAVE YOU SEEN MUCH OF YOUR SCIENTIFIC PHOENIX LYDGATE LATELY
 SAIDMR
 TOLLER AT ONE OF HIS CHRISTMAS DINNERPARTIES SPEAKING TO MR
FAREBROTHER ON HIS RIGHT HAND
NOT MUCH I AM SORRY TO SAY ANSWERED THE VICAR ACCUSTOMED TO PARRYMR
 TOLLERS BANTER ABOUT HIS BELIEF IN THE NEW MEDICAL LIGHT
 I AMOUT OF THE WAY AND HE IS TOO BUSY
IS HE
 I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID DR
 MINCHIN WITH MINGLED SUAVITYAND SURPRISE
HE GIVES A GREAT DEAL OF TIME TO THE NEW HOSPITAL SAID MR
FAREBROTHER WHO HAD HIS REASONS FOR CONTINUING THE SUBJECT I HEAR OFTHAT FROM MY NEIGHBOR MRS
 CASAUBON WHO GOES THERE OFTEN
 SHE SAYSLYDGATE IS INDEFATIGABLE AND IS MAKING A FINE THING OF BULSTRODESINSTITUTION
 HE IS PREPARING A NEW WARD IN CASE OF THE CHOLERA COMINGTO US
AND PREPARING THEORIES OF TREATMENT TO TRY ON THE PATIENTS ISUPPOSE SAID MR
 TOLLER
COME TOLLER BE CANDID SAID MR
 FAREBROTHER
 YOU ARE TOO CLEVERNOT TO SEE THE GOOD OF A BOLD FRESH MIND IN MEDICINE AS WELL AS INEVERYTHING ELSE AND AS TO CHOLERA I FANCY NONE OF YOU ARE VERY SUREWHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO
 IF A MAN GOES A LITTLE TOO FAR ALONG A NEW ROADIT IS USUALLY HIMSELF THAT HE HARMS MORE THAN ANY ONE ELSE
I AM SURE YOU AND WRENCH OUGHT TO BE OBLIGED TO HIM SAID DR
MINCHIN LOOKING TOWARDS TOLLER FOR HE HAS SENT YOU THE CREAM OFPEACOCKS PATIENTS
LYDGATE HAS BEEN LIVING AT A GREAT RATE FOR A YOUNG BEGINNER SAIDMR
 HARRY TOLLER THE BREWER
 I SUPPOSE HIS RELATIONS IN THE NORTHBACK HIM UP
I HOPE SO SAID MR
 CHICHELY ELSE HE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE MARRIED THATNICE GIRL WE WERE ALL SO FOND OF
 HANG IT ONE HAS A GRUDGE AGAINST AMAN WHO CARRIES OFF THE PRETTIEST GIRL IN THE TOWN
AY BY GOD
 AND THE BEST TOO SAID MR
 STANDISH
MY FRIEND VINCY DIDNT HALF LIKE THE MARRIAGE I KNOW THAT SAID MR
CHICHELY
 HE WOULDNT DO MUCH
 HOW THE RELATIONS ON THE OTHER SIDEMAY HAVE COME DOWN I CANT SAY
 THERE WAS AN EMPHATIC KIND OFRETICENCE IN MR
 CHICHELYS MANNER OF SPEAKING
OH I SHOULDNT THINK LYDGATE EVER LOOKED TO PRACTICE FOR A LIVINGSAID MR
 TOLLER WITH A SLIGHT TOUCH OF SARCASM AND THERE THE SUBJECTWAS DROPPED
THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT MR
 FAREBROTHER HAD HEARD HINTS OFLYDGATES EXPENSES BEING OBVIOUSLY TOO GREAT TO BE MET BY HIS PRACTICEBUT HE THOUGHT IT NOT UNLIKELY THAT THERE WERE RESOURCES OREXPECTATIONS WHICH EXCUSED THE LARGE OUTLAY AT THE TIME OF LYDGATESMARRIAGE AND WHICH MIGHT HINDER ANY BAD CONSEQUENCES FROM THEDISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS PRACTICE
 ONE EVENING WHEN HE TOOK THE PAINS TOGO TO MIDDLEMARCH ON PURPOSE TO HAVE A CHAT WITH LYDGATE AS OF OLD HENOTICED IN HIM AN AIR OF EXCITED EFFORT QUITE UNLIKE HIS USUAL EASY WAYOF KEEPING SILENCE OR BREAKING IT WITH ABRUPT ENERGY WHENEVER HE HADANYTHING TO SAY
 LYDGATE TALKED PERSISTENTLY WHEN THEY WERE IN HISWORKROOM PUTTING ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST THE PROBABILITY OF CERTAINBIOLOGICAL VIEWS BUT HE HAD NONE OF THOSE DEFINITE THINGS TO SAY OR TOSHOW WHICH GIVE THE WAYMARKS OF A PATIENT UNINTERRUPTED PURSUIT SUCHAS HE USED HIMSELF TO INSIST ON SAYING THAT THERE MUST BE A SYSTOLEAND DIASTOLE IN ALL INQUIRY AND THAT A MANS MIND MUST BECONTINUALLY EXPANDING AND SHRINKING BETWEEN THE WHOLE HUMAN HORIZON ANDTHE HORIZON OF AN OBJECTGLASS
 THAT EVENING HE SEEMED TO BE TALKINGWIDELY FOR THE SAKE OF RESISTING ANY PERSONAL BEARING AND BEFORE LONGTHEY WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM WHERE LYDGATE HAVING ASKED ROSAMONDTO GIVE THEM MUSIC SANK BACK IN HIS CHAIR IN SILENCE BUT WITH ASTRANGE LIGHT IN HIS EYES
 HE MAY HAVE BEEN TAKING AN OPIATE WAS ATHOUGHT THAT CROSSED MR
 FAREBROTHERS MINDTICDOULOUREUX PERHAPSORMEDICAL WORRIES
IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM THAT LYDGATES MARRIAGE WAS NOT DELIGHTFUL HEBELIEVED AS THE REST DID THAT ROSAMOND WAS AN AMIABLE DOCILECREATURE THOUGH HE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT HER RATHER UNINTERESTINGALITTLE TOO MUCH THE PATTERNCARD OF THE FINISHINGSCHOOL AND HISMOTHER COULD NOT FORGIVE ROSAMOND BECAUSE SHE NEVER SEEMED TO SEE THATHENRIETTA NOBLE WAS IN THE ROOM
 HOWEVER LYDGATE FELL IN LOVE WITHHER SAID THE VICAR TO HIMSELF AND SHE MUST BE TO HIS TASTE
MR
 FAREBROTHER WAS AWARE THAT LYDGATE WAS A PROUD MAN BUT HAVING VERYLITTLE CORRESPONDING FIBRE IN HIMSELF AND PERHAPS TOO LITTLE CAREABOUT PERSONAL DIGNITY EXCEPT THE DIGNITY OF NOT BEING MEAN ORFOOLISH HE COULD HARDLY ALLOW ENOUGH FOR THE WAY IN WHICH LYDGATESHRANK AS FROM A BURN FROM THE UTTERANCE OF ANY WORD ABOUT HISPRIVATE AFFAIRS
 AND SOON AFTER THAT CONVERSATION AT MR
 TOLLERS THEVICAR LEARNED SOMETHING WHICH MADE HIM WATCH THE MORE EAGERLY FOR ANOPPORTUNITY OF INDIRECTLY LETTING LYDGATE KNOW THAT IF HE WANTED TOOPEN HIMSELF ABOUT ANY DIFFICULTY THERE WAS A FRIENDLY EAR READY
THE OPPORTUNITY CAME AT MR
 VINCYS WHERE ON NEW YEARS DAY THEREWAS A PARTY TO WHICH MR
 FAREBROTHER WAS IRRESISTIBLY INVITED ON THEPLEA THAT HE MUST NOT FORSAKE HIS OLD FRIENDS ON THE FIRST NEW YEAR OFHIS BEING A GREATER MAN AND RECTOR AS WELL AS VICAR
 AND THIS PARTYWAS THOROUGHLY FRIENDLY ALL THE LADIES OF THE FAREBROTHER FAMILY WEREPRESENT THE VINCY CHILDREN ALL DINED AT THE TABLE AND FRED HADPERSUADED HIS MOTHER THAT IF SHE DID NOT INVITE MARY GARTH THEFAREBROTHERS WOULD REGARD IT AS A SLIGHT TO THEMSELVES MARY BEINGTHEIR PARTICULAR FRIEND
 MARY CAME AND FRED WAS IN HIGH SPIRITSTHOUGH HIS ENJOYMENT WAS OF A CHECKERED KINDTRIUMPH THAT HIS MOTHERSHOULD SEE MARYS IMPORTANCE WITH THE CHIEF PERSONAGES IN THE PARTYBEING MUCH STREAKED WITH JEALOUSY WHEN MR
 FAREBROTHER SAT DOWN BY HER
FRED USED TO BE MUCH MORE EASY ABOUT HIS OWN ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THEDAYS WHEN HE HAD NOT BEGUN TO DREAD BEING BOWLED OUT BY FAREBROTHERAND THIS TERROR WAS STILL BEFORE HIM
 MRS
 VINCY IN HER FULLESTMATRONLY BLOOM LOOKED AT MARYS LITTLE FIGURE ROUGH WAVY HAIR ANDVISAGE QUITE WITHOUT LILIES AND ROSES AND WONDERED TRYINGUNSUCCESSFULLY TO FANCY HERSELF CARING ABOUT MARYS APPEARANCE INWEDDING CLOTHES OR FEELING COMPLACENCY IN GRANDCHILDREN WHO WOULDFEATURE THE GARTHS
 HOWEVER THE PARTY WAS A MERRY ONE AND MARY WASPARTICULARLY BRIGHT BEING GLAD FOR FREDS SAKE THAT HIS FRIENDS WEREGETTING KINDER TO HER AND BEING ALSO QUITE WILLING THAT THEY SHOULDSEE HOW MUCH SHE WAS VALUED BY OTHERS WHOM THEY MUST ADMIT TO BEJUDGES
MR
 FAREBROTHER NOTICED THAT LYDGATE SEEMED BORED AND THAT MR
 VINCYSPOKE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE TO HIS SONINLAW
 ROSAMOND WAS PERFECTLYGRACEFUL AND CALM AND ONLY A SUBTLE OBSERVATION SUCH AS THE VICAR HADNOT BEEN ROUSED TO BESTOW ON HER WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED THE TOTAL ABSENCEOF THAT INTEREST IN HER HUSBANDS PRESENCE WHICH A LOVING WIFE IS SURETO BETRAY EVEN IF ETIQUETTE KEEPS HER ALOOF FROM HIM
 WHEN LYDGATE WASTAKING PART IN THE CONVERSATION SHE NEVER LOOKED TOWARDS HIM ANY MORETHAN IF SHE HAD BEEN A SCULPTURED PSYCHE MODELLED TO LOOK ANOTHER WAYAND WHEN AFTER BEING CALLED OUT FOR AN HOUR OR TWO HE REENTERED THEROOM SHE SEEMED UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FACT WHICH EIGHTEEN MONTHS BEFOREWOULD HAVE HAD THE EFFECT OF A NUMERAL BEFORE CIPHERS
 IN REALITYHOWEVER SHE WAS INTENSELY AWARE OF LYDGATES VOICE AND MOVEMENTS ANDHER PRETTY GOODTEMPERED AIR OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS WAS A STUDIED NEGATIONBY WHICH SHE SATISFIED HER INWARD OPPOSITION TO HIM WITHOUT COMPROMISEOF PROPRIETY
 WHEN THE LADIES WERE IN THE DRAWINGROOM AFTER LYDGATEHAD BEEN CALLED AWAY FROM THE DESSERT MRS
 FAREBROTHER WHEN ROSAMONDHAPPENED TO BE NEAR HER SAIDYOU HAVE TO GIVE UP A GREAT DEAL OF YOURHUSBANDS SOCIETY MRS
 LYDGATE
YES THE LIFE OF A MEDICAL MAN IS VERY ARDUOUS ESPECIALLY WHEN HE ISSO DEVOTED TO HIS PROFESSION AS MR
 LYDGATE IS SAID ROSAMOND WHO WASSTANDING AND MOVED EASILY AWAY AT THE END OF THIS CORRECT LITTLESPEECH
IT IS DREADFULLY DULL FOR HER WHEN THERE IS NO COMPANY SAID MRS
VINCY WHO WAS SEATED AT THE OLD LADYS SIDE
 I AM SURE I THOUGHT SOWHEN ROSAMOND WAS ILL AND I WAS STAYING WITH HER
 YOU KNOW MRS
FAREBROTHER OURS IS A CHEERFUL HOUSE
 I AM OF A CHEERFUL DISPOSITIONMYSELF AND MR
 VINCY ALWAYS LIKES SOMETHING TO BE GOING ON
 THAT ISWHAT ROSAMOND HAS BEEN USED TO
 VERY DIFFERENT FROM A HUSBAND OUT ATODD HOURS AND NEVER KNOWING WHEN HE WILL COME HOME AND OF A CLOSEPROUD DISPOSITION I THINKINDISCREET MRS
 VINCY DID LOWER HER TONESLIGHTLY WITH THIS PARENTHESIS
 BUT ROSAMOND ALWAYS HAD AN ANGEL OF ATEMPER HER BROTHERS USED VERY OFTEN NOT TO PLEASE HER BUT SHE WASNEVER THE GIRL TO SHOW TEMPER FROM A BABY SHE WAS ALWAYS AS GOOD ASGOOD AND WITH A COMPLEXION BEYOND ANYTHING
 BUT MY CHILDREN ARE ALLGOODTEMPERED THANK GOD
THIS WAS EASILY CREDIBLE TO ANY ONE LOOKING AT MRS
 VINCY AS SHE THREWBACK HER BROAD CAPSTRINGS AND SMILED TOWARDS HER THREE LITTLE GIRLSAGED FROM SEVEN TO ELEVEN
 BUT IN THAT SMILING GLANCE SHE WAS OBLIGEDTO INCLUDE MARY GARTH WHOM THE THREE GIRLS HAD GOT INTO A CORNER TOMAKE HER TELL THEM STORIES
 MARY WAS JUST FINISHING THE DELICIOUS TALEOF RUMPELSTILTSKIN WHICH SHE HAD WELL BY HEART BECAUSE LETTY WASNEVER TIRED OF COMMUNICATING IT TO HER IGNORANT ELDERS FROM A FAVORITERED VOLUME
 LOUISA MRS
 VINCYS DARLING NOW RAN TO HER WITH WIDEEYEDSERIOUS EXCITEMENT CRYING OH MAMMA MAMMA THE LITTLE MAN STAMPED SOHARD ON THE FLOOR HE COULDNT GET HIS LEG OUT AGAIN
BLESS YOU MY CHERUB
 SAID MAMMA YOU SHALL TELL ME ALL ABOUT ITTOMORROW
 GO AND LISTEN
 AND THEN AS HER EYES FOLLOWED LOUISA BACKTOWARDS THE ATTRACTIVE CORNER SHE THOUGHT THAT IF FRED WISHED HER TOINVITE MARY AGAIN SHE WOULD MAKE NO OBJECTION THE CHILDREN BEING SOPLEASED WITH HER
BUT PRESENTLY THE CORNER BECAME STILL MORE ANIMATED FOR MR
FAREBROTHER CAME IN AND SEATING HIMSELF BEHIND LOUISA TOOK HER ON HISLAP WHEREUPON THE GIRLS ALL INSISTED THAT HE MUST HEARRUMPELSTILTSKIN AND MARY MUST TELL IT OVER AGAIN
 HE INSISTED TOO ANDMARY WITHOUT FUSS BEGAN AGAIN IN HER NEAT FASHION WITH PRECISELY THESAME WORDS AS BEFORE
 FRED WHO HAD ALSO SEATED HIMSELF NEAR WOULDHAVE FELT UNMIXED TRIUMPH IN MARYS EFFECTIVENESS IF MR
 FAREBROTHERHAD NOT BEEN LOOKING AT HER WITH EVIDENT ADMIRATION WHILE HEDRAMATIZED AN INTENSE INTEREST IN THE TALE TO PLEASE THE CHILDREN
YOU WILL NEVER CARE ANY MORE ABOUT MY ONEEYED GIANT LOO SAID FREDAT THE END
YES I SHALL
 TELL ABOUT HIM NOW SAID LOUISA
OH I DARE SAY I AM QUITE CUT OUT
 ASK MR
 FAREBROTHER
YES ADDED MARY ASK MR
 FAREBROTHER TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE ANTSWHOSE BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WAS KNOCKED DOWN BY A GIANT NAMED TOM AND HETHOUGHT THEY DIDNT MIND BECAUSE HE COULDNT HEAR THEM CRY OR SEE THEMUSE THEIR POCKETHANDKERCHIEFS
PLEASE SAID LOUISA LOOKING UP AT THE VICAR
NO NO I AM A GRAVE OLD PARSON
 IF I TRY TO DRAW A STORY OUT OF MYBAG A SERMON COMES INSTEAD
 SHALL I PREACH YOU A SERMON
 SAID HEPUTTING ON HIS SHORTSIGHTED GLASSES AND PURSING UP HIS LIPS
YES SAID LOUISA FALTERINGLY
LET ME SEE THEN
 AGAINST CAKES HOW CAKES ARE BAD THINGS ESPECIALLYIF THEY ARE SWEET AND HAVE PLUMS IN THEM
LOUISA TOOK THE AFFAIR RATHER SERIOUSLY AND GOT DOWN FROM THE VICARSKNEE TO GO TO FRED
AH I SEE IT WILL NOT DO TO PREACH ON NEW YEARS DAY SAID MR
FAREBROTHER RISING AND WALKING AWAY
 HE HAD DISCOVERED OF LATE THATFRED HAD BECOME JEALOUS OF HIM AND ALSO THAT HE HIMSELF WAS NOT LOSINGHIS PREFERENCE FOR MARY ABOVE ALL OTHER WOMEN
A DELIGHTFUL YOUNG PERSON IS MISS GARTH SAID MRS
 FAREBROTHER WHOHAD BEEN WATCHING HER SONS MOVEMENTS
YES SAID MRS
 VINCY OBLIGED TO REPLY AS THE OLD LADY TURNED TO HEREXPECTANTLY
 IT IS A PITY SHE IS NOT BETTERLOOKING
I CANNOT SAY THAT SAID MRS
 FAREBROTHER DECISIVELY
 I LIKE HERCOUNTENANCE
 WE MUST NOT ALWAYS ASK FOR BEAUTY WHEN A GOOD GOD HASSEEN FIT TO MAKE AN EXCELLENT YOUNG WOMAN WITHOUT IT
 I PUT GOODMANNERS FIRST AND MISS GARTH WILL KNOW HOW TO CONDUCT HERSELF IN ANYSTATION
THE OLD LADY WAS A LITTLE SHARP IN HER TONE HAVING A PROSPECTIVEREFERENCE TO MARYS BECOMING HER DAUGHTERINLAW FOR THERE WAS THISINCONVENIENCE IN MARYS POSITION WITH REGARD TO FRED THAT IT WAS NOTSUITABLE TO BE MADE PUBLIC AND HENCE THE THREE LADIES AT LOWICKPARSONAGE WERE STILL HOPING THAT CAMDEN WOULD CHOOSE MISS GARTH
NEW VISITORS ENTERED AND THE DRAWINGROOM WAS GIVEN UP TO MUSIC ANDGAMES WHILE WHISTTABLES WERE PREPARED IN THE QUIET ROOM ON THE OTHERSIDE OF THE HALL
 MR
 FAREBROTHER PLAYED A RUBBER TO SATISFY HISMOTHER WHO REGARDED HER OCCASIONAL WHIST AS A PROTEST AGAINST SCANDALAND NOVELTY OF OPINION IN WHICH LIGHT EVEN A REVOKE HAD ITS DIGNITY
BUT AT THE END HE GOT MR
 CHICHELY TO TAKE HIS PLACE AND LEFT THEROOM
 AS HE CROSSED THE HALL LYDGATE HAD JUST COME IN AND WAS TAKINGOFF HIS GREATCOAT
YOU ARE THE MAN I WAS GOING TO LOOK FOR SAID THE VICAR AND INSTEADOF ENTERING THE DRAWINGROOM THEY WALKED ALONG THE HALL AND STOODAGAINST THE FIREPLACE WHERE THE FROSTY AIR HELPED TO MAKE A GLOWINGBANK
 YOU SEE I CAN LEAVE THE WHISTTABLE EASILY ENOUGH HE WENT ONSMILING AT LYDGATE NOW I DONT PLAY FOR MONEY
 I OWE THAT TO YOUMRS
 CASAUBON SAYS
HOW
 SAID LYDGATE COLDLY
AH YOU DIDNT MEAN ME TO KNOW IT I CALL THAT UNGENEROUS RETICENCE
YOU SHOULD LET A MAN HAVE THE PLEASURE OF FEELING THAT YOU HAVE DONEHIM A GOOD TURN
 I DONT ENTER INTO SOME PEOPLES DISLIKE OF BEINGUNDER AN OBLIGATION UPON MY WORD I PREFER BEING UNDER AN OBLIGATIONTO EVERYBODY FOR BEHAVING WELL TO ME
I CANT TELL WHAT YOU MEAN SAID LYDGATE UNLESS IT IS THAT I ONCESPOKE OF YOU TO MRS
 CASAUBON
 BUT I DID NOT THINK THAT SHE WOULD BREAKHER PROMISE NOT TO MENTION THAT I HAD DONE SO SAID LYDGATE LEANINGHIS BACK AGAINST THE CORNER OF THE MANTELPIECE AND SHOWING NORADIANCE IN HIS FACE
IT WAS BROOKE WHO LET IT OUT ONLY THE OTHER DAY
 HE PAID ME THECOMPLIMENT OF SAYING THAT HE WAS VERY GLAD I HAD THE LIVING THOUGH YOUHAD COME ACROSS HIS TACTICS AND HAD PRAISED ME UP AS A KEN AND ATILLOTSON AND THAT SORT OF THING TILL MRS
 CASAUBON WOULD HEAR OF NOONE ELSE
OH BROOKE IS SUCH A LEAKYMINDED FOOL SAID LYDGATE CONTEMPTUOUSLY
WELL I WAS GLAD OF THE LEAKINESS THEN
 I DONT SEE WHY YOU SHOULDNTLIKE ME TO KNOW THAT YOU WISHED TO DO ME A SERVICE MY DEAR FELLOW
 ANDYOU CERTAINLY HAVE DONE ME ONE
 ITS RATHER A STRONG CHECK TO ONESSELFCOMPLACENCY TO FIND HOW MUCH OF ONES RIGHT DOING DEPENDS ON NOTBEING IN WANT OF MONEY
 A MAN WILL NOT BE TEMPTED TO SAY THE LORDSPRAYER BACKWARD TO PLEASE THE DEVIL IF HE DOESNT WANT THE DEVILSSERVICES
 I HAVE NO NEED TO HANG ON THE SMILES OF CHANCE NOW
I DONT SEE THAT THERES ANY MONEYGETTING WITHOUT CHANCE SAIDLYDGATE IF A MAN GETS IT IN A PROFESSION ITS PRETTY SURE TO COME BYCHANCE
MR
 FAREBROTHER THOUGHT HE COULD ACCOUNT FOR THIS SPEECH IN STRIKINGCONTRAST WITH LYDGATES FORMER WAY OF TALKING AS THE PERVERSITY WHICHWILL OFTEN SPRING FROM THE MOODINESS OF A MAN ILL AT EASE IN HISAFFAIRS
 HE ANSWERED IN A TONE OF GOODHUMORED ADMISSIONAH THERES ENORMOUS PATIENCE WANTED WITH THE WAY OF THE WORLD
 BUT ITIS THE EASIER FOR A MAN TO WAIT PATIENTLY WHEN HE HAS FRIENDS WHO LOVEHIM AND ASK FOR NOTHING BETTER THAN TO HELP HIM THROUGH SO FAR AS ITLIES IN THEIR POWER
OH YES SAID LYDGATE IN A CARELESS TONE CHANGING HIS ATTITUDE ANDLOOKING AT HIS WATCH
 PEOPLE MAKE MUCH MORE OF THEIR DIFFICULTIES THANTHEY NEED TO DO
HE KNEW AS DISTINCTLY AS POSSIBLE THAT THIS WAS AN OFFER OF HELP TOHIMSELF FROM MR
 FAREBROTHER AND HE COULD NOT BEAR IT
 SO STRANGELYDETERMINED ARE WE MORTALS THAT AFTER HAVING BEEN LONG GRATIFIED WITHTHE SENSE THAT HE HAD PRIVATELY DONE THE VICAR A SERVICE THESUGGESTION THAT THE VICAR DISCERNED HIS NEED OF A SERVICE IN RETURNMADE HIM SHRINK INTO UNCONQUERABLE RETICENCE
 BESIDES BEHIND ALLMAKING OF SUCH OFFERS WHAT ELSE MUST COME
THAT HE SHOULD MENTION HISCASE IMPLY THAT HE WANTED SPECIFIC THINGS
 AT THAT MOMENT SUICIDESEEMED EASIER
MR
 FAREBROTHER WAS TOO KEEN A MAN NOT TO KNOW THE MEANING OF THATREPLY AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN MASSIVENESS IN LYDGATES MANNER ANDTONE CORRESPONDING WITH HIS PHYSIQUE WHICH IF HE REPELLED YOURADVANCES IN THE FIRST INSTANCE SEEMED TO PUT PERSUASIVE DEVICES OUT OFQUESTION
WHAT TIME ARE YOU
 SAID THE VICAR DEVOURING HIS WOUNDED FEELING
AFTER ELEVEN SAID LYDGATE
 AND THEY WENT INTO THE DRAWINGROOM

    ALL FORCE IS TWAIN IN ONE CAUSE IS NOT CAUSE    UNLESS EFFECT BE THERE AND ACTIONS SELF    MUST NEEDS CONTAIN A PASSIVE
 SO COMMAND    EXISTS BUT WITH OBEDIENCE
EVEN IF LYDGATE HAD BEEN INCLINED TO BE QUITE OPEN ABOUT HIS AFFAIRSHE KNEW THAT IT WOULD HAVE HARDLY BEEN IN MR
 FAREBROTHERS POWER TOGIVE HIM THE HELP HE IMMEDIATELY WANTED
 WITH THE YEARS BILLS COMINGIN FROM HIS TRADESMEN WITH DOVERS THREATENING HOLD ON HIS FURNITUREAND WITH NOTHING TO DEPEND ON BUT SLOW DRIBBLING PAYMENTS FROM PATIENTSWHO MUST NOT BE OFFENDEDFOR THE HANDSOME FEES HE HAD HAD FROM FRESHITTHALL AND LOWICK MANOR HAD BEEN EASILY ABSORBEDNOTHING LESS THAN ATHOUSAND POUNDS WOULD HAVE FREED HIM FROM ACTUAL EMBARRASSMENT ANDLEFT A RESIDUE WHICH ACCORDING TO THE FAVORITE PHRASE OF HOPEFULNESSIN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM TIME TO LOOK ABOUT HIM
NATURALLY THE MERRY CHRISTMAS BRINGING THE HAPPY NEW YEAR WHENFELLOWCITIZENS EXPECT TO BE PAID FOR THE TROUBLE AND GOODS THEY HAVESMILINGLY BESTOWED ON THEIR NEIGHBORS HAD SO TIGHTENED THE PRESSURE OFSORDID CARES ON LYDGATES MIND THAT IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE FOR HIM TOTHINK UNBROKENLY OF ANY OTHER SUBJECT EVEN THE MOST HABITUAL ANDSOLICITING
 HE WAS NOT AN ILLTEMPERED MAN HIS INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITYTHE ARDENT KINDNESS OF HIS HEART AS WELL AS HIS STRONG FRAME WOULDALWAYS UNDER TOLERABLY EASY CONDITIONS HAVE KEPT HIM ABOVE THE PETTYUNCONTROLLED SUSCEPTIBILITIES WHICH MAKE BAD TEMPER
 BUT HE WAS NOW APREY TO THAT WORST IRRITATION WHICH ARISES NOT SIMPLY FROM ANNOYANCESBUT FROM THE SECOND CONSCIOUSNESS UNDERLYING THOSE ANNOYANCES OFWASTED ENERGY AND A DEGRADING PREOCCUPATION WHICH WAS THE REVERSE OFALL HIS FORMER PURPOSES
 THIS IS WHAT I AM THINKING OF AND THATIS WHAT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN THINKING OF WAS THE BITTER INCESSANT MURMURWITHIN HIM MAKING EVERY DIFFICULTY A DOUBLE GOAD TO IMPATIENCE
SOME GENTLEMEN HAVE MADE AN AMAZING FIGURE IN LITERATURE BY GENERALDISCONTENT WITH THE UNIVERSE AS A TRAP OF DULNESS INTO WHICH THEIRGREAT SOULS HAVE FALLEN BY MISTAKE BUT THE SENSE OF A STUPENDOUS SELFAND AN INSIGNIFICANT WORLD MAY HAVE ITS CONSOLATIONS
 LYDGATESDISCONTENT WAS MUCH HARDER TO BEAR IT WAS THE SENSE THAT THERE WAS AGRAND EXISTENCE IN THOUGHT AND EFFECTIVE ACTION LYING AROUND HIM WHILEHIS SELF WAS BEING NARROWED INTO THE MISERABLE ISOLATION OF EGOISTICFEARS AND VULGAR ANXIETIES FOR EVENTS THAT MIGHT ALLAY SUCH FEARS
 HISTROUBLES WILL PERHAPS APPEAR MISERABLY SORDID AND BENEATH THEATTENTION OF LOFTY PERSONS WHO CAN KNOW NOTHING OF DEBT EXCEPT ON AMAGNIFICENT SCALE
 DOUBTLESS THEY WERE SORDID AND FOR THE MAJORITYWHO ARE NOT LOFTY THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM SORDIDNESS BUT BY BEING FREEFROM MONEYCRAVING WITH ALL ITS BASE HOPES AND TEMPTATIONS ITSWATCHING FOR DEATH ITS HINTED REQUESTS ITS HORSEDEALERS DESIRE TOMAKE BAD WORK PASS FOR GOOD ITS SEEKING FOR FUNCTION WHICH OUGHT TO BEANOTHERS ITS COMPULSION OFTEN TO LONG FOR LUCK IN THE SHAPE OF A WIDECALAMITY
IT WAS BECAUSE LYDGATE WRITHED UNDER THE IDEA OF GETTING HIS NECKBENEATH THIS VILE YOKE THAT HE HAD FALLEN INTO A BITTER MOODY STATEWHICH WAS CONTINUALLY WIDENING ROSAMONDS ALIENATION FROM HIM
 AFTERTHE FIRST DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE BILL OF SALE HE HAD MADE MANY EFFORTSTO DRAW HER INTO SYMPATHY WITH HIM ABOUT POSSIBLE MEASURES FORNARROWING THEIR EXPENSES AND WITH THE THREATENING APPROACH OFCHRISTMAS HIS PROPOSITIONS GREW MORE AND MORE DEFINITE
 WE TWO CAN DOWITH ONLY ONE SERVANT AND LIVE ON VERY LITTLE HE SAID AND I SHALLMANAGE WITH ONE HORSE
 FOR LYDGATE AS WE HAVE SEEN HAD BEGUN TOREASON WITH A MORE DISTINCT VISION ABOUT THE EXPENSES OF LIVING ANDANY SHARE OF PRIDE HE HAD GIVEN TO APPEARANCES OF THAT SORT WAS MEAGRECOMPARED WITH THE PRIDE WHICH MADE HIM REVOLT FROM EXPOSURE AS ADEBTOR OR FROM ASKING MEN TO HELP HIM WITH THEIR MONEY
OF COURSE YOU CAN DISMISS THE OTHER TWO SERVANTS IF YOU LIKE SAIDROSAMOND BUT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE VERY INJURIOUS TO YOURPOSITION FOR US TO LIVE IN A POOR WAY
 YOU MUST EXPECT YOUR PRACTICE TOBE LOWERED
MY DEAR ROSAMOND IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF CHOICE
 WE HAVE BEGUN TOOEXPENSIVELY
 PEACOCK YOU KNOW LIVED IN A MUCH SMALLER HOUSE THANTHIS
 IT IS MY FAULT I OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN BETTER AND I DESERVE ATHRASHINGIF THERE WERE ANYBODY WHO HAD A RIGHT TO GIVE IT MEFORBRINGING YOU INTO THE NECESSITY OF LIVING IN A POORER WAY THAN YOU HAVEBEEN USED TO
 BUT WE MARRIED BECAUSE WE LOVED EACH OTHER I SUPPOSE
AND THAT MAY HELP US TO PULL ALONG TILL THINGS GET BETTER
 COME DEARPUT DOWN THAT WORK AND COME TO ME
HE WAS REALLY IN CHILL GLOOM ABOUT HER AT THAT MOMENT BUT HE DREADED AFUTURE WITHOUT AFFECTION AND WAS DETERMINED TO RESIST THE ONCOMING OFDIVISION BETWEEN THEM
 ROSAMOND OBEYED HIM AND HE TOOK HER ON HISKNEE BUT IN HER SECRET SOUL SHE WAS UTTERLY ALOOF FROM HIM
 THE POORTHING SAW ONLY THAT THE WORLD WAS NOT ORDERED TO HER LIKING ANDLYDGATE WAS PART OF THAT WORLD
 BUT HE HELD HER WAIST WITH ONE HAND ANDLAID THE OTHER GENTLY ON BOTH OF HERS FOR THIS RATHER ABRUPT MAN HADMUCH TENDERNESS IN HIS MANNERS TOWARDS WOMEN SEEMING TO HAVE ALWAYSPRESENT IN HIS IMAGINATION THE WEAKNESS OF THEIR FRAMES AND THEDELICATE POISE OF THEIR HEALTH BOTH IN BODY AND MIND
 AND HE BEGANAGAIN TO SPEAK PERSUASIVELY
I FIND NOW I LOOK INTO THINGS A LITTLE ROSY THAT IT IS WONDERFULWHAT AN AMOUNT OF MONEY SLIPS AWAY IN OUR HOUSEKEEPING
 I SUPPOSE THESERVANTS ARE CARELESS AND WE HAVE HAD A GREAT MANY PEOPLE COMING
 BUTTHERE MUST BE MANY IN OUR RANK WHO MANAGE WITH MUCH LESS THEY MUST DOWITH COMMONER THINGS I SUPPOSE AND LOOK AFTER THE SCRAPS
 IT SEEMSMONEY GOES BUT A LITTLE WAY IN THESE MATTERS FOR WRENCH HAS EVERYTHINGAS PLAIN AS POSSIBLE AND HE HAS A VERY LARGE PRACTICE
OH IF YOU THINK OF LIVING AS THE WRENCHES DO
 SAID ROSAMOND WITH ALITTLE TURN OF HER NECK
 BUT I HAVE HEARD YOU EXPRESS YOUR DISGUST ATTHAT WAY OF LIVING
YES THEY HAVE BAD TASTE IN EVERYTHINGTHEY MAKE ECONOMY LOOK UGLY
 WENEEDNT DO THAT
 I ONLY MEANT THAT THEY AVOID EXPENSES ALTHOUGH WRENCHHAS A CAPITAL PRACTICE
WHY SHOULD NOT YOU HAVE A GOOD PRACTICE TERTIUS
 MR
 PEACOCK HAD
 YOUSHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL NOT TO OFFEND PEOPLE AND YOU SHOULD SEND OUTMEDICINES AS THE OTHERS DO
 I AM SURE YOU BEGAN WELL AND YOU GOTSEVERAL GOOD HOUSES
 IT CANNOT ANSWER TO BE ECCENTRIC YOU SHOULD THINKWHAT WILL BE GENERALLY LIKED SAID ROSAMOND IN A DECIDED LITTLE TONEOF ADMONITION
LYDGATES ANGER ROSE HE WAS PREPARED TO BE INDULGENT TOWARDS FEMININEWEAKNESS BUT NOT TOWARDS FEMININE DICTATION
 THE SHALLOWNESS OF AWATERNIXIES SOUL MAY HAVE A CHARM UNTIL SHE BECOMES DIDACTIC
 BUT HECONTROLLED HIMSELF AND ONLY SAID WITH A TOUCH OF DESPOTIC FIRMNESSWHAT I AM TO DO IN MY PRACTICE ROSY IT IS FOR ME TO JUDGE
 THAT ISNOT THE QUESTION BETWEEN US
 IT IS ENOUGH FOR YOU TO KNOW THAT OURINCOME IS LIKELY TO BE A VERY NARROW ONEHARDLY FOUR HUNDRED PERHAPSLESS FOR A LONG TIME TO COME AND WE MUST TRY TO REARRANGE OUR LIVESIN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT FACT
ROSAMOND WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT OR TWO LOOKING BEFORE HER AND THENSAID MY UNCLE BULSTRODE OUGHT TO ALLOW YOU A SALARY FOR THE TIME YOUGIVE TO THE HOSPITAL IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD WORK FORNOTHING
IT WAS UNDERSTOOD FROM THE BEGINNING THAT MY SERVICES WOULD BEGRATUITOUS
 THAT AGAIN NEED NOT ENTER INTO OUR DISCUSSION
 I HAVEPOINTED OUT WHAT IS THE ONLY PROBABILITY SAID LYDGATE IMPATIENTLY
THEN CHECKING HIMSELF HE WENT ON MORE QUIETLYI THINK I SEE ONE RESOURCE WHICH WOULD FREE US FROM A GOOD DEAL OF THEPRESENT DIFFICULTY
 I HEAR THAT YOUNG NED PLYMDALE IS GOING TO BEMARRIED TO MISS SOPHY TOLLER
 THEY ARE RICH AND IT IS NOT OFTEN THAT AGOOD HOUSE IS VACANT IN MIDDLEMARCH
 I FEEL SURE THAT THEY WOULD BEGLAD TO TAKE THIS HOUSE FROM US WITH MOST OF OUR FURNITURE AND THEYWOULD BE WILLING TO PAY HANDSOMELY FOR THE LEASE
 I CAN EMPLOY TRUMBULLTO SPEAK TO PLYMDALE ABOUT IT
ROSAMOND LEFT HER HUSBANDS KNEE AND WALKED SLOWLY TO THE OTHER END OFTHE ROOM WHEN SHE TURNED ROUND AND WALKED TOWARDS HIM IT WAS EVIDENTTHAT THE TEARS HAD COME AND THAT SHE WAS BITING HER UNDERLIP ANDCLASPING HER HANDS TO KEEP HERSELF FROM CRYING
 LYDGATE WASWRETCHEDSHAKEN WITH ANGER AND YET FEELING THAT IT WOULD BE UNMANLY TOVENT THE ANGER JUST NOW
I AM VERY SORRY ROSAMOND I KNOW THIS IS PAINFUL
I THOUGHT AT LEAST WHEN I HAD BORNE TO SEND THE PLATE BACK AND HAVETHAT MAN TAKING AN INVENTORY OF THE FURNITUREI SHOULD HAVE THOUGHTTHAT WOULD SUFFICE
I EXPLAINED IT TO YOU AT THE TIME DEAR
 THAT WAS ONLY A SECURITY ANDBEHIND THAT SECURITY THERE IS A DEBT
 AND THAT DEBT MUST BE PAID WITHINTHE NEXT FEW MONTHS ELSE WE SHALL HAVE OUR FURNITURE SOLD
 IF YOUNGPLYMDALE WILL TAKE OUR HOUSE AND MOST OF OUR FURNITURE WE SHALL BEABLE TO PAY THAT DEBT AND SOME OTHERS TOO AND WE SHALL BE QUIT OF APLACE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR US
 WE MIGHT TAKE A SMALLER HOUSE TRUMBULL IKNOW HAS A VERY DECENT ONE TO LET AT THIRTY POUNDS AYEAR AND THIS ISNINETY
 LYDGATE UTTERED THIS SPEECH IN THE CURT HAMMERING WAY WITHWHICH WE USUALLY TRY TO NAIL DOWN A VAGUE MIND TO IMPERATIVE FACTS
TEARS ROLLED SILENTLY DOWN ROSAMONDS CHEEKS SHE JUST PRESSED HERHANDKERCHIEF AGAINST THEM AND STOOD LOOKING AT THE LARGE VASE ON THEMANTELPIECE
 IT WAS A MOMENT OF MORE INTENSE BITTERNESS THAN SHE HADEVER FELT BEFORE
 AT LAST SHE SAID WITHOUT HURRY AND WITH CAREFULEMPHASISI NEVER COULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ACT IN THAT WAY
LIKE IT
 BURST OUT LYDGATE RISING FROM HIS CHAIR THRUSTING HISHANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND STALKING AWAY FROM THE HEARTH ITS NOT AQUESTION OF LIKING
 OF COURSE I DONT LIKE IT ITS THE ONLY THING ICAN DO
 HE WHEELED ROUND THERE AND TURNED TOWARDS HER
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THERE WERE MANY OTHER MEANS THAN THAT SAIDROSAMOND
 LET US HAVE A SALE AND LEAVE MIDDLEMARCH ALTOGETHER
TO DO WHAT
 WHAT IS THE USE OF MY LEAVING MY WORK IN MIDDLEMARCH TO GOWHERE I HAVE NONE
 WE SHOULD BE JUST AS PENNILESS ELSEWHERE AS WE AREHERE SAID LYDGATE STILL MORE ANGRILY
IF WE ARE TO BE IN THAT POSITION IT WILL BE ENTIRELY YOUR OWN DOINGTERTIUS SAID ROSAMOND TURNING ROUND TO SPEAK WITH THE FULLESTCONVICTION
 YOU WILL NOT BEHAVE AS YOU OUGHT TO DO TO YOUR OWN FAMILY
YOU OFFENDED CAPTAIN LYDGATE
 SIR GODWIN WAS VERY KIND TO ME WHEN WEWERE AT QUALLINGHAM AND I AM SURE IF YOU SHOWED PROPER REGARD TO HIMAND TOLD HIM YOUR AFFAIRS HE WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR YOU
 BUT RATHERTHAN THAT YOU LIKE GIVING UP OUR HOUSE AND FURNITURE TO MR
 NEDPLYMDALE
THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE FIERCENESS IN LYDGATES EYES AS HE ANSWEREDWITH NEW VIOLENCE WELL THEN IF YOU WILL HAVE IT SO I DO LIKE IT
 IADMIT THAT I LIKE IT BETTER THAN MAKING A FOOL OF MYSELF BY GOING TOBEG WHERE ITS OF NO USE
 UNDERSTAND THEN THAT IT IS WHAT I LIKE TODO
THERE WAS A TONE IN THE LAST SENTENCE WHICH WAS EQUIVALENT TO THECLUTCH OF HIS STRONG HAND ON ROSAMONDS DELICATE ARM
 BUT FOR ALL THATHIS WILL WAS NOT A WHIT STRONGER THAN HERS
 SHE IMMEDIATELY WALKED OUTOF THE ROOM IN SILENCE BUT WITH AN INTENSE DETERMINATION TO HINDERWHAT LYDGATE LIKED TO DO
HE WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE BUT AS HIS BLOOD COOLED HE FELT THAT THECHIEF RESULT OF THE DISCUSSION WAS A DEPOSIT OF DREAD WITHIN HIM AT THEIDEA OF OPENING WITH HIS WIFE IN FUTURE SUBJECTS WHICH MIGHT AGAIN URGEHIM TO VIOLENT SPEECH
 IT WAS AS IF A FRACTURE IN DELICATE CRYSTAL HADBEGUN AND HE WAS AFRAID OF ANY MOVEMENT THAT MIGHT MAKE IT FATAL
 HISMARRIAGE WOULD BE A MERE PIECE OF BITTER IRONY IF THEY COULD NOT GO ONLOVING EACH OTHER
 HE HAD LONG AGO MADE UP HIS MIND TO WHAT HE THOUGHTWAS HER NEGATIVE CHARACTERHER WANT OF SENSIBILITY WHICH SHOWED ITSELFIN DISREGARD BOTH OF HIS SPECIFIC WISHES AND OF HIS GENERAL AIMS
 THEFIRST GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT HAD BEEN BORNE THE TENDER DEVOTEDNESS ANDDOCILE ADORATION OF THE IDEAL WIFE MUST BE RENOUNCED AND LIFE MUST BETAKEN UP ON A LOWER STAGE OF EXPECTATION AS IT IS BY MEN WHO HAVE LOSTTHEIR LIMBS
 BUT THE REAL WIFE HAD NOT ONLY HER CLAIMS SHE HAD STILL AHOLD ON HIS HEART AND IT WAS HIS INTENSE DESIRE THAT THE HOLD SHOULDREMAIN STRONG
 IN MARRIAGE THE CERTAINTY SHE WILL NEVER LOVE MEMUCH IS EASIER TO BEAR THAN THE FEAR I SHALL LOVE HER NO MORE
HENCE AFTER THAT OUTBURST HIS INWARD EFFORT WAS ENTIRELY TO EXCUSEHER AND TO BLAME THE HARD CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WERE PARTLY HIS FAULT
HE TRIED THAT EVENING BY PETTING HER TO HEAL THE WOUND HE HAD MADE INTHE MORNING AND IT WAS NOT IN ROSAMONDS NATURE TO BE REPELLENT ORSULKY INDEED SHE WELCOMED THE SIGNS THAT HER HUSBAND LOVED HER ANDWAS UNDER CONTROL
 BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING QUITE DISTINCT FROM LOVINGHIM
 LYDGATE WOULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN SOON TO RECUR TO THE PLAN OFPARTING WITH THE HOUSE HE WAS RESOLVED TO CARRY IT OUT AND SAY ASLITTLE MORE ABOUT IT AS POSSIBLE
 BUT ROSAMOND HERSELF TOUCHED ON IT ATBREAKFAST BY SAYING MILDLYHAVE YOU SPOKEN TO TRUMBULL YET
NO SAID LYDGATE BUT I SHALL CALL ON HIM AS I GO BY THIS MORNING
NO TIME MUST BE LOST
 HE TOOK ROSAMONDS QUESTION AS A SIGN THAT SHEWITHDREW HER INWARD OPPOSITION AND KISSED HER HEAD CARESSINGLY WHEN HEGOT UP TO GO AWAY
AS SOON AS IT WAS LATE ENOUGH TO MAKE A CALL ROSAMOND WENT TO MRS
PLYMDALE MR
 NEDS MOTHER AND ENTERED WITH PRETTY CONGRATULATIONSINTO THE SUBJECT OF THE COMING MARRIAGE
 MRS
 PLYMDALES MATERNAL VIEWWAS THAT ROSAMOND MIGHT POSSIBLY NOW HAVE RETROSPECTIVE GLIMPSES OFHER OWN FOLLY AND FEELING THE ADVANTAGES TO BE AT PRESENT ALL ON THESIDE OF HER SON WAS TOO KIND A WOMAN NOT TO BEHAVE GRACIOUSLY
YES NED IS MOST HAPPY I MUST SAY
 AND SOPHY TOLLER IS ALL I COULDDESIRE IN A DAUGHTERINLAW
 OF COURSE HER FATHER IS ABLE TO DOSOMETHING HANDSOME FOR HERTHAT IS ONLY WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED WITH ABREWERY LIKE HIS
 AND THE CONNECTION IS EVERYTHING WE SHOULD DESIRE
BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT I LOOK AT
 SHE IS SUCH A VERY NICE GIRLNO AIRSNO PRETENSIONS THOUGH ON A LEVEL WITH THE FIRST
 I DONT MEAN WITH THETITLED ARISTOCRACY
 I SEE VERY LITTLE GOOD IN PEOPLE AIMING OUT OFTHEIR OWN SPHERE
 I MEAN THAT SOPHY IS EQUAL TO THE BEST IN THE TOWNAND SHE IS CONTENTED WITH THAT
I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT HER VERY AGREEABLE SAID ROSAMOND
I LOOK UPON IT AS A REWARD FOR NED WHO NEVER HELD HIS HEAD TOO HIGHTHAT HE SHOULD HAVE GOT INTO THE VERY BEST CONNECTION CONTINUED MRS
PLYMDALE HER NATIVE SHARPNESS SOFTENED BY A FERVID SENSE THAT SHE WASTAKING A CORRECT VIEW
 AND SUCH PARTICULAR PEOPLE AS THE TOLLERS ARETHEY MIGHT HAVE OBJECTED BECAUSE SOME OF OUR FRIENDS ARE NOT THEIRS
 ITIS WELL KNOWN THAT YOUR AUNT BULSTRODE AND I HAVE BEEN INTIMATE FROMOUR YOUTH AND MR
 PLYMDALE HAS BEEN ALWAYS ON MR
 BULSTRODES SIDE
AND I MYSELF PREFER SERIOUS OPINIONS
 BUT THE TOLLERS HAVE WELCOMED NEDALL THE SAME
I AM SURE HE IS A VERY DESERVING WELLPRINCIPLED YOUNG MAN SAIDROSAMOND WITH A NEAT AIR OF PATRONAGE IN RETURN FOR MRS
 PLYMDALESWHOLESOME CORRECTIONS
OH HE HAS NOT THE STYLE OF A CAPTAIN IN THE ARMY OR THAT SORT OFCARRIAGE AS IF EVERYBODY WAS BENEATH HIM OR THAT SHOWY KIND OFTALKING AND SINGING AND INTELLECTUAL TALENT
 BUT I AM THANKFUL HE HASNOT
 IT IS A POOR PREPARATION BOTH FOR HERE AND HEREAFTER
OH DEAR YES APPEARANCES HAVE VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH HAPPINESS SAIDROSAMOND
 I THINK THERE IS EVERY PROSPECT OF THEIR BEING A HAPPYCOUPLE
 WHAT HOUSE WILL THEY TAKE
OH AS FOR THAT THEY MUST PUT UP WITH WHAT THEY CAN GET
 THEY HAVEBEEN LOOKING AT THE HOUSE IN ST
 PETERS PLACE NEXT TO MR
 HACKBUTTSIT BELONGS TO HIM AND HE IS PUTTING IT NICELY IN REPAIR
 I SUPPOSETHEY ARE NOT LIKELY TO HEAR OF A BETTER
 INDEED I THINK NED WILLDECIDE THE MATTER TODAY
I SHOULD THINK IT IS A NICE HOUSE I LIKE ST
 PETERS PLACE
WELL IT IS NEAR THE CHURCH AND A GENTEEL SITUATION
 BUT THE WINDOWSARE NARROW AND IT IS ALL UPS AND DOWNS
 YOU DONT HAPPEN TO KNOW OFANY OTHER THAT WOULD BE AT LIBERTY
 SAID MRS
 PLYMDALE FIXING HERROUND BLACK EYES ON ROSAMOND WITH THE ANIMATION OF A SUDDEN THOUGHT INTHEM
OH NO I HEAR SO LITTLE OF THOSE THINGS
ROSAMOND HAD NOT FORESEEN THAT QUESTION AND ANSWER IN SETTING OUT TOPAY HER VISIT SHE HAD SIMPLY MEANT TO GATHER ANY INFORMATION WHICHWOULD HELP HER TO AVERT THE PARTING WITH HER OWN HOUSE UNDERCIRCUMSTANCES THOROUGHLY DISAGREEABLE TO HER
 AS TO THE UNTRUTH IN HERREPLY SHE NO MORE REFLECTED ON IT THAN SHE DID ON THE UNTRUTH THEREWAS IN HER SAYING THAT APPEARANCES HAD VERY LITTLE TO DO WITHHAPPINESS
 HER OBJECT SHE WAS CONVINCED WAS THOROUGHLY JUSTIFIABLEIT WAS LYDGATE WHOSE INTENTION WAS INEXCUSABLE AND THERE WAS A PLAN INHER MIND WHICH WHEN SHE HAD CARRIED IT OUT FULLY WOULD PROVE HOW VERYFALSE A STEP IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR HIM TO HAVE DESCENDED FROM HISPOSITION
SHE RETURNED HOME BY MR
 BORTHROP TRUMBULLS OFFICE MEANING TO CALLTHERE
 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE THAT ROSAMOND HAD THOUGHT OFDOING ANYTHING IN THE FORM OF BUSINESS BUT SHE FELT EQUAL TO THEOCCASION
 THAT SHE SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO DO WHAT SHE INTENSELY DISLIKEDWAS AN IDEA WHICH TURNED HER QUIET TENACITY INTO ACTIVE INVENTION
 HEREWAS A CASE IN WHICH IT COULD NOT BE ENOUGH SIMPLY TO DISOBEY AND BESERENELY PLACIDLY OBSTINATE SHE MUST ACT ACCORDING TO HER JUDGMENTAND SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT HER JUDGMENT WAS RIGHTINDEED IF IT HADNOT BEEN SHE WOULD NOT HAVE WISHED TO ACT ON IT
MR
 TRUMBULL WAS IN THE BACKROOM OF HIS OFFICE AND RECEIVED ROSAMONDWITH HIS FINEST MANNERS NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE HAD MUCH SENSIBILITY TOHER CHARMS BUT BECAUSE THE GOODNATURED FIBRE IN HIM WAS STIRRED BYHIS CERTAINTY THAT LYDGATE WAS IN DIFFICULTIES AND THAT THISUNCOMMONLY PRETTY WOMANTHIS YOUNG LADY WITH THE HIGHEST PERSONALATTRACTIONSWAS LIKELY TO FEEL THE PINCH OF TROUBLETO FIND HERSELFINVOLVED IN CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND HER CONTROL
 HE BEGGED HER TO DO HIMTHE HONOR TO TAKE A SEAT AND STOOD BEFORE HER TRIMMING AND COMPORTINGHIMSELF WITH AN EAGER SOLICITUDE WHICH WAS CHIEFLY BENEVOLENT
ROSAMONDS FIRST QUESTION WAS WHETHER HER HUSBAND HAD CALLED ON MR
TRUMBULL THAT MORNING TO SPEAK ABOUT DISPOSING OF THEIR HOUSE
YES MAAM YES HE DID HE DID SO SAID THE GOOD AUCTIONEER TRYINGTO THROW SOMETHING SOOTHING INTO HIS ITERATION
 I WAS ABOUT TO FULFILHIS ORDER IF POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON
 HE WISHED ME NOT TOPROCRASTINATE
I CALLED TO TELL YOU NOT TO GO ANY FURTHER MR
 TRUMBULL AND I BEG OFYOU NOT TO MENTION WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ON THE SUBJECT
 WILL YOU OBLIGEME
CERTAINLY I WILL MRS
 LYDGATE CERTAINLY
 CONFIDENCE IS SACRED WITHME ON BUSINESS OR ANY OTHER TOPIC
 I AM THEN TO CONSIDER THE COMMISSIONWITHDRAWN
 SAID MR
 TRUMBULL ADJUSTING THE LONG ENDS OF HIS BLUECRAVAT WITH BOTH HANDS AND LOOKING AT ROSAMOND DEFERENTIALLY
YES IF YOU PLEASE
 I FIND THAT MR
 NED PLYMDALE HAS TAKEN A HOUSETHEONE IN ST
 PETERS PLACE NEXT TO MR
 HACKBUTTS
 MR
 LYDGATE WOULD BEANNOYED THAT HIS ORDERS SHOULD BE FULFILLED USELESSLY
 AND BESIDESTHAT THERE ARE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH RENDER THE PROPOSALUNNECESSARY
VERY GOOD MRS
 LYDGATE VERY GOOD
 I AM AT YOUR COMMANDS WHENEVERYOU REQUIRE ANY SERVICE OF ME SAID MR
 TRUMBULL WHO FELT PLEASURE INCONJECTURING THAT SOME NEW RESOURCES HAD BEEN OPENED
 RELY ON ME IBEG
 THE AFFAIR SHALL GO NO FURTHER
THAT EVENING LYDGATE WAS A LITTLE COMFORTED BY OBSERVING THAT ROSAMONDWAS MORE LIVELY THAN SHE HAD USUALLY BEEN OF LATE AND EVEN SEEMEDINTERESTED IN DOING WHAT WOULD PLEASE HIM WITHOUT BEING ASKED
 HETHOUGHT IF SHE WILL BE HAPPY AND I CAN RUB THROUGH WHAT DOES IT ALLSIGNIFY
 IT IS ONLY A NARROW SWAMP THAT WE HAVE TO PASS IN A LONGJOURNEY
 IF I CAN GET MY MIND CLEAR AGAIN I SHALL DO
HE WAS SO MUCH CHEERED THAT HE BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR AN ACCOUNT OFEXPERIMENTS WHICH HE HAD LONG AGO MEANT TO LOOK UP AND HAD NEGLECTEDOUT OF THAT CREEPING SELFDESPAIR WHICH COMES IN THE TRAIN OF PETTYANXIETIES
 HE FELT AGAIN SOME OF THE OLD DELIGHTFUL ABSORPTION IN AFARREACHING INQUIRY WHILE ROSAMOND PLAYED THE QUIET MUSIC WHICH WASAS HELPFUL TO HIS MEDITATION AS THE PLASH OF AN OAR ON THE EVENINGLAKE
 IT WAS RATHER LATE HE HAD PUSHED AWAY ALL THE BOOKS AND WASLOOKING AT THE FIRE WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED BEHIND HIS HEAD INFORGETFULNESS OF EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEWCONTROLLING EXPERIMENT WHEN ROSAMOND WHO HAD LEFT THE PIANO AND WASLEANING BACK IN HER CHAIR WATCHING HIM SAIDMR
 NED PLYMDALE HAS TAKEN A HOUSE ALREADY
LYDGATE STARTLED AND JARRED LOOKED UP IN SILENCE FOR A MOMENT LIKE AMAN WHO HAS BEEN DISTURBED IN HIS SLEEP
 THEN FLUSHING WITH ANUNPLEASANT CONSCIOUSNESS HE ASKEDHOW DO YOU KNOW
I CALLED AT MRS
 PLYMDALES THIS MORNING AND SHE TOLD ME THAT HE HADTAKEN THE HOUSE IN ST
 PETERS PLACE NEXT TO MR
 HACKBUTTS
LYDGATE WAS SILENT
 HE DREW HIS HANDS FROM BEHIND HIS HEAD AND PRESSEDTHEM AGAINST THE HAIR WHICH WAS HANGING AS IT WAS APT TO DO IN A MASSON HIS FOREHEAD WHILE HE RESTED HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES
 HE WASFEELING BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT AS IF HE HAD OPENED A DOOR OUT OF ASUFFOCATING PLACE AND HAD FOUND IT WALLED UP BUT HE ALSO FELT SURETHAT ROSAMOND WAS PLEASED WITH THE CAUSE OF HIS DISAPPOINTMENT
 HEPREFERRED NOT LOOKING AT HER AND NOT SPEAKING UNTIL HE HAD GOT OVERTHE FIRST SPASM OF VEXATION
 AFTER ALL HE SAID IN HIS BITTERNESS WHATCAN A WOMAN CARE ABOUT SO MUCH AS HOUSE AND FURNITURE
 A HUSBANDWITHOUT THEM IS AN ABSURDITY
 WHEN HE LOOKED UP AND PUSHED HIS HAIRASIDE HIS DARK EYES HAD A MISERABLE BLANK NONEXPECTANCE OF SYMPATHYIN THEM BUT HE ONLY SAID COOLLYPERHAPS SOME ONE ELSE MAY TURN UP
 I TOLD TRUMBULL TO BE ON THELOOKOUT IF HE FAILED WITH PLYMDALE
ROSAMOND MADE NO REMARK
 SHE TRUSTED TO THE CHANCE THAT NOTHING MOREWOULD PASS BETWEEN HER HUSBAND AND THE AUCTIONEER UNTIL SOME ISSUESHOULD HAVE JUSTIFIED HER INTERFERENCE AT ANY RATE SHE HAD HINDEREDTHE EVENT WHICH SHE IMMEDIATELY DREADED
 AFTER A PAUSE SHE SAIDHOW MUCH MONEY IS IT THAT THOSE DISAGREEABLE PEOPLE WANT
WHAT DISAGREEABLE PEOPLE
THOSE WHO TOOK THE LISTAND THE OTHERS
 I MEAN HOW MUCH MONEY WOULDSATISFY THEM SO THAT YOU NEED NOT BE TROUBLED ANY MORE
LYDGATE SURVEYED HER FOR A MOMENT AS IF HE WERE LOOKING FOR SYMPTOMSAND THEN SAID OH IF I COULD HAVE GOT SIX HUNDRED FROM PLYMDALE FORFURNITURE AND AS PREMIUM I MIGHT HAVE MANAGED
 I COULD HAVE PAID OFFDOVER AND GIVEN ENOUGH ON ACCOUNT TO THE OTHERS TO MAKE THEM WAITPATIENTLY IF WE CONTRACTED OUR EXPENSES
BUT I MEAN HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU WANT IF WE STAYED IN THIS HOUSE
MORE THAN I AM LIKELY TO GET ANYWHERE SAID LYDGATE WITH RATHER AGRATING SARCASM IN HIS TONE
 IT ANGERED HIM TO PERCEIVE THAT ROSAMONDSMIND WAS WANDERING OVER IMPRACTICABLE WISHES INSTEAD OF FACING POSSIBLEEFFORTS
WHY SHOULD YOU NOT MENTION THE SUM
 SAID ROSAMOND WITH A MILDINDICATION THAT SHE DID NOT LIKE HIS MANNERS
WELL SAID LYDGATE IN A GUESSING TONE IT WOULD TAKE AT LEAST ATHOUSAND TO SET ME AT EASE
 BUT HE ADDED INCISIVELY I HAVE TOCONSIDER WHAT I SHALL DO WITHOUT IT NOT WITH IT
ROSAMOND SAID NO MORE
BUT THE NEXT DAY SHE CARRIED OUT HER PLAN OF WRITING TO SIR GODWINLYDGATE
 SINCE THE CAPTAINS VISIT SHE HAD RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HIMAND ALSO ONE FROM MRS
 MENGAN HIS MARRIED SISTER CONDOLING WITH HERON THE LOSS OF HER BABY AND EXPRESSING VAGUELY THE HOPE THAT THEYSHOULD SEE HER AGAIN AT QUALLINGHAM
 LYDGATE HAD TOLD HER THAT THISPOLITENESS MEANT NOTHING BUT SHE WAS SECRETLY CONVINCED THAT ANYBACKWARDNESS IN LYDGATES FAMILY TOWARDS HIM WAS DUE TO HIS COLD ANDCONTEMPTUOUS BEHAVIOR AND SHE HAD ANSWERED THE LETTERS IN HER MOSTCHARMING MANNER FEELING SOME CONFIDENCE THAT A SPECIFIC INVITATIONWOULD FOLLOW
 BUT THERE HAD BEEN TOTAL SILENCE
 THE CAPTAIN EVIDENTLYWAS NOT A GREAT PENMAN AND ROSAMOND REFLECTED THAT THE SISTERS MIGHTHAVE BEEN ABROAD
 HOWEVER THE SEASON WAS COME FOR THINKING OF FRIENDSAT HOME AND AT ANY RATE SIR GODWIN WHO HAD CHUCKED HER UNDER THECHIN AND PRONOUNCED HER TO BE LIKE THE CELEBRATED BEAUTY MRS
 CROLYWHO HAD MADE A CONQUEST OF HIM IN  WOULD BE TOUCHED BY ANY APPEALFROM HER AND WOULD FIND IT PLEASANT FOR HER SAKE TO BEHAVE AS HE OUGHTTO DO TOWARDS HIS NEPHEW
 ROSAMOND WAS NAIVELY CONVINCED OF WHAT AN OLDGENTLEMAN OUGHT TO DO TO PREVENT HER FROM SUFFERING ANNOYANCE
 AND SHEWROTE WHAT SHE CONSIDERED THE MOST JUDICIOUS LETTER POSSIBLEONE WHICHWOULD STRIKE SIR GODWIN AS A PROOF OF HER EXCELLENT SENSEPOINTING OUTHOW DESIRABLE IT WAS THAT TERTIUS SHOULD QUIT SUCH A PLACE ASMIDDLEMARCH FOR ONE MORE FITTED TO HIS TALENTS HOW THE UNPLEASANTCHARACTER OF THE INHABITANTS HAD HINDERED HIS PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS ANDHOW IN CONSEQUENCE HE WAS IN MONEY DIFFICULTIES FROM WHICH IT WOULDREQUIRE A THOUSAND POUNDS THOROUGHLY TO EXTRICATE HIM
 SHE DID NOT SAYTHAT TERTIUS WAS UNAWARE OF HER INTENTION TO WRITE FOR SHE HAD THEIDEA THAT HIS SUPPOSED SANCTION OF HER LETTER WOULD BE IN ACCORDANCEWITH WHAT SHE DID SAY OF HIS GREAT REGARD FOR HIS UNCLE GODWIN AS THERELATIVE WHO HAD ALWAYS BEEN HIS BEST FRIEND
 SUCH WAS THE FORCE OFPOOR ROSAMONDS TACTICS NOW SHE APPLIED THEM TO AFFAIRS
THIS HAD HAPPENED BEFORE THE PARTY ON NEW YEARS DAY AND NO ANSWER HADYET COME FROM SIR GODWIN
 BUT ON THE MORNING OF THAT DAY LYDGATE HAD TOLEARN THAT ROSAMOND HAD REVOKED HIS ORDER TO BORTHROP TRUMBULL
 FEELINGIT NECESSARY THAT SHE SHOULD BE GRADUALLY ACCUSTOMED TO THE IDEA OFTHEIR QUITTING THE HOUSE IN LOWICK GATE HE OVERCAME HIS RELUCTANCE TOSPEAK TO HER AGAIN ON THE SUBJECT AND WHEN THEY WERE BREAKFASTINGSAIDI SHALL TRY TO SEE TRUMBULL THIS MORNING AND TELL HIM TO ADVERTISETHE HOUSE IN THE PIONEER AND THE TRUMPET
 IF THE THING WEREADVERTISED SOME ONE MIGHT BE INCLINED TO TAKE IT WHO WOULD NOTOTHERWISE HAVE THOUGHT OF A CHANGE
 IN THESE COUNTRY PLACES MANY PEOPLEGO ON IN THEIR OLD HOUSES WHEN THEIR FAMILIES ARE TOO LARGE FOR THEMFOR WANT OF KNOWING WHERE THEY CAN FIND ANOTHER
 AND TRUMBULL SEEMS TOHAVE GOT NO BITE AT ALL
ROSAMOND KNEW THAT THE INEVITABLE MOMENT WAS COME
 I ORDERED TRUMBULLNOT TO INQUIRE FURTHER SHE SAID WITH A CAREFUL CALMNESS WHICH WASEVIDENTLY DEFENSIVE
LYDGATE STARED AT HER IN MUTE AMAZEMENT
 ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HEHAD BEEN FASTENING UP HER PLAITS FOR HER AND TALKING THE LITTLELANGUAGE OF AFFECTION WHICH ROSAMOND THOUGH NOT RETURNING ITACCEPTED AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A SERENE AND LOVELY IMAGE NOW AND THENMIRACULOUSLY DIMPLING TOWARDS HER VOTARY
 WITH SUCH FIBRES STILL ASTIRIN HIM THE SHOCK HE RECEIVED COULD NOT AT ONCE BE DISTINCTLY ANGER ITWAS CONFUSED PAIN
 HE LAID DOWN THE KNIFE AND FORK WITH WHICH HE WASCARVING AND THROWING HIMSELF BACK IN HIS CHAIR SAID AT LAST WITH ACOOL IRONY IN HIS TONEMAY I ASK WHEN AND WHY YOU DID SO
WHEN I KNEW THAT THE PLYMDALES HAD TAKEN A HOUSE I CALLED TO TELL HIMNOT TO MENTION OURS TO THEM AND AT THE SAME TIME I TOLD HIM NOT TO LETTHE AFFAIR GO ON ANY FURTHER
 I KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE VERY INJURIOUS TOYOU IF IT WERE KNOWN THAT YOU WISHED TO PART WITH YOUR HOUSE ANDFURNITURE AND I HAD A VERY STRONG OBJECTION TO IT
 I THINK THAT WASREASON ENOUGH
IT WAS OF NO CONSEQUENCE THEN THAT I HAD TOLD YOU IMPERATIVE REASONSOF ANOTHER KIND OF NO CONSEQUENCE THAT I HAD COME TO A DIFFERENTCONCLUSION AND GIVEN AN ORDER ACCORDINGLY
 SAID LYDGATE BITINGLYTHE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING GATHERING ABOUT HIS BROW AND EYES
THE EFFECT OF ANY ONES ANGER ON ROSAMOND HAD ALWAYS BEEN TO MAKE HERSHRINK IN COLD DISLIKE AND TO BECOME ALL THE MORE CALMLY CORRECT INTHE CONVICTION THAT SHE WAS NOT THE PERSON TO MISBEHAVE WHATEVER OTHERSMIGHT DO
 SHE REPLIEDI THINK I HAD A PERFECT RIGHT TO SPEAK ON A SUBJECT WHICH CONCERNS MEAT LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU
CLEARLYYOU HAD A RIGHT TO SPEAK BUT ONLY TO ME
 YOU HAD NO RIGHT TOCONTRADICT MY ORDERS SECRETLY AND TREAT ME AS IF I WERE A FOOL SAIDLYDGATE IN THE SAME TONE AS BEFORE
 THEN WITH SOME ADDED SCORN IS ITPOSSIBLE TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE
 IS IT OFANY USE FOR ME TO TELL YOU AGAIN WHY WE MUST TRY TO PART WITH THEHOUSE
IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR YOU TO TELL ME AGAIN SAID ROSAMOND IN AVOICE THAT FELL AND TRICKLED LIKE COLD WATERDROPS
 I REMEMBERED WHATYOU SAID
 YOU SPOKE JUST AS VIOLENTLY AS YOU DO NOW
 BUT THAT DOES NOTALTER MY OPINION THAT YOU OUGHT TO TRY EVERY OTHER MEANS RATHER THANTAKE A STEP WHICH IS SO PAINFUL TO ME
 AND AS TO ADVERTISING THE HOUSEI THINK IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY DEGRADING TO YOU
AND SUPPOSE I DISREGARD YOUR OPINION AS YOU DISREGARD MINE
YOU CAN DO SO OF COURSE
 BUT I THINK YOU OUGHT TO HAVE TOLD ME BEFOREWE WERE MARRIED THAT YOU WOULD PLACE ME IN THE WORST POSITION RATHERTHAN GIVE UP YOUR OWN WILL
LYDGATE DID NOT SPEAK BUT TOSSED HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND TWITCHEDTHE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH IN DESPAIR
 ROSAMOND SEEING THAT HE WAS NOTLOOKING AT HER ROSE AND SET HIS CUP OF COFFEE BEFORE HIM BUT HE TOOKNO NOTICE OF IT AND WENT ON WITH AN INWARD DRAMA AND ARGUMENTOCCASIONALLY MOVING IN HIS SEAT RESTING ONE ARM ON THE TABLE ANDRUBBING HIS HAND AGAINST HIS HAIR
 THERE WAS A CONFLUX OF EMOTIONS ANDTHOUGHTS IN HIM THAT WOULD NOT LET HIM EITHER GIVE THOROUGH WAY TO HISANGER OR PERSEVERE WITH SIMPLE RIGIDITY OF RESOLVE
 ROSAMOND TOOKADVANTAGE OF HIS SILENCE
WHEN WE WERE MARRIED EVERYONE FELT THAT YOUR POSITION WAS VERY HIGH
 ICOULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED THEN THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO SELL OUR FURNITUREAND TAKE A HOUSE IN BRIDE STREET WHERE THE ROOMS ARE LIKE CAGES
 IF WEARE TO LIVE IN THAT WAY LET US AT LEAST LEAVE MIDDLEMARCH
THESE WOULD BE VERY STRONG CONSIDERATIONS SAID LYDGATE HALFIRONICALLYSTILL THERE WAS A WITHERED PALENESS ABOUT HIS LIPS AS HELOOKED AT HIS COFFEE AND DID NOT DRINKTHESE WOULD BE VERY STRONGCONSIDERATIONS IF I DID NOT HAPPEN TO BE IN DEBT
MANY PERSONS MUST HAVE BEEN IN DEBT IN THE SAME WAY BUT IF THEY ARERESPECTABLE PEOPLE TRUST THEM
 I AM SURE I HAVE HEARD PAPA SAY THATTHE TORBITS WERE IN DEBT AND THEY WENT ON VERY WELL
 IT CANNOT BE GOODTO ACT RASHLY SAID ROSAMOND WITH SERENE WISDOM
LYDGATE SAT PARALYZED BY OPPOSING IMPULSES SINCE NO REASONING HE COULDAPPLY TO ROSAMOND SEEMED LIKELY TO CONQUER HER ASSENT HE WANTED TOSMASH AND GRIND SOME OBJECT ON WHICH HE COULD AT LEAST PRODUCE ANIMPRESSION OR ELSE TO TELL HER BRUTALLY THAT HE WAS MASTER AND SHEMUST OBEY
 BUT HE NOT ONLY DREADED THE EFFECT OF SUCH EXTREMITIES ONTHEIR MUTUAL LIFEHE HAD A GROWING DREAD OF ROSAMONDS QUIET ELUSIVEOBSTINACY WHICH WOULD NOT ALLOW ANY ASSERTION OF POWER TO BE FINALAND AGAIN SHE HAD TOUCHED HIM IN A SPOT OF KEENEST FEELING BY IMPLYINGTHAT SHE HAD BEEN DELUDED WITH A FALSE VISION OF HAPPINESS IN MARRYINGHIM
 AS TO SAYING THAT HE WAS MASTER IT WAS NOT THE FACT
 THE VERYRESOLUTION TO WHICH HE HAD WROUGHT HIMSELF BY DINT OF LOGIC ANDHONORABLE PRIDE WAS BEGINNING TO RELAX UNDER HER TORPEDO CONTACT
 HESWALLOWED HALF HIS CUP OF COFFEE AND THEN ROSE TO GO
I MAY AT LEAST REQUEST THAT YOU WILL NOT GO TO TRUMBULL ATPRESENTUNTIL IT HAS BEEN SEEN THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER MEANS SAIDROSAMOND
 ALTHOUGH SHE WAS NOT SUBJECT TO MUCH FEAR SHE FELT IT SAFERNOT TO BETRAY THAT SHE HAD WRITTEN TO SIR GODWIN
 PROMISE ME THAT YOUWILL NOT GO TO HIM FOR A FEW WEEKS OR WITHOUT TELLING ME
LYDGATE GAVE A SHORT LAUGH
 I THINK IT IS I WHO SHOULD EXACT A PROMISETHAT YOU WILL DO NOTHING WITHOUT TELLING ME HE SAID TURNING HIS EYESSHARPLY UPON HER AND THEN MOVING TO THE DOOR
YOU REMEMBER THAT WE ARE GOING TO DINE AT PAPAS SAID ROSAMONDWISHING THAT HE SHOULD TURN AND MAKE A MORE THOROUGH CONCESSION TO HER
BUT HE ONLY SAID OH YES IMPATIENTLY AND WENT AWAY
 SHE HELD IT TOBE VERY ODIOUS IN HIM THAT HE DID NOT THINK THE PAINFUL PROPOSITIONS HEHAD HAD TO MAKE TO HER WERE ENOUGH WITHOUT SHOWING SO UNPLEASANT ATEMPER
 AND WHEN SHE PUT THE MODERATE REQUEST THAT HE WOULD DEFER GOINGTO TRUMBULL AGAIN IT WAS CRUEL IN HIM NOT TO ASSURE HER OF WHAT HEMEANT TO DO
 SHE WAS CONVINCED OF HER HAVING ACTED IN EVERY WAY FOR THEBEST AND EACH GRATING OR ANGRY SPEECH OF LYDGATES SERVED ONLY AS ANADDITION TO THE REGISTER OF OFFENCES IN HER MIND
 POOR ROSAMOND FORMONTHS HAD BEGUN TO ASSOCIATE HER HUSBAND WITH FEELINGS OFDISAPPOINTMENT AND THE TERRIBLY INFLEXIBLE RELATION OF MARRIAGE HADLOST ITS CHARM OF ENCOURAGING DELIGHTFUL DREAMS
 IT HAD FREED HER FROMTHE DISAGREEABLES OF HER FATHERS HOUSE BUT IT HAD NOT GIVEN HEREVERYTHING THAT SHE HAD WISHED AND HOPED
 THE LYDGATE WITH WHOM SHE HADBEEN IN LOVE HAD BEEN A GROUP OF AIRY CONDITIONS FOR HER MOST OF WHICHHAD DISAPPEARED WHILE THEIR PLACE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY EVERYDAY DETAILSWHICH MUST BE LIVED THROUGH SLOWLY FROM HOUR TO HOUR NOT FLOATEDTHROUGH WITH A RAPID SELECTION OF FAVORABLE ASPECTS
 THE HABITS OFLYDGATES PROFESSION HIS HOME PREOCCUPATION WITH SCIENTIFIC SUBJECTSWHICH SEEMED TO HER ALMOST LIKE A MORBID VAMPIRES TASTE HIS PECULIARVIEWS OF THINGS WHICH HAD NEVER ENTERED INTO THE DIALOGUE OFCOURTSHIPALL THESE CONTINUALLY ALIENATING INFLUENCES EVEN WITHOUT THEFACT OF HIS HAVING PLACED HIMSELF AT A DISADVANTAGE IN THE TOWN ANDWITHOUT THAT FIRST SHOCK OF REVELATION ABOUT DOVERS DEBT WOULD HAVEMADE HIS PRESENCE DULL TO HER
 THERE WAS ANOTHER PRESENCE WHICH EVERSINCE THE EARLY DAYS OF HER MARRIAGE UNTIL FOUR MONTHS AGO HAD BEENAN AGREEABLE EXCITEMENT BUT THAT WAS GONE ROSAMOND WOULD NOT CONFESSTO HERSELF HOW MUCH THE CONSEQUENT BLANK HAD TO DO WITH HER UTTERENNUI AND IT SEEMED TO HER PERHAPS SHE WAS RIGHT THAT AN INVITATIONTO QUALLINGHAM AND AN OPENING FOR LYDGATE TO SETTLE ELSEWHERE THAN INMIDDLEMARCHIN LONDON OR SOMEWHERE LIKELY TO BE FREE FROMUNPLEASANTNESSWOULD SATISFY HER QUITE WELL AND MAKE HER INDIFFERENTTO THE ABSENCE OF WILL LADISLAW TOWARDS WHOM SHE FELT SOME RESENTMENTFOR HIS EXALTATION OF MRS
 CASAUBON
THAT WAS THE STATE OF THINGS WITH LYDGATE AND ROSAMOND ON THE NEWYEARS DAY WHEN THEY DINED AT HER FATHERS SHE LOOKING MILDLY NEUTRALTOWARDS HIM IN REMEMBRANCE OF HIS ILLTEMPERED BEHAVIOR AT BREAKFASTAND HE CARRYING A MUCH DEEPER EFFECT FROM THE INWARD CONFLICT IN WHICHTHAT MORNING SCENE WAS ONLY ONE OF MANY EPOCHS
 HIS FLUSHED EFFORTWHILE TALKING TO MR
 FAREBROTHERHIS EFFORT AFTER THE CYNICAL PRETENCETHAT ALL WAYS OF GETTING MONEY ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AND THATCHANCE HAS AN EMPIRE WHICH REDUCES CHOICE TO A FOOLS ILLUSIONWAS BUTTHE SYMPTOM OF A WAVERING RESOLVE A BENUMBED RESPONSE TO THE OLDSTIMULI OF ENTHUSIASM
WHAT WAS HE TO DO
 HE SAW EVEN MORE KEENLY THAN ROSAMOND DID THEDREARINESS OF TAKING HER INTO THE SMALL HOUSE IN BRIDE STREET WHERESHE WOULD HAVE SCANTY FURNITURE AROUND HER AND DISCONTENT WITHIN ALIFE OF PRIVATION AND LIFE WITH ROSAMOND WERE TWO IMAGES WHICH HADBECOME MORE AND MORE IRRECONCILABLE EVER SINCE THE THREAT OF PRIVATIONHAD DISCLOSED ITSELF
 BUT EVEN IF HIS RESOLVES HAD FORCED THE TWOIMAGES INTO COMBINATION THE USEFUL PRELIMINARIES TO THAT HARD CHANGEWERE NOT VISIBLY WITHIN REACH
 AND THOUGH HE HAD NOT GIVEN THE PROMISEWHICH HIS WIFE HAD ASKED FOR HE DID NOT GO AGAIN TO TRUMBULL
 HE EVENBEGAN TO THINK OF TAKING A RAPID JOURNEY TO THE NORTH AND SEEING SIRGODWIN
 HE HAD ONCE BELIEVED THAT NOTHING WOULD URGE HIM INTO MAKING ANAPPLICATION FOR MONEY TO HIS UNCLE BUT HE HAD NOT THEN KNOWN THE FULLPRESSURE OF ALTERNATIVES YET MORE DISAGREEABLE
 HE COULD NOT DEPEND ONTHE EFFECT OF A LETTER IT WAS ONLY IN AN INTERVIEW HOWEVERDISAGREEABLE THIS MIGHT BE TO HIMSELF THAT HE COULD GIVE A THOROUGHEXPLANATION AND COULD TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF KINSHIP
 NO SOONER HADLYDGATE BEGUN TO REPRESENT THIS STEP TO HIMSELF AS THE EASIEST THANTHERE WAS A REACTION OF ANGER THAT HEHE WHO HAD LONG AGO DETERMINED TOLIVE ALOOF FROM SUCH ABJECT CALCULATIONS SUCH SELFINTERESTED ANXIETYABOUT THE INCLINATIONS AND THE POCKETS OF MEN WITH WHOM HE HAD BEENPROUD TO HAVE NO AIMS IN COMMONSHOULD HAVE FALLEN NOT SIMPLY TO THEIRLEVEL BUT TO THE LEVEL OF SOLICITING THEM
CHAPTER LXV
ONE OF US TWO MUST BOWEN DOUTELESSAND SITH A MAN IS MORE REASONABLETHAN WOMAN IS YE MEN MOSTE BE SUFFRABLE
CHAUCER CANTERBURY TALES
THE BIAS OF HUMAN NATURE TO BE SLOW IN CORRESPONDENCE TRIUMPHS EVENOVER THE PRESENT QUICKENING IN THE GENERAL PACE OF THINGS WHAT WONDERTHEN THAT IN  OLD SIR GODWIN LYDGATE WAS SLOW TO WRITE A LETTERWHICH WAS OF CONSEQUENCE TO OTHERS RATHER THAN TO HIMSELF
 NEARLY THREEWEEKS OF THE NEW YEAR WERE GONE AND ROSAMOND AWAITING AN ANSWER TOHER WINNING APPEAL WAS EVERY DAY DISAPPOINTED
 LYDGATE IN TOTALIGNORANCE OF HER EXPECTATIONS WAS SEEING THE BILLS COME IN ANDFEELING THAT DOVERS USE OF HIS ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER CREDITORS WASIMMINENT
 HE HAD NEVER MENTIONED TO ROSAMOND HIS BROODING PURPOSE OFGOING TO QUALLINGHAM HE DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT WHAT WOULD APPEAR TO HERA CONCESSION TO HER WISHES AFTER INDIGNANT REFUSAL UNTIL THE LASTMOMENT BUT HE WAS REALLY EXPECTING TO SET OFF SOON
 A SLICE OF THERAILWAY WOULD ENABLE HIM TO MANAGE THE WHOLE JOURNEY AND BACK IN FOURDAYS
BUT ONE MORNING AFTER LYDGATE HAD GONE OUT A LETTER CAME ADDRESSED TOHIM WHICH ROSAMOND SAW CLEARLY TO BE FROM SIR GODWIN
 SHE WAS FULL OFHOPE
 PERHAPS THERE MIGHT BE A PARTICULAR NOTE TO HER ENCLOSED BUTLYDGATE WAS NATURALLY ADDRESSED ON THE QUESTION OF MONEY OR OTHER AIDAND THE FACT THAT HE WAS WRITTEN TO NAY THE VERY DELAY IN WRITING ATALL SEEMED TO CERTIFY THAT THE ANSWER WAS THOROUGHLY COMPLIANT
 SHEWAS TOO MUCH EXCITED BY THESE THOUGHTS TO DO ANYTHING BUT LIGHTSTITCHING IN A WARM CORNER OF THE DININGROOM WITH THE OUTSIDE OF THISMOMENTOUS LETTER LYING ON THE TABLE BEFORE HER
 ABOUT TWELVE SHE HEARDHER HUSBANDS STEP IN THE PASSAGE AND TRIPPING TO OPEN THE DOOR SHESAID IN HER LIGHTEST TONES TERTIUS COME IN HEREHERE IS A LETTER FORYOU
AH
 HE SAID NOT TAKING OFF HIS HAT BUT JUST TURNING HER ROUNDWITHIN HIS ARM TO WALK TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE THE LETTER LAY
 MY UNCLEGODWIN
 HE EXCLAIMED WHILE ROSAMOND RESEATED HERSELF AND WATCHED HIMAS HE OPENED THE LETTER
 SHE HAD EXPECTED HIM TO BE SURPRISED
WHILE LYDGATES EYES GLANCED RAPIDLY OVER THE BRIEF LETTER SHE SAW HISFACE USUALLY OF A PALE BROWN TAKING ON A DRY WHITENESS WITH NOSTRILSAND LIPS QUIVERING HE TOSSED DOWN THE LETTER BEFORE HER AND SAIDVIOLENTLYIT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ENDURE LIFE WITH YOU IF YOU WILL ALWAYS BEACTING SECRETLYACTING IN OPPOSITION TO ME AND HIDING YOUR ACTIONS
HE CHECKED HIS SPEECH AND TURNED HIS BACK ON HERTHEN WHEELED ROUND ANDWALKED ABOUT SAT DOWN AND GOT UP AGAIN RESTLESSLY GRASPING HARD THEOBJECTS DEEP DOWN IN HIS POCKETS
 HE WAS AFRAID OF SAYING SOMETHINGIRREMEDIABLY CRUEL
ROSAMOND TOO HAD CHANGED COLOR AS SHE READ
 THE LETTER RAN IN THISWAYDEAR TERTIUSDONT SET YOUR WIFE TO WRITE TO ME WHEN YOU HAVEANYTHING TO ASK
 IT IS A ROUNDABOUT WHEEDLING SORT OF THING WHICH ISHOULD NOT HAVE CREDITED YOU WITH
 I NEVER CHOOSE TO WRITE TO A WOMANON MATTERS OF BUSINESS
 AS TO MY SUPPLYING YOU WITH A THOUSAND POUNDSOR ONLY HALF THAT SUM I CAN DO NOTHING OF THE SORT
 MY OWN FAMILYDRAINS ME TO THE LAST PENNY
 WITH TWO YOUNGER SONS AND THREE DAUGHTERSI AM NOT LIKELY TO HAVE CASH TO SPARE
 YOU SEEM TO HAVE GOT THROUGHYOUR OWN MONEY PRETTY QUICKLY AND TO HAVE MADE A MESS WHERE YOU ARETHE SOONER YOU GO SOMEWHERE ELSE THE BETTER
 BUT I HAVE NOTHING TO DOWITH MEN OF YOUR PROFESSION AND CANT HELP YOU THERE
 I DID THE BEST ICOULD FOR YOU AS GUARDIAN AND LET YOU HAVE YOUR OWN WAY IN TAKING TOMEDICINE
 YOU MIGHT HAVE GONE INTO THE ARMY OR THE CHURCH
 YOUR MONEYWOULD HAVE HELD OUT FOR THAT AND THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SURER LADDERBEFORE YOU
 YOUR UNCLE CHARLES HAS HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST YOU FOR NOTGOING INTO HIS PROFESSION BUT NOT I
 I HAVE ALWAYS WISHED YOU WELLBUT YOU MUST CONSIDER YOURSELF ON YOUR OWN LEGS ENTIRELY NOW
YOUR AFFECTIONATE UNCLEGODWIN LYDGATE
WHEN ROSAMOND HAD FINISHED READING THE LETTER SHE SAT QUITE STILL WITHHER HANDS FOLDED BEFORE HER RESTRAINING ANY SHOW OF HER KEENDISAPPOINTMENT AND INTRENCHING HERSELF IN QUIET PASSIVITY UNDER HERHUSBANDS WRATH
 LYDGATE PAUSED IN HIS MOVEMENTS LOOKED AT HER AGAINAND SAID WITH BITING SEVERITYWILL THIS BE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE YOU OF THE HARM YOU MAY DO BY SECRETMEDDLING
 HAVE YOU SENSE ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE NOW YOUR INCOMPETENCE TOJUDGE AND ACT FOR METO INTERFERE WITH YOUR IGNORANCE IN AFFAIRS WHICHIT BELONGS TO ME TO DECIDE ON
THE WORDS WERE HARD BUT THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT LYDGATE HADBEEN FRUSTRATED BY HER
 SHE DID NOT LOOK AT HIM AND MADE NO REPLY
I HAD NEARLY RESOLVED ON GOING TO QUALLINGHAM
 IT WOULD HAVE COST MEPAIN ENOUGH TO DO IT YET IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OF SOME USE
 BUT IT HASBEEN OF NO USE FOR ME TO THINK OF ANYTHING
 YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEENCOUNTERACTING ME SECRETLY
 YOU DELUDE ME WITH A FALSE ASSENT AND THENI AM AT THE MERCY OF YOUR DEVICES
 IF YOU MEAN TO RESIST EVERY WISH IEXPRESS SAY SO AND DEFY ME
 I SHALL AT LEAST KNOW WHAT I AM DOINGTHEN
IT IS A TERRIBLE MOMENT IN YOUNG LIVES WHEN THE CLOSENESS OF LOVESBOND HAS TURNED TO THIS POWER OF GALLING
 IN SPITE OF ROSAMONDSSELFCONTROL A TEAR FELL SILENTLY AND ROLLED OVER HER LIPS
 SHE STILLSAID NOTHING BUT UNDER THAT QUIETUDE WAS HIDDEN AN INTENSE EFFECT SHEWAS IN SUCH ENTIRE DISGUST WITH HER HUSBAND THAT SHE WISHED SHE HADNEVER SEEN HIM
 SIR GODWINS RUDENESS TOWARDS HER AND UTTER WANT OFFEELING RANGED HIM WITH DOVER AND ALL OTHER CREDITORSDISAGREEABLEPEOPLE WHO ONLY THOUGHT OF THEMSELVES AND DID NOT MIND HOW ANNOYINGTHEY WERE TO HER
 EVEN HER FATHER WAS UNKIND AND MIGHT HAVE DONE MOREFOR THEM
 IN FACT THERE WAS BUT ONE PERSON IN ROSAMONDS WORLD WHOM SHEDID NOT REGARD AS BLAMEWORTHY AND THAT WAS THE GRACEFUL CREATURE WITHBLOND PLAITS AND WITH LITTLE HANDS CROSSED BEFORE HER WHO HAD NEVEREXPRESSED HERSELF UNBECOMINGLY AND HAD ALWAYS ACTED FOR THE BESTTHEBEST NATURALLY BEING WHAT SHE BEST LIKED
LYDGATE PAUSING AND LOOKING AT HER BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HALFMADDENINGSENSE OF HELPLESSNESS WHICH COMES OVER PASSIONATE PEOPLE WHEN THEIRPASSION IS MET BY AN INNOCENTLOOKING SILENCE WHOSE MEEK VICTIMIZED AIRSEEMS TO PUT THEM IN THE WRONG AND AT LAST INFECTS EVEN THE JUSTESTINDIGNATION WITH A DOUBT OF ITS JUSTICE
 HE NEEDED TO RECOVER THE FULLSENSE THAT HE WAS IN THE RIGHT BY MODERATING HIS WORDS
CAN YOU NOT SEE ROSAMOND HE BEGAN AGAIN TRYING TO BE SIMPLY GRAVEAND NOT BITTER THAT NOTHING CAN BE SO FATAL AS A WANT OF OPENNESS ANDCONFIDENCE BETWEEN US
 IT HAS HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT I HAVEEXPRESSED A DECIDED WISH AND YOU HAVE SEEMED TO ASSENT YET AFTER THATYOU HAVE SECRETLY DISOBEYED MY WISH
 IN THAT WAY I CAN NEVER KNOW WHATI HAVE TO TRUST TO
 THERE WOULD BE SOME HOPE FOR US IF YOU WOULD ADMITTHIS
 AM I SUCH AN UNREASONABLE FURIOUS BRUTE
 WHY SHOULD YOU NOT BEOPEN WITH ME
 STILL SILENCE
WILL YOU ONLY SAY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN AND THAT I MAY DEPENDON YOUR NOT ACTING SECRETLY IN FUTURE
 SAID LYDGATE URGENTLY BUTWITH SOMETHING OF REQUEST IN HIS TONE WHICH ROSAMOND WAS QUICK TOPERCEIVE
 SHE SPOKE WITH COOLNESS
I CANNOT POSSIBLY MAKE ADMISSIONS OR PROMISES IN ANSWER TO SUCH WORDSAS YOU HAVE USED TOWARDS ME
 I HAVE NOT BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LANGUAGE OFTHAT KIND
 YOU HAVE SPOKEN OF MY SECRET MEDDLING AND MY INTERFERINGIGNORANCE AND MY FALSE ASSENT
 I HAVE NEVER EXPRESSED MYSELF INTHAT WAY TO YOU AND I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO APOLOGIZE
 YOU SPOKE OFITS BEING IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE WITH ME
 CERTAINLY YOU HAVE NOT MADE MYLIFE PLEASANT TO ME OF LATE
 I THINK IT WAS TO BE EXPECTED THAT ISHOULD TRY TO AVERT SOME OF THE HARDSHIPS WHICH OUR MARRIAGE HASBROUGHT ON ME
 ANOTHER TEAR FELL AS ROSAMOND CEASED SPEAKING AND SHEPRESSED IT AWAY AS QUIETLY AS THE FIRST
LYDGATE FLUNG HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR FEELING CHECKMATED
 WHAT PLACE WASTHERE IN HER MIND FOR A REMONSTRANCE TO LODGE IN
 HE LAID DOWN HIS HATFLUNG AN ARM OVER THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED DOWN FOR SOMEMOMENTS WITHOUT SPEAKING
 ROSAMOND HAD THE DOUBLE PURCHASE OVER HIM OFINSENSIBILITY TO THE POINT OF JUSTICE IN HIS REPROACH AND OFSENSIBILITY TO THE UNDENIABLE HARDSHIPS NOW PRESENT IN HER MARRIEDLIFE
 ALTHOUGH HER DUPLICITY IN THE AFFAIR OF THE HOUSE HAD EXCEEDEDWHAT HE KNEW AND HAD REALLY HINDERED THE PLYMDALES FROM KNOWING OF ITSHE HAD NO CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HER ACTION COULD RIGHTLY BE CALLED FALSE
WE ARE NOT OBLIGED TO IDENTIFY OUR OWN ACTS ACCORDING TO A STRICTCLASSIFICATION ANY MORE THAN THE MATERIALS OF OUR GROCERY AND CLOTHES
ROSAMOND FELT THAT SHE WAS AGGRIEVED AND THAT THIS WAS WHAT LYDGATEHAD TO RECOGNIZE
AS FOR HIM THE NEED OF ACCOMMODATING HIMSELF TO HER NATURE WHICH WASINFLEXIBLE IN PROPORTION TO ITS NEGATIONS HELD HIM AS WITH PINCERS
 HEHAD BEGUN TO HAVE AN ALARMED FORESIGHT OF HER IRREVOCABLE LOSS OF LOVEFOR HIM AND THE CONSEQUENT DREARINESS OF THEIR LIFE
 THE READY FULNESSOF HIS EMOTIONS MADE THIS DREAD ALTERNATE QUICKLY WITH THE FIRSTVIOLENT MOVEMENTS OF HIS ANGER
 IT WOULD ASSUREDLY HAVE BEEN A VAINBOAST IN HIM TO SAY THAT HE WAS HER MASTER
YOU HAVE NOT MADE MY LIFE PLEASANT TO ME OF LATETHE HARDSHIPS WHICHOUR MARRIAGE HAS BROUGHT ON METHESE WORDS WERE STINGING HISIMAGINATION AS A PAIN MAKES AN EXAGGERATED DREAM
 IF HE WERE NOT ONLYTO SINK FROM HIS HIGHEST RESOLVE BUT TO SINK INTO THE HIDEOUSFETTERING OF DOMESTIC HATE
ROSAMOND HE SAID TURNING HIS EYES ON HER WITH A MELANCHOLY LOOKYOU SHOULD ALLOW FOR A MANS WORDS WHEN HE IS DISAPPOINTED ANDPROVOKED
 YOU AND I CANNOT HAVE OPPOSITE INTERESTS
 I CANNOT PART MYHAPPINESS FROM YOURS
 IF I AM ANGRY WITH YOU IT IS THAT YOU SEEM NOTTO SEE HOW ANY CONCEALMENT DIVIDES US
 HOW COULD I WISH TO MAKEANYTHING HARD TO YOU EITHER BY MY WORDS OR CONDUCT
 WHEN I HURT YOU IHURT PART OF MY OWN LIFE
 I SHOULD NEVER BE ANGRY WITH YOU IF YOU WOULDBE QUITE OPEN WITH ME
I HAVE ONLY WISHED TO PREVENT YOU FROM HURRYING US INTO WRETCHEDNESSWITHOUT ANY NECESSITY SAID ROSAMOND THE TEARS COMING AGAIN FROM ASOFTENED FEELING NOW THAT HER HUSBAND HAD SOFTENED
 IT IS SO VERY HARDTO BE DISGRACED HERE AMONG ALL THE PEOPLE WE KNOW AND TO LIVE IN SUCHA MISERABLE WAY
 I WISH I HAD DIED WITH THE BABY
SHE SPOKE AND WEPT WITH THAT GENTLENESS WHICH MAKES SUCH WORDS ANDTEARS OMNIPOTENT OVER A LOVINGHEARTED MAN
 LYDGATE DREW HIS CHAIR NEARTO HERS AND PRESSED HER DELICATE HEAD AGAINST HIS CHEEK WITH HISPOWERFUL TENDER HAND
 HE ONLY CARESSED HER HE DID NOT SAY ANYTHINGFOR WHAT WAS THERE TO SAY
 HE COULD NOT PROMISE TO SHIELD HER FROM THEDREADED WRETCHEDNESS FOR HE COULD SEE NO SURE MEANS OF DOING SO
 WHENHE LEFT HER TO GO OUT AGAIN HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IT WAS TEN TIMESHARDER FOR HER THAN FOR HIM HE HAD A LIFE AWAY FROM HOME AND CONSTANTAPPEALS TO HIS ACTIVITY ON BEHALF OF OTHERS
 HE WISHED TO EXCUSEEVERYTHING IN HER IF HE COULDBUT IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT IN THATEXCUSING MOOD HE SHOULD THINK OF HER AS IF SHE WERE AN ANIMAL OFANOTHER AND FEEBLER SPECIES
 NEVERTHELESS SHE HAD MASTERED HIM
CHAPTER LXVI
TIS ONE THING TO BE TEMPTED ESCALUSANOTHER THING TO FALL
MEASURE FOR MEASURE
LYDGATE CERTAINLY HAD GOOD REASON TO REFLECT ON THE SERVICE HISPRACTICE DID HIM IN COUNTERACTING HIS PERSONAL CARES
 HE HAD NO LONGERFREE ENERGY ENOUGH FOR SPONTANEOUS RESEARCH AND SPECULATIVE THINKINGBUT BY THE BEDSIDE OF PATIENTS THE DIRECT EXTERNAL CALLS ON HISJUDGMENT AND SYMPATHIES BROUGHT THE ADDED IMPULSE NEEDED TO DRAW HIMOUT OF HIMSELF
 IT WAS NOT SIMPLY THAT BENEFICENT HARNESS OF ROUTINEWHICH ENABLES SILLY MEN TO LIVE RESPECTABLY AND UNHAPPY MEN TO LIVECALMLYIT WAS A PERPETUAL CLAIM ON THE IMMEDIATE FRESH APPLICATION OFTHOUGHT AND ON THE CONSIDERATION OF ANOTHERS NEED AND TRIAL
 MANY OFUS LOOKING BACK THROUGH LIFE WOULD SAY THAT THE KINDEST MAN WE HAVEEVER KNOWN HAS BEEN A MEDICAL MAN OR PERHAPS THAT SURGEON WHOSE FINETACT DIRECTED BY DEEPLY INFORMED PERCEPTION HAS COME TO US IN OURNEED WITH A MORE SUBLIME BENEFICENCE THAN THAT OF MIRACLEWORKERS
 SOMEOF THAT TWICEBLESSED MERCY WAS ALWAYS WITH LYDGATE IN HIS WORK AT THEHOSPITAL OR IN PRIVATE HOUSES SERVING BETTER THAN ANY OPIATE TO QUIETAND SUSTAIN HIM UNDER HIS ANXIETIES AND HIS SENSE OF MENTAL DEGENERACY
MR
 FAREBROTHERS SUSPICION AS TO THE OPIATE WAS TRUE HOWEVER
 UNDERTHE FIRST GALLING PRESSURE OF FORESEEN DIFFICULTIES AND THE FIRSTPERCEPTION THAT HIS MARRIAGE IF IT WERE NOT TO BE A YOKED LONELINESSMUST BE A STATE OF EFFORT TO GO ON LOVING WITHOUT TOO MUCH CARE ABOUTBEING LOVED HE HAD ONCE OR TWICE TRIED A DOSE OF OPIUM
 BUT HE HAD NOHEREDITARY CONSTITUTIONAL CRAVING AFTER SUCH TRANSIENT ESCAPES FROM THEHAUNTINGS OF MISERY
 HE WAS STRONG COULD DRINK A GREAT DEAL OF WINEBUT DID NOT CARE ABOUT IT AND WHEN THE MEN ROUND HIM WERE DRINKINGSPIRITS HE TOOK SUGAR AND WATER HAVING A CONTEMPTUOUS PITY EVEN FORTHE EARLIEST STAGES OF EXCITEMENT FROM DRINK
 IT WAS THE SAME WITHGAMBLING
 HE HAD LOOKED ON AT A GREAT DEAL OF GAMBLING IN PARISWATCHING IT AS IF IT HAD BEEN A DISEASE
 HE WAS NO MORE TEMPTED BY SUCHWINNING THAN HE WAS BY DRINK
 HE HAD SAID TO HIMSELF THAT THE ONLYWINNING HE CARED FOR MUST BE ATTAINED BY A CONSCIOUS PROCESS OF HIGHDIFFICULT COMBINATION TENDING TOWARDS A BENEFICENT RESULT
 THE POWER HELONGED FOR COULD NOT BE REPRESENTED BY AGITATED FINGERS CLUTCHING AHEAP OF COIN OR BY THE HALFBARBAROUS HALFIDIOTIC TRIUMPH IN THEEYES OF A MAN WHO SWEEPS WITHIN HIS ARMS THE VENTURES OF TWENTYCHAPFALLEN COMPANIONS
BUT JUST AS HE HAD TRIED OPIUM SO HIS THOUGHT NOW BEGAN TO TURN UPONGAMBLINGNOT WITH APPETITE FOR ITS EXCITEMENT BUT WITH A SORT OFWISTFUL INWARD GAZE AFTER THAT EASY WAY OF GETTING MONEY WHICH IMPLIEDNO ASKING AND BROUGHT NO RESPONSIBILITY
 IF HE HAD BEEN IN LONDON ORPARIS AT THAT TIME IT IS PROBABLE THAT SUCH THOUGHTS SECONDED BYOPPORTUNITY WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM INTO A GAMBLINGHOUSE NO LONGER TOWATCH THE GAMBLERS BUT TO WATCH WITH THEM IN KINDRED EAGERNESS
REPUGNANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN SURMOUNTED BY THE IMMENSE NEED TO WIN IFCHANCE WOULD BE KIND ENOUGH TO LET HIM
 AN INCIDENT WHICH HAPPENED NOTVERY LONG AFTER THAT AIRY NOTION OF GETTING AID FROM HIS UNCLE HAD BEENEXCLUDED WAS A STRONG SIGN OF THE EFFECT THAT MIGHT HAVE FOLLOWED ANYEXTANT OPPORTUNITY OF GAMBLING
THE BILLIARDROOM AT THE GREEN DRAGON WAS THE CONSTANT RESORT OF ACERTAIN SET MOST OF WHOM LIKE OUR ACQUAINTANCE MR
 BAMBRIDGE WEREREGARDED AS MEN OF PLEASURE
 IT WAS HERE THAT POOR FRED VINCY HAD MADEPART OF HIS MEMORABLE DEBT HAVING LOST MONEY IN BETTING AND BEENOBLIGED TO BORROW OF THAT GAY COMPANION
 IT WAS GENERALLY KNOWN INMIDDLEMARCH THAT A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY WAS LOST AND WON IN THIS WAY ANDTHE CONSEQUENT REPUTE OF THE GREEN DRAGON AS A PLACE OF DISSIPATIONNATURALLY HEIGHTENED IN SOME QUARTERS THE TEMPTATION TO GO THERE
PROBABLY ITS REGULAR VISITANTS LIKE THE INITIATES OF FREEMASONRYWISHED THAT THERE WERE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE TREMENDOUS TO KEEP TOTHEMSELVES CONCERNING IT BUT THEY WERE NOT A CLOSED COMMUNITY ANDMANY DECENT SENIORS AS WELL AS JUNIORS OCCASIONALLY TURNED INTO THEBILLIARDROOM TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON
 LYDGATE WHO HAD THE MUSCULARAPTITUDE FOR BILLIARDS AND WAS FOND OF THE GAME HAD ONCE OR TWICE INTHE EARLY DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN MIDDLEMARCH TAKEN HIS TURN WITH THECUE AT THE GREEN DRAGON BUT AFTERWARDS HE HAD NO LEISURE FOR THE GAMEAND NO INCLINATION FOR THE SOCIALITIES THERE
 ONE EVENING HOWEVER HEHAD OCCASION TO SEEK MR
 BAMBRIDGE AT THAT RESORT
 THE HORSEDEALER HADENGAGED TO GET HIM A CUSTOMER FOR HIS REMAINING GOOD HORSE FOR WHICHLYDGATE HAD DETERMINED TO SUBSTITUTE A CHEAP HACK HOPING BY THISREDUCTION OF STYLE TO GET PERHAPS TWENTY POUNDS AND HE CARED NOW FOREVERY SMALL SUM AS A HELP TOWARDS FEEDING THE PATIENCE OF HISTRADESMEN
 TO RUN UP TO THE BILLIARDROOM AS HE WAS PASSING WOULDSAVE TIME
MR
 BAMBRIDGE WAS NOT YET COME BUT WOULD BE SURE TO ARRIVE BYANDBYSAID HIS FRIEND MR
 HORROCK AND LYDGATE STAYED PLAYING A GAME FOR THESAKE OF PASSING THE TIME
 THAT EVENING HE HAD THE PECULIAR LIGHT IN THEEYES AND THE UNUSUAL VIVACITY WHICH HAD BEEN ONCE NOTICED IN HIM BY MR
FAREBROTHER
 THE EXCEPTIONAL FACT OF HIS PRESENCE WAS MUCH NOTICED INTHE ROOM WHERE THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF MIDDLEMARCH COMPANY ANDSEVERAL LOOKERSON AS WELL AS SOME OF THE PLAYERS WERE BETTING WITHANIMATION
 LYDGATE WAS PLAYING WELL AND FELT CONFIDENT THE BETS WEREDROPPING ROUND HIM AND WITH A SWIFT GLANCING THOUGHT OF THE PROBABLEGAIN WHICH MIGHT DOUBLE THE SUM HE WAS SAVING FROM HIS HORSE HE BEGANTO BET ON HIS OWN PLAY AND WON AGAIN AND AGAIN
 MR
 BAMBRIDGE HAD COMEIN BUT LYDGATE DID NOT NOTICE HIM
 HE WAS NOT ONLY EXCITED WITH HISPLAY BUT VISIONS WERE GLEAMING ON HIM OF GOING THE NEXT DAY TOBRASSING WHERE THERE WAS GAMBLING ON A GRANDER SCALE TO BE HAD ANDWHERE BY ONE POWERFUL SNATCH AT THE DEVILS BAIT HE MIGHT CARRY ITOFF WITHOUT THE HOOK AND BUY HIS RESCUE FROM HIS DAILY SOLICITINGS
HE WAS STILL WINNING WHEN TWO NEW VISITORS ENTERED
 ONE OF THEM WAS AYOUNG HAWLEY JUST COME FROM HIS LAW STUDIES IN TOWN AND THE OTHER WASFRED VINCY WHO HAD SPENT SEVERAL EVENINGS OF LATE AT THIS OLD HAUNT OFHIS
 YOUNG HAWLEY AN ACCOMPLISHED BILLIARDPLAYER BROUGHT A COOLFRESH HAND TO THE CUE
 BUT FRED VINCY STARTLED AT SEEING LYDGATE ANDASTONISHED TO SEE HIM BETTING WITH AN EXCITED AIR STOOD ASIDE ANDKEPT OUT OF THE CIRCLE ROUND THE TABLE
FRED HAD BEEN REWARDING RESOLUTION BY A LITTLE LAXITY OF LATE
 HE HADBEEN WORKING HEARTILY FOR SIX MONTHS AT ALL OUTDOOR OCCUPATIONS UNDERMR
 GARTH AND BY DINT OF SEVERE PRACTICE HAD NEARLY MASTERED THEDEFECTS OF HIS HANDWRITING THIS PRACTICE BEING PERHAPS A LITTLE THELESS SEVERE THAT IT WAS OFTEN CARRIED ON IN THE EVENING AT MR
 GARTHSUNDER THE EYES OF MARY
 BUT THE LAST FORTNIGHT MARY HAD BEEN STAYING ATLOWICK PARSONAGE WITH THE LADIES THERE DURING MR
 FAREBROTHERSRESIDENCE IN MIDDLEMARCH WHERE HE WAS CARRYING OUT SOME PAROCHIALPLANS AND FRED NOT SEEING ANYTHING MORE AGREEABLE TO DO HAD TURNEDINTO THE GREEN DRAGON PARTLY TO PLAY AT BILLIARDS PARTLY TO TASTE THEOLD FLAVOR OF DISCOURSE ABOUT HORSES SPORT AND THINGS IN GENERALCONSIDERED FROM A POINT OF VIEW WHICH WAS NOT STRENUOUSLY CORRECT
 HEHAD NOT BEEN OUT HUNTING ONCE THIS SEASON HAD HAD NO HORSE OF HIS OWNTO RIDE AND HAD GONE FROM PLACE TO PLACE CHIEFLY WITH MR
 GARTH IN HISGIG OR ON THE SOBER COB WHICH MR
 GARTH COULD LEND HIM
 IT WAS ALITTLE TOO BAD FRED BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE SHOULD BE KEPT IN THETRACES WITH MORE SEVERITY THAN IF HE HAD BEEN A CLERGYMAN
 I WILL TELLYOU WHAT MISTRESS MARYIT WILL BE RATHER HARDER WORK TO LEARNSURVEYING AND DRAWING PLANS THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO WRITE SERMONSHE HAD SAID WISHING HER TO APPRECIATE WHAT HE WENT THROUGH FOR HERSAKE AND AS TO HERCULES AND THESEUS THEY WERE NOTHING TO ME
 THEYHAD SPORT AND NEVER LEARNED TO WRITE A BOOKKEEPING HAND
 AND NOWMARY BEING OUT OF THE WAY FOR A LITTLE WHILE FRED LIKE ANY OTHERSTRONG DOG WHO CANNOT SLIP HIS COLLAR HAD PULLED UP THE STAPLE OF HISCHAIN AND MADE A SMALL ESCAPE NOT OF COURSE MEANING TO GO FAST OR FAR
THERE COULD BE NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD NOT PLAY AT BILLIARDS BUT HEWAS DETERMINED NOT TO BET
 AS TO MONEY JUST NOW FRED HAD IN HIS MINDTHE HEROIC PROJECT OF SAVING ALMOST ALL OF THE EIGHTY POUNDS THAT MR
GARTH OFFERED HIM AND RETURNING IT WHICH HE COULD EASILY DO BY GIVINGUP ALL FUTILE MONEYSPENDING SINCE HE HAD A SUPERFLUOUS STOCK OFCLOTHES AND NO EXPENSE IN HIS BOARD
 IN THAT WAY HE COULD IN ONEYEAR GO A GOOD WAY TOWARDS REPAYING THE NINETY POUNDS OF WHICH HE HADDEPRIVED MRS
 GARTH UNHAPPILY AT A TIME WHEN SHE NEEDED THAT SUM MORETHAN SHE DID NOW
 NEVERTHELESS IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ON THISEVENING WHICH WAS THE FIFTH OF HIS RECENT VISITS TO THE BILLIARDROOMFRED HAD NOT IN HIS POCKET BUT IN HIS MIND THE TEN POUNDS WHICH HEMEANT TO RESERVE FOR HIMSELF FROM HIS HALFYEARS SALARY HAVING BEFOREHIM THE PLEASURE OF CARRYING THIRTY TO MRS
 GARTH WHEN MARY WAS LIKELYTO BE COME HOME AGAINHE HAD THOSE TEN POUNDS IN HIS MIND AS A FUNDFROM WHICH HE MIGHT RISK SOMETHING IF THERE WERE A CHANCE OF A GOODBET
 WHY
 WELL WHEN SOVEREIGNS WERE FLYING ABOUT WHY SHOULDNT HECATCH A FEW
 HE WOULD NEVER GO FAR ALONG THAT ROAD AGAIN BUT A MANLIKES TO ASSURE HIMSELF AND MEN OF PLEASURE GENERALLY WHAT HE COULDDO IN THE WAY OF MISCHIEF IF HE CHOSE AND THAT IF HE ABSTAINS FROMMAKING HIMSELF ILL OR BEGGARING HIMSELF OR TALKING WITH THE UTMOSTLOOSENESS WHICH THE NARROW LIMITS OF HUMAN CAPACITY WILL ALLOW IT ISNOT BECAUSE HE IS A SPOONEY
 FRED DID NOT ENTER INTO FORMAL REASONSWHICH ARE A VERY ARTIFICIAL INEXACT WAY OF REPRESENTING THE TINGLINGRETURNS OF OLD HABIT AND THE CAPRICES OF YOUNG BLOOD BUT THERE WASLURKING IN HIM A PROPHETIC SENSE THAT EVENING THAT WHEN HE BEGAN TOPLAY HE SHOULD ALSO BEGIN TO BETTHAT HE SHOULD ENJOY SOMEPUNCHDRINKING AND IN GENERAL PREPARE HIMSELF FOR FEELING RATHERSEEDY IN THE MORNING
 IT IS IN SUCH INDEFINABLE MOVEMENTS THAT ACTIONOFTEN BEGINS
BUT THE LAST THING LIKELY TO HAVE ENTERED FREDS EXPECTATION WAS THATHE SHOULD SEE HIS BROTHERINLAW LYDGATEOF WHOM HE HAD NEVER QUITEDROPPED THE OLD OPINION THAT HE WAS A PRIG AND TREMENDOUSLY CONSCIOUSOF HIS SUPERIORITYLOOKING EXCITED AND BETTING JUST AS HE HIMSELFMIGHT HAVE DONE
 FRED FELT A SHOCK GREATER THAN HE COULD QUITE ACCOUNTFOR BY THE VAGUE KNOWLEDGE THAT LYDGATE WAS IN DEBT AND THAT HISFATHER HAD REFUSED TO HELP HIM AND HIS OWN INCLINATION TO ENTER INTOTHE PLAY WAS SUDDENLY CHECKED
 IT WAS A STRANGE REVERSAL OF ATTITUDESFREDS BLOND FACE AND BLUE EYES USUALLY BRIGHT AND CARELESS READY TOGIVE ATTENTION TO ANYTHING THAT HELD OUT A PROMISE OF AMUSEMENTLOOKING INVOLUNTARILY GRAVE AND ALMOST EMBARRASSED AS IF BY THE SIGHTOF SOMETHING UNFITTING WHILE LYDGATE WHO HAD HABITUALLY AN AIR OFSELFPOSSESSED STRENGTH AND A CERTAIN MEDITATIVENESS THAT SEEMED TOLIE BEHIND HIS MOST OBSERVANT ATTENTION WAS ACTING WATCHING SPEAKINGWITH THAT EXCITED NARROW CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH REMINDS ONE OF AN ANIMALWITH FIERCE EYES AND RETRACTILE CLAWS
LYDGATE BY BETTING ON HIS OWN STROKES HAD WON SIXTEEN POUNDS BUTYOUNG HAWLEYS ARRIVAL HAD CHANGED THE POISE OF THINGS
 HE MADEFIRSTRATE STROKES HIMSELF AND BEGAN TO BET AGAINST LYDGATES STROKESTHE STRAIN OF WHOSE NERVES WAS THUS CHANGED FROM SIMPLE CONFIDENCE INHIS OWN MOVEMENTS TO DEFYING ANOTHER PERSONS DOUBT IN THEM
 THEDEFIANCE WAS MORE EXCITING THAN THE CONFIDENCE BUT IT WAS LESS SURE
HE CONTINUED TO BET ON HIS OWN PLAY BUT BEGAN OFTEN TO FAIL
 STILL HEWENT ON FOR HIS MIND WAS AS UTTERLY NARROWED INTO THAT PRECIPITOUSCREVICE OF PLAY AS IF HE HAD BEEN THE MOST IGNORANT LOUNGER THERE
 FREDOBSERVED THAT LYDGATE WAS LOSING FAST AND FOUND HIMSELF IN THE NEWSITUATION OF PUZZLING HIS BRAINS TO THINK OF SOME DEVICE BY WHICHWITHOUT BEING OFFENSIVE HE COULD WITHDRAW LYDGATES ATTENTION ANDPERHAPS SUGGEST TO HIM A REASON FOR QUITTING THE ROOM
 HE SAW THATOTHERS WERE OBSERVING LYDGATES STRANGE UNLIKENESS TO HIMSELF AND ITOCCURRED TO HIM THAT MERELY TO TOUCH HIS ELBOW AND CALL HIM ASIDE FOR AMOMENT MIGHT ROUSE HIM FROM HIS ABSORPTION
 HE COULD THINK OF NOTHINGCLEVERER THAN THE DARING IMPROBABILITY OF SAYING THAT HE WANTED TO SEEROSY AND WISHED TO KNOW IF SHE WERE AT HOME THIS EVENING AND HE WASGOING DESPERATELY TO CARRY OUT THIS WEAK DEVICE WHEN A WAITER CAME UPTO HIM WITH A MESSAGE SAYING THAT MR
 FAREBROTHER WAS BELOW ANDBEGGED TO SPEAK WITH HIM
FRED WAS SURPRISED NOT QUITE COMFORTABLY BUT SENDING WORD THAT HEWOULD BE DOWN IMMEDIATELY HE WENT WITH A NEW IMPULSE UP TO LYDGATESAID CAN I SPEAK TO YOU A MOMENT
 AND DREW HIM ASIDE
FAREBROTHER HAS JUST SENT UP A MESSAGE TO SAY THAT HE WANTS TO SPEAKTO ME
 HE IS BELOW
 I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO KNOW HE WAS THERE IFYOU HAD ANYTHING TO SAY TO HIM
FRED HAD SIMPLY SNATCHED UP THIS PRETEXT FOR SPEAKING BECAUSE HE COULDNOT SAY YOU ARE LOSING CONFOUNDEDLY AND ARE MAKING EVERYBODY STAREAT YOU YOU HAD BETTER COME AWAY
 BUT INSPIRATION COULD HARDLY HAVESERVED HIM BETTER
 LYDGATE HAD NOT BEFORE SEEN THAT FRED WAS PRESENTAND HIS SUDDEN APPEARANCE WITH AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF MR
 FAREBROTHER HADTHE EFFECT OF A SHARP CONCUSSION
NO NO SAID LYDGATE I HAVE NOTHING PARTICULAR TO SAY TO HIM
BUTTHE GAME IS UPI MUST BE GOINGI CAME IN JUST TO SEE BAMBRIDGE
BAMBRIDGE IS OVER THERE BUT HE IS MAKING A ROWI DONT THINK HESREADY FOR BUSINESS
 COME DOWN WITH ME TO FAREBROTHER
 I EXPECT HE ISGOING TO BLOW ME UP AND YOU WILL SHIELD ME SAID FRED WITH SOMEADROITNESS
LYDGATE FELT SHAME BUT COULD NOT BEAR TO ACT AS IF HE FELT IT BYREFUSING TO SEE MR
 FAREBROTHER AND HE WENT DOWN
 THEY MERELY SHOOKHANDS HOWEVER AND SPOKE OF THE FROST AND WHEN ALL THREE HAD TURNEDINTO THE STREET THE VICAR SEEMED QUITE WILLING TO SAY GOODBY TOLYDGATE
 HIS PRESENT PURPOSE WAS CLEARLY TO TALK WITH FRED ALONE ANDHE SAID KINDLY I DISTURBED YOU YOUNG GENTLEMAN BECAUSE I HAVE SOMEPRESSING BUSINESS WITH YOU
 WALK WITH ME TO ST
 BOTOLPHS WILL YOU
IT WAS A FINE NIGHT THE SKY THICK WITH STARS AND MR
 FAREBROTHERPROPOSED THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE A CIRCUIT TO THE OLD CHURCH BY THELONDON ROAD
 THE NEXT THING HE SAID WASI THOUGHT LYDGATE NEVER WENT TO THE GREEN DRAGON
SO DID I SAID FRED
 BUT HE SAID THAT HE WENT TO SEE BAMBRIDGE
HE WAS NOT PLAYING THEN
FRED HAD NOT MEANT TO TELL THIS BUT HE WAS OBLIGED NOW TO SAY YESHE WAS
 BUT I SUPPOSE IT WAS AN ACCIDENTAL THING
 I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIMTHERE BEFORE
YOU HAVE BEEN GOING OFTEN YOURSELF THEN LATELY
OH ABOUT FIVE OR SIX TIMES
I THINK YOU HAD SOME GOOD REASON FOR GIVING UP THE HABIT OF GOINGTHERE
YES
 YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT SAID FRED NOT LIKING TO BE CATECHISED INTHIS WAY
 I MADE A CLEAN BREAST TO YOU
I SUPPOSE THAT GIVES ME A WARRANT TO SPEAK ABOUT THE MATTER NOW
 IT ISUNDERSTOOD BETWEEN US IS IT NOT
THAT WE ARE ON A FOOTING OF OPENFRIENDSHIP I HAVE LISTENED TO YOU AND YOU WILL BE WILLING TO LISTENTO ME
 I MAY TAKE MY TURN IN TALKING A LITTLE ABOUT MYSELF
I AM UNDER THE DEEPEST OBLIGATION TO YOU MR
 FAREBROTHER SAID FREDIN A STATE OF UNCOMFORTABLE SURMISE
I WILL NOT AFFECT TO DENY THAT YOU ARE UNDER SOME OBLIGATION TO ME
BUT I AM GOING TO CONFESS TO YOU FRED THAT I HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TOREVERSE ALL THAT BY KEEPING SILENCE WITH YOU JUST NOW
 WHEN SOMEBODYSAID TO ME YOUNG VINCY HAS TAKEN TO BEING AT THE BILLIARDTABLE EVERYNIGHT AGAINHE WONT BEAR THE CURB LONG I WAS TEMPTED TO DO THEOPPOSITE OF WHAT I AM DOINGTO HOLD MY TONGUE AND WAIT WHILE YOU WENTDOWN THE LADDER AGAIN BETTING FIRST AND THENI HAVE NOT MADE ANY BETS SAID FRED HASTILY
GLAD TO HEAR IT
 BUT I SAY MY PROMPTING WAS TO LOOK ON AND SEE YOUTAKE THE WRONG TURNING WEAR OUT GARTHS PATIENCE AND LOSE THE BESTOPPORTUNITY OF YOUR LIFETHE OPPORTUNITY WHICH YOU MADE SOME RATHERDIFFICULT EFFORT TO SECURE
 YOU CAN GUESS THE FEELING WHICH RAISED THATTEMPTATION IN MEI AM SURE YOU KNOW IT
 I AM SURE YOU KNOW THAT THESATISFACTION OF YOUR AFFECTIONS STANDS IN THE WAY OF MINE
THERE WAS A PAUSE
 MR
 FAREBROTHER SEEMED TO WAIT FOR A RECOGNITION OFTHE FACT AND THE EMOTION PERCEPTIBLE IN THE TONES OF HIS FINE VOICEGAVE SOLEMNITY TO HIS WORDS
 BUT NO FEELING COULD QUELL FREDS ALARM
I COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO GIVE HER UP HE SAID AFTER A MOMENTSHESITATION IT WAS NOT A CASE FOR ANY PRETENCE OF GENEROSITY
CLEARLY NOT WHEN HER AFFECTION MET YOURS
 BUT RELATIONS OF THIS SORTEVEN WHEN THEY ARE OF LONG STANDING ARE ALWAYS LIABLE TO CHANGE
 I CANEASILY CONCEIVE THAT YOU MIGHT ACT IN A WAY TO LOOSEN THE TIE SHE FEELSTOWARDS YOUIT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT SHE IS ONLY CONDITIONALLY BOUNDTO YOUAND THAT IN THAT CASE ANOTHER MAN WHO MAY FLATTER HIMSELF THATHE HAS A HOLD ON HER REGARD MIGHT SUCCEED IN WINNING THAT FIRM PLACEIN HER LOVE AS WELL AS RESPECT WHICH YOU HAD LET SLIP
 I CAN EASILYCONCEIVE SUCH A RESULT REPEATED MR
 FAREBROTHER EMPHATICALLY
 THEREIS A COMPANIONSHIP OF READY SYMPATHY WHICH MIGHT GET THE ADVANTAGEEVEN OVER THE LONGEST ASSOCIATIONS
 IT SEEMED TO FRED THAT IF MR
FAREBROTHER HAD HAD A BEAK AND TALONS INSTEAD OF HIS VERY CAPABLETONGUE HIS MODE OF ATTACK COULD HARDLY BE MORE CRUEL
 HE HAD AHORRIBLE CONVICTION THAT BEHIND ALL THIS HYPOTHETIC STATEMENT THERE WASA KNOWLEDGE OF SOME ACTUAL CHANGE IN MARYS FEELING
OF COURSE I KNOW IT MIGHT EASILY BE ALL UP WITH ME HE SAID IN ATROUBLED VOICE
 IF SHE IS BEGINNING TO COMPARE HE BROKE OFF NOTLIKING TO BETRAY ALL HE FELT AND THEN SAID BY THE HELP OF A LITTLEBITTERNESS BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE FRIENDLY TO ME
SO I AM THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE
 BUT I HAVE HAD A STRONG DISPOSITIONTO BE OTHERWISE
 I HAVE SAID TO MYSELF IF THERE IS A LIKELIHOOD OFTHAT YOUNGSTER DOING HIMSELF HARM WHY SHOULD YOU INTERFERE
 ARENT YOUWORTH AS MUCH AS HE IS AND DONT YOUR SIXTEEN YEARS OVER AND ABOVEHIS IN WHICH YOU HAVE GONE RATHER HUNGRY GIVE YOU MORE RIGHT TOSATISFACTION THAN HE HAS
 IF THERES A CHANCE OF HIS GOING TO THE DOGSLET HIMPERHAPS YOU COULD NOHOW HINDER ITAND DO YOU TAKE THEBENEFIT
THERE WAS A PAUSE IN WHICH FRED WAS SEIZED BY A MOST UNCOMFORTABLECHILL
 WHAT WAS COMING NEXT
 HE DREADED TO HEAR THAT SOMETHING HAD BEENSAID TO MARYHE FELT AS IF HE WERE LISTENING TO A THREAT RATHER THAN AWARNING
 WHEN THE VICAR BEGAN AGAIN THERE WAS A CHANGE IN HIS TONE LIKETHE ENCOURAGING TRANSITION TO A MAJOR KEY
BUT I HAD ONCE MEANT BETTER THAN THAT AND I AM COME BACK TO MY OLDINTENTION
 I THOUGHT THAT I COULD HARDLY SECURE MYSELF IN IT BETTERFRED THAN BY TELLING YOU JUST WHAT HAD GONE ON IN ME
 AND NOW DO YOUUNDERSTAND ME
 I WANT YOU TO MAKE THE HAPPINESS OF HER LIFE AND YOUROWN AND IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE THAT A WORD OF WARNING FROM ME MAY TURNASIDE ANY RISK TO THE CONTRARYWELL I HAVE UTTERED IT
THERE WAS A DROP IN THE VICARS VOICE WHEN HE SPOKE THE LAST WORDS
 HEPAUSEDTHEY WERE STANDING ON A PATCH OF GREEN WHERE THE ROAD DIVERGEDTOWARDS ST
 BOTOLPHS AND HE PUT OUT HIS HAND AS IF TO IMPLY THAT THECONVERSATION WAS CLOSED
 FRED WAS MOVED QUITE NEWLY
 SOME ONE HIGHLYSUSCEPTIBLE TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF A FINE ACT HAS SAID THAT ITPRODUCES A SORT OF REGENERATING SHUDDER THROUGH THE FRAME AND MAKESONE FEEL READY TO BEGIN A NEW LIFE
 A GOOD DEGREE OF THAT EFFECT WASJUST THEN PRESENT IN FRED VINCY
I WILL TRY TO BE WORTHY HE SAID BREAKING OFF BEFORE HE COULD SAYOF YOU AS WELL AS OF HER
 AND MEANWHILE MR
 FAREBROTHER HAD GATHEREDTHE IMPULSE TO SAY SOMETHING MORE
YOU MUST NOT IMAGINE THAT I BELIEVE THERE IS AT PRESENT ANY DECLINE INHER PREFERENCE OF YOU FRED
 SET YOUR HEART AT REST THAT IF YOU KEEPRIGHT OTHER THINGS WILL KEEP RIGHT
I SHALL NEVER FORGET WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FRED ANSWERED
 I CANT SAYANYTHING THAT SEEMS WORTH SAYINGONLY I WILL TRY THAT YOUR GOODNESSSHALL NOT BE THROWN AWAY
THATS ENOUGH
 GOODBY AND GOD BLESS YOU
IN THAT WAY THEY PARTED
 BUT BOTH OF THEM WALKED ABOUT A LONG WHILEBEFORE THEY WENT OUT OF THE STARLIGHT
 MUCH OF FREDS RUMINATION MIGHTBE SUMMED UP IN THE WORDS IT CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A FINE THINGFOR HER TO MARRY FAREBROTHERBUT IF SHE LOVES ME BEST AND I AM A GOODHUSBAND
PERHAPS MR
 FAREBROTHERS MIGHT BE CONCENTRATED INTO A SINGLE SHRUG ANDONE LITTLE SPEECH
 TO THINK OF THE PART ONE LITTLE WOMAN CAN PLAY INTHE LIFE OF A MAN SO THAT TO RENOUNCE HER MAY BE A VERY GOOD IMITATIONOF HEROISM AND TO WIN HER MAY BE A DISCIPLINE
CHAPTER LXVII
NOW IS THERE CIVIL WAR WITHIN THE SOULRESOLVE IS THRUST FROM OFF THE SACRED THRONEBY CLAMOROUS NEEDS AND PRIDE THE GRANDVIZIERMAKES HUMBLE COMPACT PLAYS THE SUPPLE PARTOF ENVOY AND DEFTTONGUED APOLOGISTFOR HUNGRY REBELS
HAPPILY LYDGATE HAD ENDED BY LOSING IN THE BILLIARDROOM AND BROUGHTAWAY NO ENCOURAGEMENT TO MAKE A RAID ON LUCK
 ON THE CONTRARY HE FELTUNMIXED DISGUST WITH HIMSELF THE NEXT DAY WHEN HE HAD TO PAY FOUR ORFIVE POUNDS OVER AND ABOVE HIS GAINS AND HE CARRIED ABOUT WITH HIM AMOST UNPLEASANT VISION OF THE FIGURE HE HAD MADE NOT ONLY RUBBINGELBOWS WITH THE MEN AT THE GREEN DRAGON BUT BEHAVING JUST AS THEY DID
A PHILOSOPHER FALLEN TO BETTING IS HARDLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM APHILISTINE UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES THE DIFFERENCE WILL CHIEFLY BEFOUND IN HIS SUBSEQUENT REFLECTIONS AND LYDGATE CHEWED A VERYDISAGREEABLE CUD IN THAT WAY
 HIS REASON TOLD HIM HOW THE AFFAIR MIGHTHAVE BEEN MAGNIFIED INTO RUIN BY A SLIGHT CHANGE OF SCENERYIF IT HADBEEN A GAMBLINGHOUSE THAT HE HAD TURNED INTO WHERE CHANCE COULD BECLUTCHED WITH BOTH HANDS INSTEAD OF BEING PICKED UP WITH THUMB ANDFOREFINGER
 NEVERTHELESS THOUGH REASON STRANGLED THE DESIRE TOGAMBLE THERE REMAINED THE FEELING THAT WITH AN ASSURANCE OF LUCK TOTHE NEEDFUL AMOUNT HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GAMBLE RATHER THAN TAKE THEALTERNATIVE WHICH WAS BEGINNING TO URGE ITSELF AS INEVITABLE
THAT ALTERNATIVE WAS TO APPLY TO MR
 BULSTRODE
 LYDGATE HAD SO MANYTIMES BOASTED BOTH TO HIMSELF AND OTHERS THAT HE WAS TOTALLYINDEPENDENT OF BULSTRODE TO WHOSE PLANS HE HAD LENT HIMSELF SOLELYBECAUSE THEY ENABLED HIM TO CARRY OUT HIS OWN IDEAS OF PROFESSIONALWORK AND PUBLIC BENEFITHE HAD SO CONSTANTLY IN THEIR PERSONALINTERCOURSE HAD HIS PRIDE SUSTAINED BY THE SENSE THAT HE WAS MAKING AGOOD SOCIAL USE OF THIS PREDOMINATING BANKER WHOSE OPINIONS HE THOUGHTCONTEMPTIBLE AND WHOSE MOTIVES OFTEN SEEMED TO HIM AN ABSURD MIXTURE OFCONTRADICTORY IMPRESSIONSTHAT HE HAD BEEN CREATING FOR HIMSELF STRONGIDEAL OBSTACLES TO THE PROFFERING OF ANY CONSIDERABLE REQUEST TO HIM ONHIS OWN ACCOUNT
STILL EARLY IN MARCH HIS AFFAIRS WERE AT THAT PASS IN WHICH MEN BEGINTO SAY THAT THEIR OATHS WERE DELIVERED IN IGNORANCE AND TO PERCEIVETHAT THE ACT WHICH THEY HAD CALLED IMPOSSIBLE TO THEM IS BECOMINGMANIFESTLY POSSIBLE
 WITH DOVERS UGLY SECURITY SOON TO BE PUT INFORCE WITH THE PROCEEDS OF HIS PRACTICE IMMEDIATELY ABSORBED IN PAYINGBACK DEBTS AND WITH THE CHANCE IF THE WORST WERE KNOWN OF DAILYSUPPLIES BEING REFUSED ON CREDIT ABOVE ALL WITH THE VISION OFROSAMONDS HOPELESS DISCONTENT CONTINUALLY HAUNTING HIM LYDGATE HADBEGUN TO SEE THAT HE SHOULD INEVITABLY BEND HIMSELF TO ASK HELP FROMSOMEBODY OR OTHER
 AT FIRST HE HAD CONSIDERED WHETHER HE SHOULD WRITETO MR
 VINCY BUT ON QUESTIONING ROSAMOND HE FOUND THAT AS HE HADSUSPECTED SHE HAD ALREADY APPLIED TWICE TO HER FATHER THE LAST TIMEBEING SINCE THE DISAPPOINTMENT FROM SIR GODWIN AND PAPA HAD SAID THATLYDGATE MUST LOOK OUT FOR HIMSELF
 PAPA SAID HE HAD COME WITH ONE BADYEAR AFTER ANOTHER TO TRADE MORE AND MORE ON BORROWED CAPITAL AND HADHAD TO GIVE UP MANY INDULGENCES HE COULD NOT SPARE A SINGLE HUNDREDFROM THE CHARGES OF HIS FAMILY
 HE SAID LET LYDGATE ASK BULSTRODETHEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HAND AND GLOVE
INDEED LYDGATE HIMSELF HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IF HE MUST ENDBY ASKING FOR A FREE LOAN HIS RELATIONS WITH BULSTRODE MORE AT LEASTTHAN WITH ANY OTHER MAN MIGHT TAKE THE SHAPE OF A CLAIM WHICH WAS NOTPURELY PERSONAL
 BULSTRODE HAD INDIRECTLY HELPED TO CAUSE THE FAILUREOF HIS PRACTICE AND HAD ALSO BEEN HIGHLY GRATIFIED BY GETTING AMEDICAL PARTNER IN HIS PLANSBUT WHO AMONG US EVER REDUCED HIMSELF TOTHE SORT OF DEPENDENCE IN WHICH LYDGATE NOW STOOD WITHOUT TRYING TOBELIEVE THAT HE HAD CLAIMS WHICH DIMINISHED THE HUMILIATION OF ASKING
IT WAS TRUE THAT OF LATE THERE HAD SEEMED TO BE A NEW LANGUOR OFINTEREST IN BULSTRODE ABOUT THE HOSPITAL BUT HIS HEALTH HAD GOT WORSEAND SHOWED SIGNS OF A DEEPSEATED NERVOUS AFFECTION
 IN OTHER RESPECTSHE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE CHANGED HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN HIGHLY POLITE BUTLYDGATE HAD OBSERVED IN HIM FROM THE FIRST A MARKED COLDNESS ABOUT HISMARRIAGE AND OTHER PRIVATE CIRCUMSTANCES A COLDNESS WHICH HE HADHITHERTO PREFERRED TO ANY WARMTH OF FAMILIARITY BETWEEN THEM
 HEDEFERRED THE INTENTION FROM DAY TO DAY HIS HABIT OF ACTING ON HISCONCLUSIONS BEING MADE INFIRM BY HIS REPUGNANCE TO EVERY POSSIBLECONCLUSION AND ITS CONSEQUENT ACT
 HE SAW MR
 BULSTRODE OFTEN BUT HEDID NOT TRY TO USE ANY OCCASION FOR HIS PRIVATE PURPOSE
 AT ONE MOMENTHE THOUGHT I WILL WRITE A LETTER I PREFER THAT TO ANY CIRCUITOUSTALK AT ANOTHER HE THOUGHT NO IF I WERE TALKING TO HIM I COULDMAKE A RETREAT BEFORE ANY SIGNS OF DISINCLINATION
STILL THE DAYS PASSED AND NO LETTER WAS WRITTEN NO SPECIAL INTERVIEWSOUGHT
 IN HIS SHRINKING FROM THE HUMILIATION OF A DEPENDENT ATTITUDETOWARDS BULSTRODE HE BEGAN TO FAMILIARIZE HIS IMAGINATION WITH ANOTHERSTEP EVEN MORE UNLIKE HIS REMEMBERED SELF
 HE BEGAN SPONTANEOUSLY TOCONSIDER WHETHER IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT THAT PUERILE NOTIONOF ROSAMONDS WHICH HAD OFTEN MADE HIM ANGRY NAMELY THAT THEY SHOULDQUIT MIDDLEMARCH WITHOUT SEEING ANYTHING BEYOND THAT PREFACE
 THEQUESTION CAMEWOULD ANY MAN BUY THE PRACTICE OF ME EVEN NOW FOR ASLITTLE AS IT IS WORTH
 THEN THE SALE MIGHT HAPPEN AS A NECESSARYPREPARATION FOR GOING AWAY
BUT AGAINST HIS TAKING THIS STEP WHICH HE STILL FELT TO BE ACONTEMPTIBLE RELINQUISHMENT OF PRESENT WORK A GUILTY TURNING ASIDEFROM WHAT WAS A REAL AND MIGHT BE A WIDENING CHANNEL FOR WORTHYACTIVITY TO START AGAIN WITHOUT ANY JUSTIFIED DESTINATION THERE WASTHIS OBSTACLE THAT THE PURCHASER IF PROCURABLE AT ALL MIGHT NOT BEQUICKLY FORTHCOMING
 AND AFTERWARDS
 ROSAMOND IN A POOR LODGING THOUGHIN THE LARGEST CITY OR MOST DISTANT TOWN WOULD NOT FIND THE LIFE THATCOULD SAVE HER FROM GLOOM AND SAVE HIM FROM THE REPROACH OF HAVINGPLUNGED HER INTO IT
 FOR WHEN A MAN IS AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL IN HISFORTUNES HE MAY STAY A LONG WHILE THERE IN SPITE OF PROFESSIONALACCOMPLISHMENT
 IN THE BRITISH CLIMATE THERE IS NO INCOMPATIBILITYBETWEEN SCIENTIFIC INSIGHT AND FURNISHED LODGINGS THE INCOMPATIBILITYIS CHIEFLY BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC AMBITION AND A WIFE WHO OBJECTS TO THATKIND OF RESIDENCE
BUT IN THE MIDST OF HIS HESITATION OPPORTUNITY CAME TO DECIDE HIM
 ANOTE FROM MR
 BULSTRODE REQUESTED LYDGATE TO CALL ON HIM AT THE BANK
 AHYPOCHONDRIACAL TENDENCY HAD SHOWN ITSELF IN THE BANKERS CONSTITUTIONOF LATE AND A LACK OF SLEEP WHICH WAS REALLY ONLY A SLIGHTEXAGGERATION OF AN HABITUAL DYSPEPTIC SYMPTOM HAD BEEN DWELT ON BY HIMAS A SIGN OF THREATENING INSANITY
 HE WANTED TO CONSULT LYDGATE WITHOUTDELAY ON THAT PARTICULAR MORNING ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOTHING TO TELLBEYOND WHAT HE HAD TOLD BEFORE
 HE LISTENED EAGERLY TO WHAT LYDGATE HADTO SAY IN DISSIPATION OF HIS FEARS THOUGH THIS TOO WAS ONLYREPETITION AND THIS MOMENT IN WHICH BULSTRODE WAS RECEIVING A MEDICALOPINION WITH A SENSE OF COMFORT SEEMED TO MAKE THE COMMUNICATION OF APERSONAL NEED TO HIM EASIER THAN IT HAD BEEN IN LYDGATES CONTEMPLATIONBEFOREHAND
 HE HAD BEEN INSISTING THAT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR MR
BULSTRODE TO RELAX HIS ATTENTION TO BUSINESS
ONE SEES HOW ANY MENTAL STRAIN HOWEVER SLIGHT MAY AFFECT A DELICATEFRAME SAID LYDGATE AT THAT STAGE OF THE CONSULTATION WHEN THE REMARKSTEND TO PASS FROM THE PERSONAL TO THE GENERAL BY THE DEEP STAMP WHICHANXIETY WILL MAKE FOR A TIME EVEN ON THE YOUNG AND VIGOROUS
 I AMNATURALLY VERY STRONG YET I HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY SHAKEN LATELY BY ANACCUMULATION OF TROUBLE
I PRESUME THAT A CONSTITUTION IN THE SUSCEPTIBLE STATE IN WHICH MINEAT PRESENT IS WOULD BE ESPECIALLY LIABLE TO FALL A VICTIM TO CHOLERAIF IT VISITED OUR DISTRICT
 AND SINCE ITS APPEARANCE NEAR LONDON WEMAY WELL BESIEGE THE MERCYSEAT FOR OUR PROTECTION SAID MR
BULSTRODE NOT INTENDING TO EVADE LYDGATES ALLUSION BUT REALLYPREOCCUPIED WITH ALARMS ABOUT HIMSELF
YOU HAVE AT ALL EVENTS TAKEN YOUR SHARE IN USING GOOD PRACTICALPRECAUTIONS FOR THE TOWN AND THAT IS THE BEST MODE OF ASKING FORPROTECTION SAID LYDGATE WITH A STRONG DISTASTE FOR THE BROKENMETAPHOR AND BAD LOGIC OF THE BANKERS RELIGION SOMEWHAT INCREASED BYTHE APPARENT DEAFNESS OF HIS SYMPATHY
 BUT HIS MIND HAD TAKEN UP ITSLONGPREPARED MOVEMENT TOWARDS GETTING HELP AND WAS NOT YET ARRESTED
HE ADDED THE TOWN HAS DONE WELL IN THE WAY OF CLEANSING AND FINDINGAPPLIANCES AND I THINK THAT IF THE CHOLERA SHOULD COME EVEN OURENEMIES WILL ADMIT THAT THE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE HOSPITAL ARE A PUBLICGOOD
TRULY SAID MR
 BULSTRODE WITH SOME COLDNESS
 WITH REGARD TO WHATYOU SAY MR
 LYDGATE ABOUT THE RELAXATION OF MY MENTAL LABOR I HAVEFOR SOME TIME BEEN ENTERTAINING A PURPOSE TO THAT EFFECTA PURPOSE OF AVERY DECIDED CHARACTER
 I CONTEMPLATE AT LEAST A TEMPORARY WITHDRAWALFROM THE MANAGEMENT OF MUCH BUSINESS WHETHER BENEVOLENT OR COMMERCIAL
ALSO I THINK OF CHANGING MY RESIDENCE FOR A TIME PROBABLY I SHALLCLOSE OR LET THE SHRUBS AND TAKE SOME PLACE NEAR THE COASTUNDERADVICE OF COURSE AS TO SALUBRITY
 THAT WOULD BE A MEASURE WHICH YOUWOULD RECOMMEND
OH YES SAID LYDGATE FALLING BACKWARD IN HIS CHAIR WITHILLREPRESSED IMPATIENCE UNDER THE BANKERS PALE EARNEST EYES ANDINTENSE PREOCCUPATION WITH HIMSELF
I HAVE FOR SOME TIME FELT THAT I SHOULD OPEN THIS SUBJECT WITH YOU INRELATION TO OUR HOSPITAL CONTINUED BULSTRODE
 UNDER THECIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE INDICATED OF COURSE I MUST CEASE TO HAVE ANYPERSONAL SHARE IN THE MANAGEMENT AND IT IS CONTRARY TO MY VIEWS OFRESPONSIBILITY TO CONTINUE A LARGE APPLICATION OF MEANS TO ANINSTITUTION WHICH I CANNOT WATCH OVER AND TO SOME EXTENT REGULATE
 ISHALL THEREFORE IN CASE OF MY ULTIMATE DECISION TO LEAVE MIDDLEMARCHCONSIDER THAT I WITHDRAW OTHER SUPPORT TO THE NEW HOSPITAL THAN THATWHICH WILL SUBSIST IN THE FACT THAT I CHIEFLY SUPPLIED THE EXPENSES OFBUILDING IT AND HAVE CONTRIBUTED FURTHER LARGE SUMS TO ITS SUCCESSFULWORKING
LYDGATES THOUGHT WHEN BULSTRODE PAUSED ACCORDING TO HIS WONT WASHE HAS PERHAPS BEEN LOSING A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY
 THIS WAS THE MOSTPLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION OF A SPEECH WHICH HAD CAUSED RATHER A STARTLINGCHANGE IN HIS EXPECTATIONS
 HE SAID IN REPLYTHE LOSS TO THE HOSPITAL CAN HARDLY BE MADE UP I FEAR
HARDLY RETURNED BULSTRODE IN THE SAME DELIBERATE SILVERY TONEEXCEPT BY SOME CHANGES OF PLAN
 THE ONLY PERSON WHO MAY BE CERTAINLYCOUNTED ON AS WILLING TO INCREASE HER CONTRIBUTIONS IS MRS
 CASAUBON
 IHAVE HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH HER ON THE SUBJECT AND I HAVE POINTED OUTTO HER AS I AM ABOUT TO DO TO YOU THAT IT WILL BE DESIRABLE TO WIN AMORE GENERAL SUPPORT TO THE NEW HOSPITAL BY A CHANGE OF SYSTEM
ANOTHER PAUSE BUT LYDGATE DID NOT SPEAK
THE CHANGE I MEAN IS AN AMALGAMATION WITH THE INFIRMARY SO THAT THENEW HOSPITAL SHALL BE REGARDED AS A SPECIAL ADDITION TO THE ELDERINSTITUTION HAVING THE SAME DIRECTING BOARD
 IT WILL BE NECESSARYALSO THAT THE MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF THE TWO SHALL BE COMBINED
 IN THISWAY ANY DIFFICULTY AS TO THE ADEQUATE MAINTENANCE OF OUR NEWESTABLISHMENT WILL BE REMOVED THE BENEVOLENT INTERESTS OF THE TOWNWILL CEASE TO BE DIVIDED
MR
 BULSTRODE HAD LOWERED HIS EYES FROM LYDGATES FACE TO THE BUTTONSOF HIS COAT AS HE AGAIN PAUSED
NO DOUBT THAT IS A GOOD DEVICE AS TO WAYS AND MEANS SAID LYDGATEWITH AN EDGE OF IRONY IN HIS TONE
 BUT I CANT BE EXPECTED TO REJOICEIN IT AT ONCE SINCE ONE OF THE FIRST RESULTS WILL BE THAT THE OTHERMEDICAL MEN WILL UPSET OR INTERRUPT MY METHODS IF IT WERE ONLY BECAUSETHEY ARE MINE
I MYSELF AS YOU KNOW MR
 LYDGATE HIGHLY VALUED THE OPPORTUNITY OFNEW AND INDEPENDENT PROCEDURE WHICH YOU HAVE DILIGENTLY EMPLOYED THEORIGINAL PLAN I CONFESS WAS ONE WHICH I HAD MUCH AT HEART UNDERSUBMISSION TO THE DIVINE WILL
 BUT SINCE PROVIDENTIAL INDICATIONSDEMAND A RENUNCIATION FROM ME I RENOUNCE
BULSTRODE SHOWED A RATHER EXASPERATING ABILITY IN THIS CONVERSATION
THE BROKEN METAPHOR AND BAD LOGIC OF MOTIVE WHICH HAD STIRRED HISHEARERS CONTEMPT WERE QUITE CONSISTENT WITH A MODE OF PUTTING THEFACTS WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR LYDGATE TO VENT HIS OWN INDIGNATIONAND DISAPPOINTMENT
 AFTER SOME RAPID REFLECTION HE ONLY ASKEDWHAT DID MRS
 CASAUBON SAY
THAT WAS THE FURTHER STATEMENT WHICH I WISHED TO MAKE TO YOU SAIDBULSTRODE WHO HAD THOROUGHLY PREPARED HIS MINISTERIAL EXPLANATION
SHE IS YOU ARE AWARE A WOMAN OF MOST MUNIFICENT DISPOSITION ANDHAPPILY IN POSSESSIONNOT I PRESUME OF GREAT WEALTH BUT OF FUNDS WHICHSHE CAN WELL SPARE
 SHE HAS INFORMED ME THAT THOUGH SHE HAS DESTINEDTHE CHIEF PART OF THOSE FUNDS TO ANOTHER PURPOSE SHE IS WILLING TOCONSIDER WHETHER SHE CANNOT FULLY TAKE MY PLACE IN RELATION TO THEHOSPITAL
 BUT SHE WISHES FOR AMPLE TIME TO MATURE HER THOUGHTS ON THESUBJECT AND I HAVE TOLD HER THAT THERE IS NO NEED FOR HASTETHAT INFACT MY OWN PLANS ARE NOT YET ABSOLUTE
LYDGATE WAS READY TO SAY IF MRS
 CASAUBON WOULD TAKE YOUR PLACETHERE WOULD BE GAIN INSTEAD OF LOSS
 BUT THERE WAS STILL A WEIGHT ONHIS MIND WHICH ARRESTED THIS CHEERFUL CANDOR
 HE REPLIED I SUPPOSETHEN THAT I MAY ENTER INTO THE SUBJECT WITH MRS
 CASAUBON
PRECISELY THAT IS WHAT SHE EXPRESSLY DESIRES
 HER DECISION SHE SAYSWILL MUCH DEPEND ON WHAT YOU CAN TELL HER
 BUT NOT AT PRESENT SHE ISI BELIEVE JUST SETTING OUT ON A JOURNEY
 I HAVE HER LETTER HERE SAIDMR
 BULSTRODE DRAWING IT OUT AND READING FROM IT
 I AM IMMEDIATELYOTHERWISE ENGAGED SHE SAYS
 I AM GOING INTO YORKSHIRE WITH SIR JAMESAND LADY CHETTAM AND THE CONCLUSIONS I COME TO ABOUT SOME LAND WHICH IAM TO SEE THERE MAY AFFECT MY POWER OF CONTRIBUTING TO THE HOSPITAL
THUS MR
 LYDGATE THERE IS NO HASTE NECESSARY IN THIS MATTER BUT IWISHED TO APPRISE YOU BEFOREHAND OF WHAT MAY POSSIBLY OCCUR
MR
 BULSTRODE RETURNED THE LETTER TO HIS SIDEPOCKET AND CHANGED HISATTITUDE AS IF HIS BUSINESS WERE CLOSED
 LYDGATE WHOSE RENEWED HOPEABOUT THE HOSPITAL ONLY MADE HIM MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE FACTS WHICHPOISONED HIS HOPE FELT THAT HIS EFFORT AFTER HELP IF MADE AT ALLMUST BE MADE NOW AND VIGOROUSLY
I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR GIVING ME FULL NOTICE HE SAID WITH AFIRM INTENTION IN HIS TONE YET WITH AN INTERRUPTEDNESS IN HIS DELIVERYWHICH SHOWED THAT HE SPOKE UNWILLINGLY
 THE HIGHEST OBJECT TO ME IS MYPROFESSION AND I HAD IDENTIFIED THE HOSPITAL WITH THE BEST USE I CANAT PRESENT MAKE OF MY PROFESSION
 BUT THE BEST USE IS NOT ALWAYS THESAME WITH MONETARY SUCCESS
 EVERYTHING WHICH HAS MADE THE HOSPITALUNPOPULAR HAS HELPED WITH OTHER CAUSESI THINK THEY ARE ALL CONNECTEDWITH MY PROFESSIONAL ZEALTO MAKE ME UNPOPULAR AS A PRACTITIONER
 I GETCHIEFLY PATIENTS WHO CANT PAY ME
 I SHOULD LIKE THEM BEST IF I HADNOBODY TO PAY ON MY OWN SIDE
 LYDGATE WAITED A LITTLE BUT BULSTRODEONLY BOWED LOOKING AT HIM FIXEDLY AND HE WENT ON WITH THE SAMEINTERRUPTED ENUNCIATIONAS IF HE WERE BITING AN OBJECTIONAL LEEK
I HAVE SLIPPED INTO MONEY DIFFICULTIES WHICH I CAN SEE NO WAY OUT OFUNLESS SOME ONE WHO TRUSTS ME AND MY FUTURE WILL ADVANCE ME A SUMWITHOUT OTHER SECURITY
 I HAD VERY LITTLE FORTUNE LEFT WHEN I CAMEHERE
 I HAVE NO PROSPECTS OF MONEY FROM MY OWN FAMILY
 MY EXPENSES INCONSEQUENCE OF MY MARRIAGE HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH GREATER THAN I HADEXPECTED
 THE RESULT AT THIS MOMENT IS THAT IT WOULD TAKE A THOUSANDPOUNDS TO CLEAR ME
 I MEAN TO FREE ME FROM THE RISK OF HAVING ALL MYGOODS SOLD IN SECURITY OF MY LARGEST DEBTAS WELL AS TO PAY MY OTHERDEBTSAND LEAVE ANYTHING TO KEEP US A LITTLE BEFOREHAND WITH OUR SMALLINCOME
 I FIND THAT IT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT MY WIFES FATHERSHOULD MAKE SUCH AN ADVANCE
 THAT IS WHY I MENTION MY POSITION TOTOTHE ONLY OTHER MAN WHO MAY BE HELD TO HAVE SOME PERSONAL CONNECTIONWITH MY PROSPERITY OR RUIN
LYDGATE HATED TO HEAR HIMSELF
 BUT HE HAD SPOKEN NOW AND HAD SPOKENWITH UNMISTAKABLE DIRECTNESS
 MR
 BULSTRODE REPLIED WITHOUT HASTE BUTALSO WITHOUT HESITATION
I AM GRIEVED THOUGH I CONFESS NOT SURPRISED BY THIS INFORMATIONMR
 LYDGATE
 FOR MY OWN PART I REGRETTED YOUR ALLIANCE WITH MYBROTHERINLAWS FAMILY WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN OF PRODIGAL HABITS ANDWHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN MUCH INDEBTED TO ME FOR SUSTAINMENT IN ITSPRESENT POSITION
 MY ADVICE TO YOU MR
 LYDGATE WOULD BE THAT INSTEADOF INVOLVING YOURSELF IN FURTHER OBLIGATIONS AND CONTINUING A DOUBTFULSTRUGGLE YOU SHOULD SIMPLY BECOME A BANKRUPT
THAT WOULD NOT IMPROVE MY PROSPECT SAID LYDGATE RISING AND SPEAKINGBITTERLY EVEN IF IT WERE A MORE AGREEABLE THING IN ITSELF
IT IS ALWAYS A TRIAL SAID MR
 BULSTRODE BUT TRIAL MY DEAR SIR ISOUR PORTION HERE AND IS A NEEDED CORRECTIVE
 I RECOMMEND YOU TO WEIGHTHE ADVICE I HAVE GIVEN
THANK YOU SAID LYDGATE NOT QUITE KNOWING WHAT HE SAID
 I HAVEOCCUPIED YOU TOO LONG
 GOODDAY

DANIEL MUSOPHILUS
THAT CHANGE OF PLAN AND SHIFTING OF INTEREST WHICH BULSTRODE STATED ORBETRAYED IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH LYDGATE HAD BEEN DETERMINED IN HIMBY SOME SEVERE EXPERIENCE WHICH HE HAD GONE THROUGH SINCE THE EPOCH OFMR
 LARCHERS SALE WHEN RAFFLES HAD RECOGNIZED WILL LADISLAW AND WHENTHE BANKER HAD IN VAIN ATTEMPTED AN ACT OF RESTITUTION WHICH MIGHT MOVEDIVINE PROVIDENCE TO ARREST PAINFUL CONSEQUENCES
HIS CERTAINTY THAT RAFFLES UNLESS HE WERE DEAD WOULD RETURN TOMIDDLEMARCH BEFORE LONG HAD BEEN JUSTIFIED
 ON CHRISTMAS EVE HE HADREAPPEARED AT THE SHRUBS
 BULSTRODE WAS AT HOME TO RECEIVE HIM ANDHINDER HIS COMMUNICATION WITH THE REST OF THE FAMILY BUT HE COULD NOTALTOGETHER HINDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE VISIT FROM COMPROMISINGHIMSELF AND ALARMING HIS WIFE
 RAFFLES PROVED MORE UNMANAGEABLE THAN HEHAD SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE IN HIS FORMER APPEARANCES HIS CHRONIC STATE OFMENTAL RESTLESSNESS THE GROWING EFFECT OF HABITUAL INTEMPERANCEQUICKLY SHAKING OFF EVERY IMPRESSION FROM WHAT WAS SAID TO HIM
 HEINSISTED ON STAYING IN THE HOUSE AND BULSTRODE WEIGHING TWO SETS OFEVILS FELT THAT THIS WAS AT LEAST NOT A WORSE ALTERNATIVE THAN HISGOING INTO THE TOWN
 HE KEPT HIM IN HIS OWN ROOM FOR THE EVENING ANDSAW HIM TO BED RAFFLES ALL THE WHILE AMUSING HIMSELF WITH THEANNOYANCE HE WAS CAUSING THIS DECENT AND HIGHLY PROSPEROUSFELLOWSINNER AN AMUSEMENT WHICH HE FACETIOUSLY EXPRESSED AS SYMPATHYWITH HIS FRIENDS PLEASURE IN ENTERTAINING A MAN WHO HAD BEENSERVICEABLE TO HIM AND WHO HAD NOT HAD ALL HIS EARNINGS
 THERE WAS ACUNNING CALCULATION UNDER THIS NOISY JOKINGA COOL RESOLVE TO EXTRACTSOMETHING THE HANDSOMER FROM BULSTRODE AS PAYMENT FOR RELEASE FROM THISNEW APPLICATION OF TORTURE
 BUT HIS CUNNING HAD A LITTLE OVERCAST ITSMARK
BULSTRODE WAS INDEED MORE TORTURED THAN THE COARSE FIBRE OF RAFFLESCOULD ENABLE HIM TO IMAGINE
 HE HAD TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE WAS SIMPLYTAKING CARE OF THIS WRETCHED CREATURE THE VICTIM OF VICE WHO MIGHTOTHERWISE INJURE HIMSELF HE IMPLIED WITHOUT THE DIRECT FORM OFFALSEHOOD THAT THERE WAS A FAMILY TIE WHICH BOUND HIM TO THIS CAREAND THAT THERE WERE SIGNS OF MENTAL ALIENATION IN RAFFLES WHICH URGEDCAUTION
 HE WOULD HIMSELF DRIVE THE UNFORTUNATE BEING AWAY THE NEXTMORNING
 IN THESE HINTS HE FELT THAT HE WAS SUPPLYING MRS
 BULSTRODEWITH PRECAUTIONARY INFORMATION FOR HIS DAUGHTERS AND SERVANTS ANDACCOUNTING FOR HIS ALLOWING NO ONE BUT HIMSELF TO ENTER THE ROOM EVENWITH FOOD AND DRINK
 BUT HE SAT IN AN AGONY OF FEAR LEST RAFFLES SHOULDBE OVERHEARD IN HIS LOUD AND PLAIN REFERENCES TO PAST FACTSLEST MRS
BULSTRODE SHOULD BE EVEN TEMPTED TO LISTEN AT THE DOOR
 HOW COULD HEHINDER HER HOW BETRAY HIS TERROR BY OPENING THE DOOR TO DETECT HER
SHE WAS A WOMAN OF HONEST DIRECT HABITS AND LITTLE LIKELY TO TAKE SOLOW A COURSE IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT PAINFUL KNOWLEDGE BUT FEAR WASSTRONGER THAN THE CALCULATION OF PROBABILITIES
IN THIS WAY RAFFLES HAD PUSHED THE TORTURE TOO FAR AND PRODUCED ANEFFECT WHICH HAD NOT BEEN IN HIS PLAN
 BY SHOWING HIMSELF HOPELESSLYUNMANAGEABLE HE HAD MADE BULSTRODE FEEL THAT A STRONG DEFIANCE WAS THEONLY RESOURCE LEFT
 AFTER TAKING RAFFLES TO BED THAT NIGHT THE BANKERORDERED HIS CLOSED CARRIAGE TO BE READY AT HALFPAST SEVEN THE NEXTMORNING
 AT SIX OCLOCK HE HAD ALREADY BEEN LONG DRESSED AND HAD SPENTSOME OF HIS WRETCHEDNESS IN PRAYER PLEADING HIS MOTIVES FOR AVERTINGTHE WORST EVIL IF IN ANYTHING HE HAD USED FALSITY AND SPOKEN WHAT WASNOT TRUE BEFORE GOD
 FOR BULSTRODE SHRANK FROM A DIRECT LIE WITH ANINTENSITY DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE NUMBER OF HIS MORE INDIRECT MISDEEDS
BUT MANY OF THESE MISDEEDS WERE LIKE THE SUBTLE MUSCULAR MOVEMENTSWHICH ARE NOT TAKEN ACCOUNT OF IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS THOUGH THEY BRINGABOUT THE END THAT WE FIX OUR MIND ON AND DESIRE
 AND IT IS ONLY WHATWE ARE VIVIDLY CONSCIOUS OF THAT WE CAN VIVIDLY IMAGINE TO BE SEEN BYOMNISCIENCE
BULSTRODE CARRIED HIS CANDLE TO THE BEDSIDE OF RAFFLES WHO WASAPPARENTLY IN A PAINFUL DREAM
 HE STOOD SILENT HOPING THAT THEPRESENCE OF THE LIGHT WOULD SERVE TO WAKEN THE SLEEPER GRADUALLY ANDGENTLY FOR HE FEARED SOME NOISE AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF A TOO SUDDENAWAKENING
 HE HAD WATCHED FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES OR MORE THESHUDDERINGS AND PANTINGS WHICH SEEMED LIKELY TO END IN WAKING WHENRAFFLES WITH A LONG HALFSTIFLED MOAN STARTED UP AND STARED ROUND HIMIN TERROR TREMBLING AND GASPING
 BUT HE MADE NO FURTHER NOISE ANDBULSTRODE SETTING DOWN THE CANDLE AWAITED HIS RECOVERY
IT WAS A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER BEFORE BULSTRODE WITH A COLDPEREMPTORINESS OF MANNER WHICH HE HAD NOT BEFORE SHOWN SAID I CAMETO CALL YOU THUS EARLY MR
 RAFFLES BECAUSE I HAVE ORDERED THECARRIAGE TO BE READY AT HALFPAST SEVEN AND INTEND MYSELF TO CONDUCTYOU AS FAR AS ILSELY WHERE YOU CAN EITHER TAKE THE RAILWAY OR AWAIT ACOACH
 RAFFLES WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK BUT BULSTRODE ANTICIPATED HIMIMPERIOUSLY WITH THE WORDS BE SILENT SIR AND HEAR WHAT I HAVE TOSAY
 I SHALL SUPPLY YOU WITH MONEY NOW AND I WILL FURNISH YOU WITH AREASONABLE SUM FROM TIME TO TIME ON YOUR APPLICATION TO ME BY LETTERBUT IF YOU CHOOSE TO PRESENT YOURSELF HERE AGAIN IF YOU RETURN TOMIDDLEMARCH IF YOU USE YOUR TONGUE IN A MANNER INJURIOUS TO ME YOUWILL HAVE TO LIVE ON SUCH FRUITS AS YOUR MALICE CAN BRING YOU WITHOUTHELP FROM ME
 NOBODY WILL PAY YOU WELL FOR BLASTING MY NAME I KNOW THEWORST YOU CAN DO AGAINST ME AND I SHALL BRAVE IT IF YOU DARE TO THRUSTYOURSELF UPON ME AGAIN
 GET UP SIR AND DO AS I ORDER YOU WITHOUTNOISE OR I WILL SEND FOR A POLICEMAN TO TAKE YOU OFF MY PREMISES ANDYOU MAY CARRY YOUR STORIES INTO EVERY POTHOUSE IN THE TOWN BUT YOUSHALL HAVE NO SIXPENCE FROM ME TO PAY YOUR EXPENSES THERE
BULSTRODE HAD RARELY IN HIS LIFE SPOKEN WITH SUCH NERVOUS ENERGY HEHAD BEEN DELIBERATING ON THIS SPEECH AND ITS PROBABLE EFFECTS THROUGH ALARGE PART OF THE NIGHT AND THOUGH HE DID NOT TRUST TO ITS ULTIMATELYSAVING HIM FROM ANY RETURN OF RAFFLES HE HAD CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS THEBEST THROW HE COULD MAKE
 IT SUCCEEDED IN ENFORCING SUBMISSION FROM THEJADED MAN THIS MORNING HIS EMPOISONED SYSTEM AT THIS MOMENT QUAILEDBEFORE BULSTRODES COLD RESOLUTE BEARING AND HE WAS TAKEN OFF QUIETLYIN THE CARRIAGE BEFORE THE FAMILY BREAKFAST TIME
 THE SERVANTS IMAGINEDHIM TO BE A POOR RELATION AND WERE NOT SURPRISED THAT A STRICT MANLIKE THEIR MASTER WHO HELD HIS HEAD HIGH IN THE WORLD SHOULD BEASHAMED OF SUCH A COUSIN AND WANT TO GET RID OF HIM
 THE BANKERS DRIVEOF TEN MILES WITH HIS HATED COMPANION WAS A DREARY BEGINNING OF THECHRISTMAS DAY BUT AT THE END OF THE DRIVE RAFFLES HAD RECOVERED HISSPIRITS AND PARTED IN A CONTENTMENT FOR WHICH THERE WAS THE GOODREASON THAT THE BANKER HAD GIVEN HIM A HUNDRED POUNDS
 VARIOUS MOTIVESURGED BULSTRODE TO THIS OPENHANDEDNESS BUT HE DID NOT HIMSELF INQUIRECLOSELY INTO ALL OF THEM
 AS HE HAD STOOD WATCHING RAFFLES IN HISUNEASY SLEEP IT HAD CERTAINLY ENTERED HIS MIND THAT THE MAN HAD BEENMUCH SHATTERED SINCE THE FIRST GIFT OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS
HE HAD TAKEN CARE TO REPEAT THE INCISIVE STATEMENT OF HIS RESOLVE NOTTO BE PLAYED ON ANY MORE AND HAD TRIED TO PENETRATE RAFFLES WITH THEFACT THAT HE HAD SHOWN THE RISKS OF BRIBING HIM TO BE QUITE EQUAL TOTHE RISKS OF DEFYING HIM
 BUT WHEN FREED FROM HIS REPULSIVE PRESENCEBULSTRODE RETURNED TO HIS QUIET HOME HE BROUGHT WITH HIM NO CONFIDENCETHAT HE HAD SECURED MORE THAN A RESPITE
 IT WAS AS IF HE HAD HAD ALOATHSOME DREAM AND COULD NOT SHAKE OFF ITS IMAGES WITH THEIR HATEFULKINDRED OF SENSATIONSAS IF ON ALL THE PLEASANT SURROUNDINGS OF HISLIFE A DANGEROUS REPTILE HAD LEFT HIS SLIMY TRACES
WHO CAN KNOW HOW MUCH OF HIS MOST INWARD LIFE IS MADE UP OF THETHOUGHTS HE BELIEVES OTHER MEN TO HAVE ABOUT HIM UNTIL THAT FABRIC OFOPINION IS THREATENED WITH RUIN
BULSTRODE WAS ONLY THE MORE CONSCIOUS THAT THERE WAS A DEPOSIT OFUNEASY PRESENTIMENT IN HIS WIFES MIND BECAUSE SHE CAREFULLY AVOIDEDANY ALLUSION TO IT
 HE HAD BEEN USED EVERY DAY TO TASTE THE FLAVOR OFSUPREMACY AND THE TRIBUTE OF COMPLETE DEFERENCE AND THE CERTAINTY THATHE WAS WATCHED OR MEASURED WITH A HIDDEN SUSPICION OF HIS HAVING SOMEDISCREDITABLE SECRET MADE HIS VOICE TOTTER WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING TOEDIFICATION
 FORESEEING TO MEN OF BULSTRODES ANXIOUS TEMPERAMENT ISOFTEN WORSE THAN SEEING AND HIS IMAGINATION CONTINUALLY HEIGHTENED THEANGUISH OF AN IMMINENT DISGRACE
 YES IMMINENT FOR IF HIS DEFIANCE OFRAFFLES DID NOT KEEP THE MAN AWAYAND THOUGH HE PRAYED FOR THIS RESULTHE HARDLY HOPED FOR ITTHE DISGRACE WAS CERTAIN
 IN VAIN HE SAID TOHIMSELF THAT IF PERMITTED IT WOULD BE A DIVINE VISITATION ACHASTISEMENT A PREPARATION HE RECOILED FROM THE IMAGINED BURNING ANDHE JUDGED THAT IT MUST BE MORE FOR THE DIVINE GLORY THAT HE SHOULDESCAPE DISHONOR
 THAT RECOIL HAD AT LAST URGED HIM TO MAKE PREPARATIONSFOR QUITTING MIDDLEMARCH
 IF EVIL TRUTH MUST BE REPORTED OF HIM HEWOULD THEN BE AT A LESS SCORCHING DISTANCE FROM THE CONTEMPT OF HIS OLDNEIGHBORS AND IN A NEW SCENE WHERE HIS LIFE WOULD NOT HAVE GATHEREDTHE SAME WIDE SENSIBILITY THE TORMENTOR IF HE PURSUED HIM WOULD BELESS FORMIDABLE
 TO LEAVE THE PLACE FINALLY WOULD HE KNEW BEEXTREMELY PAINFUL TO HIS WIFE AND ON OTHER GROUNDS HE WOULD HAVEPREFERRED TO STAY WHERE HE HAD STRUCK ROOT
 HENCE HE MADE HISPREPARATIONS AT FIRST IN A CONDITIONAL WAY WISHING TO LEAVE ON ALLSIDES AN OPENING FOR HIS RETURN AFTER BRIEF ABSENCE IF ANY FAVORABLEINTERVENTION OF PROVIDENCE SHOULD DISSIPATE HIS FEARS
 HE WAS PREPARINGTO TRANSFER HIS MANAGEMENT OF THE BANK AND TO GIVE UP ANY ACTIVECONTROL OF OTHER COMMERCIAL AFFAIRS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE GROUNDOF HIS FAILING HEALTH BUT WITHOUT EXCLUDING HIS FUTURE RESUMPTION OFSUCH WORK
 THE MEASURE WOULD CAUSE HIM SOME ADDED EXPENSE AND SOMEDIMINUTION OF INCOME BEYOND WHAT HE HAD ALREADY UNDERGONE FROM THEGENERAL DEPRESSION OF TRADE AND THE HOSPITAL PRESENTED ITSELF AS APRINCIPAL OBJECT OF OUTLAY ON WHICH HE COULD FAIRLY ECONOMIZE
THIS WAS THE EXPERIENCE WHICH HAD DETERMINED HIS CONVERSATION WITHLYDGATE
 BUT AT THIS TIME HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD MOST OF THEM GONE NOFARTHER THAN A STAGE AT WHICH HE COULD RECALL THEM IF THEY PROVED TO BEUNNECESSARY
 HE CONTINUALLY DEFERRED THE FINAL STEPS IN THE MIDST OFHIS FEARS LIKE MANY A MAN WHO IS IN DANGER OF SHIPWRECK OR OF BEINGDASHED FROM HIS CARRIAGE BY RUNAWAY HORSES HE HAD A CLINGINGIMPRESSION THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO HINDER THE WORST AND THAT TOSPOIL HIS LIFE BY A LATE TRANSPLANTATION MIGHT BE OVERHASTYESPECIALLYSINCE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO ACCOUNT SATISFACTORILY TO HIS WIFE FOR THEPROJECT OF THEIR INDEFINITE EXILE FROM THE ONLY PLACE WHERE SHE WOULDLIKE TO LIVE
AMONG THE AFFAIRS BULSTRODE HAD TO CARE FOR WAS THE MANAGEMENT OF THEFARM AT STONE COURT IN CASE OF HIS ABSENCE AND ON THIS AS WELL AS ONALL OTHER MATTERS CONNECTED WITH ANY HOUSES AND LAND HE POSSESSED IN ORABOUT MIDDLEMARCH HE HAD CONSULTED CALEB GARTH
 LIKE EVERY ONE ELSEWHO HAD BUSINESS OF THAT SORT HE WANTED TO GET THE AGENT WHO WAS MOREANXIOUS FOR HIS EMPLOYERS INTERESTS THAN HIS OWN
 WITH REGARD TO STONECOURT SINCE BULSTRODE WISHED TO RETAIN HIS HOLD ON THE STOCK AND TOHAVE AN ARRANGEMENT BY WHICH HE HIMSELF COULD IF HE CHOSE RESUME HISFAVORITE RECREATION OF SUPERINTENDENCE CALEB HAD ADVISED HIM NOT TOTRUST TO A MERE BAILIFF BUT TO LET THE LAND STOCK AND IMPLEMENTSYEARLY AND TAKE A PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE PROCEEDS
MAY I TRUST TO YOU TO FIND ME A TENANT ON THESE TERMS MR
 GARTH
SAID BULSTRODE
 AND WILL YOU MENTION TO ME THE YEARLY SUM WHICH WOULDREPAY YOU FOR MANAGING THESE AFFAIRS WHICH WE HAVE DISCUSSED TOGETHER
ILL THINK ABOUT IT SAID CALEB IN HIS BLUNT WAY
 ILL SEE HOW ICAN MAKE IT OUT
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN THAT HE HAD TO CONSIDER FRED VINCYS FUTURE MR
GARTH WOULD NOT PROBABLY HAVE BEEN GLAD OF ANY ADDITION TO HIS WORK OFWHICH HIS WIFE WAS ALWAYS FEARING AN EXCESS FOR HIM AS HE GREW OLDER
BUT ON QUITTING BULSTRODE AFTER THAT CONVERSATION A VERY ALLURING IDEAOCCURRED TO HIM ABOUT THIS SAID LETTING OF STONE COURT
 WHAT IFBULSTRODE WOULD AGREE TO HIS PLACING FRED VINCY THERE ON THEUNDERSTANDING THAT HE CALEB GARTH SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEMANAGEMENT
 IT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT SCHOOLING FOR FRED HE MIGHT MAKEA MODEST INCOME THERE AND STILL HAVE TIME LEFT TO GET KNOWLEDGE BYHELPING IN OTHER BUSINESS
 HE MENTIONED HIS NOTION TO MRS
 GARTH WITHSUCH EVIDENT DELIGHT THAT SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO CHILL HIS PLEASURE BYEXPRESSING HER CONSTANT FEAR OF HIS UNDERTAKING TOO MUCH
THE LAD WOULD BE AS HAPPY AS TWO HE SAID THROWING HIMSELF BACK INHIS CHAIR AND LOOKING RADIANT IF I COULD TELL HIM IT WAS ALLSETTLED
 THINK SUSAN
 HIS MIND HAD BEEN RUNNING ON THAT PLACE FORYEARS BEFORE OLD FEATHERSTONE DIED
 AND IT WOULD BE AS PRETTY A TURN OFTHINGS AS COULD BE THAT HE SHOULD HOLD THE PLACE IN A GOOD INDUSTRIOUSWAY AFTER ALLBY HIS TAKING TO BUSINESS
 FOR ITS LIKELY ENOUGHBULSTRODE MIGHT LET HIM GO ON AND GRADUALLY BUY THE STOCK
 HE HASNTMADE UP HIS MIND I CAN SEE WHETHER OR NOT HE SHALL SETTLE SOMEWHEREELSE AS A LASTING THING
 I NEVER WAS BETTER PLEASED WITH A NOTION IN MYLIFE
 AND THEN THE CHILDREN MIGHT BE MARRIED BYANDBY SUSAN
YOU WILL NOT GIVE ANY HINT OF THE PLAN TO FRED UNTIL YOU ARE SURETHAT BULSTRODE WOULD AGREE TO THE PLAN
 SAID MRS
 GARTH IN A TONE OFGENTLE CAUTION
 AND AS TO MARRIAGE CALEB WE OLD PEOPLE NEED NOT HELPTO HASTEN IT
OH I DONT KNOW SAID CALEB SWINGING HIS HEAD ASIDE
 MARRIAGE IS ATAMING THING
 FRED WOULD WANT LESS OF MY BIT AND BRIDLE
 HOWEVER ISHALL SAY NOTHING TILL I KNOW THE GROUND IM TREADING ON
 I SHALL SPEAKTO BULSTRODE AGAIN
HE TOOK HIS EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SO
 BULSTRODE HAD ANYTHINGBUT A WARM INTEREST IN HIS NEPHEW FRED VINCY BUT HE HAD A STRONG WISHTO SECURE MR
 GARTHS SERVICES ON MANY SCATTERED POINTS OF BUSINESS ATWHICH HE WAS SURE TO BE A CONSIDERABLE LOSER IF THEY WERE UNDER LESSCONSCIENTIOUS MANAGEMENT
 ON THAT GROUND HE MADE NO OBJECTION TO MR
GARTHS PROPOSAL AND THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER REASON WHY HE WAS NOTSORRY TO GIVE A CONSENT WHICH WAS TO BENEFIT ONE OF THE VINCY FAMILY
IT WAS THAT MRS
 BULSTRODE HAVING HEARD OF LYDGATES DEBTS HAD BEENANXIOUS TO KNOW WHETHER HER HUSBAND COULD NOT DO SOMETHING FOR POORROSAMOND AND HAD BEEN MUCH TROUBLED ON LEARNING FROM HIM THATLYDGATES AFFAIRS WERE NOT EASILY REMEDIABLE AND THAT THE WISEST PLANWAS TO LET THEM TAKE THEIR COURSE
 MRS
 BULSTRODE HAD THEN SAID FORTHE FIRST TIME I THINK YOU ARE ALWAYS A LITTLE HARD TOWARDS MYFAMILY NICHOLAS
 AND I AM SURE I HAVE NO REASON TO DENY ANY OF MYRELATIVES
 TOO WORLDLY THEY MAY BE BUT NO ONE EVER HAD TO SAY THATTHEY WERE NOT RESPECTABLE
MY DEAR HARRIET SAID MR
 BULSTRODE WINCING UNDER HIS WIFES EYESWHICH WERE FILLING WITH TEARS I HAVE SUPPLIED YOUR BROTHER WITH AGREAT DEAL OF CAPITAL
 I CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO TAKE CARE OF HIS MARRIEDCHILDREN
THAT SEEMED TO BE TRUE AND MRS
 BULSTRODES REMONSTRANCE SUBSIDED INTOPITY FOR POOR ROSAMOND WHOSE EXTRAVAGANT EDUCATION SHE HAD ALWAYSFORESEEN THE FRUITS OF
BUT REMEMBERING THAT DIALOGUE MR
 BULSTRODE FELT THAT WHEN HE HAD TOTALK TO HIS WIFE FULLY ABOUT HIS PLAN OF QUITTING MIDDLEMARCH HESHOULD BE GLAD TO TELL HER THAT HE HAD MADE AN ARRANGEMENT WHICH MIGHTBE FOR THE GOOD OF HER NEPHEW FRED
 AT PRESENT HE HAD MERELY MENTIONEDTO HER THAT HE THOUGHT OF SHUTTING UP THE SHRUBS FOR A FEW MONTHS ANDTAKING A HOUSE ON THE SOUTHERN COAST
HENCE MR
 GARTH GOT THE ASSURANCE HE DESIRED NAMELY THAT IN CASE OFBULSTRODES DEPARTURE FROM MIDDLEMARCH FOR AN INDEFINITE TIME FREDVINCY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HAVE THE TENANCY OF STONE COURT ON THE TERMSPROPOSED
CALEB WAS SO ELATED WITH HIS HOPE OF THIS NEAT TURN BEING GIVEN TOTHINGS THAT IF HIS SELFCONTROL HAD NOT BEEN BRACED BY A LITTLEAFFECTIONATE WIFELY SCOLDING HE WOULD HAVE BETRAYED EVERYTHING TOMARY WANTING TO GIVE THE CHILD COMFORT
 HOWEVER HE RESTRAINEDHIMSELF AND KEPT IN STRICT PRIVACY FROM FRED CERTAIN VISITS WHICH HEWAS MAKING TO STONE COURT IN ORDER TO LOOK MORE THOROUGHLY INTO THESTATE OF THE LAND AND STOCK AND TAKE A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE
 HE WASCERTAINLY MORE EAGER IN THESE VISITS THAN THE PROBABLE SPEED OF EVENTSREQUIRED HIM TO BE BUT HE WAS STIMULATED BY A FATHERLY DELIGHT INOCCUPYING HIS MIND WITH THIS BIT OF PROBABLE HAPPINESS WHICH HE HELD INSTORE LIKE A HIDDEN BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR FRED AND MARY
BUT SUPPOSE THE WHOLE SCHEME SHOULD TURN OUT TO BE A CASTLE IN THEAIR
 SAID MRS
 GARTH
WELL WELL REPLIED CALEB THE CASTLE WILL TUMBLE ABOUT NOBODYSHEAD
CHAPTER LXIX
IF THOU HAST HEARD A WORD LET IT DIE WITH THEE
ECCLESIASTICUS
MR
 BULSTRODE WAS STILL SEATED IN HIS MANAGERS ROOM AT THE BANK ABOUTTHREE OCLOCK OF THE SAME DAY ON WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED LYDGATE THEREWHEN THE CLERK ENTERED TO SAY THAT HIS HORSE WAS WAITING AND ALSO THATMR
 GARTH WAS OUTSIDE AND BEGGED TO SPEAK WITH HIM
BY ALL MEANS SAID BULSTRODE AND CALEB ENTERED
 PRAY SIT DOWN MR
GARTH CONTINUED THE BANKER IN HIS SUAVEST TONE
I AM GLAD THAT YOU ARRIVED JUST IN TIME TO FIND ME HERE
 I KNOW YOUCOUNT YOUR MINUTES
OH SAID CALEB GENTLY WITH A SLOW SWING OF HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE ASHE SEATED HIMSELF AND LAID HIS HAT ON THE FLOOR
HE LOOKED AT THE GROUND LEANING FORWARD AND LETTING HIS LONG FINGERSDROOP BETWEEN HIS LEGS WHILE EACH FINGER MOVED IN SUCCESSION AS IF ITWERE SHARING SOME THOUGHT WHICH FILLED HIS LARGE QUIET BROW
MR
 BULSTRODE LIKE EVERY ONE ELSE WHO KNEW CALEB WAS USED TO HISSLOWNESS IN BEGINNING TO SPEAK ON ANY TOPIC WHICH HE FELT TO BEIMPORTANT AND RATHER EXPECTED THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO RECUR TO THE BUYINGOF SOME HOUSES IN BLINDMANS COURT FOR THE SAKE OF PULLING THEM DOWNAS A SACRIFICE OF PROPERTY WHICH WOULD BE WELL REPAID BY THE INFLUX OFAIR AND LIGHT ON THAT SPOT
 IT WAS BY PROPOSITIONS OF THIS KIND THATCALEB WAS SOMETIMES TROUBLESOME TO HIS EMPLOYERS BUT HE HAD USUALLYFOUND BULSTRODE READY TO MEET HIM IN PROJECTS OF IMPROVEMENT AND THEYHAD GOT ON WELL TOGETHER
 WHEN HE SPOKE AGAIN HOWEVER IT WAS TO SAYIN RATHER A SUBDUED VOICEI HAVE JUST COME AWAY FROM STONE COURT MR
 BULSTRODE
YOU FOUND NOTHING WRONG THERE I HOPE SAID THE BANKER I WAS THEREMYSELF YESTERDAY
 ABEL HAS DONE WELL WITH THE LAMBS THIS YEAR
WHY YES SAID CALEB LOOKING UP GRAVELY THERE IS SOMETHING WRONGASTRANGER WHO IS VERY ILL I THINK
 HE WANTS A DOCTOR AND I CAME TOTELL YOU OF THAT
 HIS NAME IS RAFFLES
HE SAW THE SHOCK OF HIS WORDS PASSING THROUGH BULSTRODES FRAME
 ONTHIS SUBJECT THE BANKER HAD THOUGHT THAT HIS FEARS WERE TOO CONSTANTLYON THE WATCH TO BE TAKEN BY SURPRISE BUT HE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
POOR WRETCH
 HE SAID IN A COMPASSIONATE TONE THOUGH HIS LIPSTREMBLED A LITTLE
 DO YOU KNOW HOW HE CAME THERE
I TOOK HIM MYSELF SAID CALEB QUIETLYTOOK HIM UP IN MY GIG
 HE HADGOT DOWN FROM THE COACH AND WAS WALKING A LITTLE BEYOND THE TURNINGFROM THE TOLLHOUSE AND I OVERTOOK HIM
 HE REMEMBERED SEEING ME WITHYOU ONCE BEFORE AT STONE COURT AND HE ASKED ME TO TAKE HIM ON
 I SAWHE WAS ILL IT SEEMED TO ME THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO CARRY HIM UNDERSHELTER
 AND NOW I THINK YOU SHOULD LOSE NO TIME IN GETTING ADVICE FORHIM
 CALEB TOOK UP HIS HAT FROM THE FLOOR AS HE ENDED AND ROSE SLOWLYFROM HIS SEAT
CERTAINLY SAID BULSTRODE WHOSE MIND WAS VERY ACTIVE AT THIS MOMENT
PERHAPS YOU WILL YOURSELF OBLIGE ME MR
 GARTH BY CALLING AT MR
LYDGATES AS YOU PASSOR STAY
 HE MAY AT THIS HOUR PROBABLY BE AT THEHOSPITAL
 I WILL FIRST SEND MY MAN ON THE HORSE THERE WITH A NOTE THISINSTANT AND THEN I WILL MYSELF RIDE TO STONE COURT
BULSTRODE QUICKLY WROTE A NOTE AND WENT OUT HIMSELF TO GIVE THECOMMISSION TO HIS MAN
 WHEN HE RETURNED CALEB WAS STANDING AS BEFOREWITH ONE HAND ON THE BACK OF THE CHAIR HOLDING HIS HAT WITH THE OTHER
IN BULSTRODES MIND THE DOMINANT THOUGHT WAS PERHAPS RAFFLES ONLYSPOKE TO GARTH OF HIS ILLNESS
 GARTH MAY WONDER AS HE MUST HAVE DONEBEFORE AT THIS DISREPUTABLE FELLOWS CLAIMING INTIMACY WITH ME BUT HEWILL KNOW NOTHING
 AND HE IS FRIENDLY TO MEI CAN BE OF USE TO HIM
HE LONGED FOR SOME CONFIRMATION OF THIS HOPEFUL CONJECTURE BUT TO HAVEASKED ANY QUESTION AS TO WHAT RAFFLES HAD SAID OR DONE WOULD HAVE BEENTO BETRAY FEAR
I AM EXCEEDINGLY OBLIGED TO YOU MR
 GARTH HE SAID IN HIS USUALTONE OF POLITENESS
 MY SERVANT WILL BE BACK IN A FEW MINUTES AND ISHALL THEN GO MYSELF TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN
PERHAPS YOU HAD SOME OTHER BUSINESS WITH ME
 IF SO PRAY BE SEATED
THANK YOU SAID CALEB MAKING A SLIGHT GESTURE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND TOWAIVE THE INVITATION
 I WISH TO SAY MR
 BULSTRODE THAT I MUSTREQUEST YOU TO PUT YOUR BUSINESS INTO SOME OTHER HANDS THAN MINE
 I AMOBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR HANDSOME WAY OF MEETING MEABOUT THE LETTING OFSTONE COURT AND ALL OTHER BUSINESS
 BUT I MUST GIVE IT UP
 A SHARPCERTAINTY ENTERED LIKE A STAB INTO BULSTRODES SOUL
THIS IS SUDDEN MR
 GARTH WAS ALL HE COULD SAY AT FIRST
IT IS SAID CALEB BUT IT IS QUITE FIXED
 I MUST GIVE IT UP
HE SPOKE WITH A FIRMNESS WHICH WAS VERY GENTLE AND YET HE COULD SEETHAT BULSTRODE SEEMED TO COWER UNDER THAT GENTLENESS HIS FACE LOOKINGDRIED AND HIS EYES SWERVING AWAY FROM THE GLANCE WHICH RESTED ON HIM
CALEB FELT A DEEP PITY FOR HIM BUT HE COULD HAVE USED NO PRETEXTS TOACCOUNT FOR HIS RESOLVE EVEN IF THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN OF ANY USE
YOU HAVE BEEN LED TO THIS I APPREHEND BY SOME SLANDERS CONCERNING MEUTTERED BY THAT UNHAPPY CREATURE SAID BULSTRODE ANXIOUS NOW TO KNOWTHE UTMOST
THAT IS TRUE
 I CANT DENY THAT I ACT UPON WHAT I HEARD FROM HIM
YOU ARE A CONSCIENTIOUS MAN MR
 GARTHA MAN I TRUST WHO FEELSHIMSELF ACCOUNTABLE TO GOD
 YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO INJURE ME BY BEINGTOO READY TO BELIEVE A SLANDER SAID BULSTRODE CASTING ABOUT FORPLEAS THAT MIGHT BE ADAPTED TO HIS HEARERS MIND
 THAT IS A POORREASON FOR GIVING UP A CONNECTION WHICH I THINK I MAY SAY WILL BEMUTUALLY BENEFICIAL
I WOULD INJURE NO MAN IF I COULD HELP IT SAID CALEB EVEN IF ITHOUGHT GOD WINKED AT IT
 I HOPE I SHOULD HAVE A FEELING FOR MYFELLOWCREATURE
 BUT SIRI AM OBLIGED TO BELIEVE THAT THIS RAFFLES HASTOLD ME THE TRUTH
 AND I CANT BE HAPPY IN WORKING WITH YOU ORPROFITING BY YOU
 IT HURTS MY MIND
 I MUST BEG YOU TO SEEK ANOTHERAGENT
VERY WELL MR
 GARTH
 BUT I MUST AT LEAST CLAIM TO KNOW THE WORST THATHE HAS TOLD YOU
 I MUST KNOW WHAT IS THE FOUL SPEECH THAT I AM LIABLETO BE THE VICTIM OF SAID BULSTRODE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ANGERBEGINNING TO MINGLE WITH HIS HUMILIATION BEFORE THIS QUIET MAN WHORENOUNCED HIS BENEFITS
THATS NEEDLESS SAID CALEB WAVING HIS HAND BOWING HIS HEADSLIGHTLY AND NOT SWERVING FROM THE TONE WHICH HAD IN IT THE MERCIFULINTENTION TO SPARE THIS PITIABLE MAN
 WHAT HE HAS SAID TO ME WILLNEVER PASS FROM MY LIPS UNLESS SOMETHING NOW UNKNOWN FORCES IT FROMME
 IF YOU LED A HARMFUL LIFE FOR GAIN AND KEPT OTHERS OUT OF THEIRRIGHTS BY DECEIT TO GET THE MORE FOR YOURSELF I DARE SAY YOUREPENTYOU WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK AND CANT THAT MUST BE A BITTERTHINGCALEB PAUSED A MOMENT AND SHOOK HIS HEADIT IS NOT FOR ME TOMAKE YOUR LIFE HARDER TO YOU
BUT YOU DOYOU DO MAKE IT HARDER TO ME SAID BULSTRODE CONSTRAINEDINTO A GENUINE PLEADING CRY
 YOU MAKE IT HARDER TO ME BY TURNING YOURBACK ON ME
THAT IM FORCED TO DO SAID CALEB STILL MORE GENTLY LIFTING UP HISHAND
 I AM SORRY
 I DONT JUDGE YOU AND SAY HE IS WICKED AND I AMRIGHTEOUS
 GOD FORBID
 I DONT KNOW EVERYTHING
 A MAN MAY DO WRONG ANDHIS WILL MAY RISE CLEAR OUT OF IT THOUGH HE CANT GET HIS LIFE CLEAR
THATS A BAD PUNISHMENT
 IF IT IS SO WITH YOUWELL IM VERY SORRY FORYOU
 BUT I HAVE THAT FEELING INSIDE ME THAT I CANT GO ON WORKING WITHYOU
 THATS ALL MR
 BULSTRODE
 EVERYTHING ELSE IS BURIED SO FAR AS MYWILL GOES
 AND I WISH YOU GOODDAY
ONE MOMENT MR
 GARTH
 SAID BULSTRODE HURRIEDLY
 I MAY TRUST THENTO YOUR SOLEMN ASSURANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT REPEAT EITHER TO MAN ORWOMAN WHATEVEN IF IT HAVE ANY DEGREE OF TRUTH IN ITIS YET A MALICIOUSREPRESENTATION
 CALEBS WRATH WAS STIRRED AND HE SAID INDIGNANTLYWHY SHOULD I HAVE SAID IT IF I DIDNT MEAN IT
 I AM IN NO FEAR OF YOU
SUCH TALES AS THAT WILL NEVER TEMPT MY TONGUE
EXCUSE MEI AM AGITATEDI AM THE VICTIM OF THIS ABANDONED MAN
STOP A BIT
 YOU HAVE GOT TO CONSIDER WHETHER YOU DIDNT HELP TO MAKEHIM WORSE WHEN YOU PROFITED BY HIS VICES
YOU ARE WRONGING ME BY TOO READILY BELIEVING HIM SAID BULSTRODEOPPRESSED AS BY A NIGHTMARE WITH THE INABILITY TO DENY FLATLY WHATRAFFLES MIGHT HAVE SAID AND YET FEELING IT AN ESCAPE THAT CALEB HADNOT SO STATED IT TO HIM AS TO ASK FOR THAT FLAT DENIAL
NO SAID CALEB LIFTING HIS HAND DEPRECATINGLY I AM READY TOBELIEVE BETTER WHEN BETTER IS PROVED
 I ROB YOU OF NO GOOD CHANCE
 ASTO SPEAKING I HOLD IT A CRIME TO EXPOSE A MANS SIN UNLESS IM CLEARIT MUST BE DONE TO SAVE THE INNOCENT
 THAT IS MY WAY OF THINKING MR
BULSTRODE AND WHAT I SAY IVE NO NEED TO SWEAR
 I WISH YOU GOODDAY
SOME HOURS LATER WHEN HE WAS AT HOME CALEB SAID TO HIS WIFEINCIDENTALLY THAT HE HAD HAD SOME LITTLE DIFFERENCES WITH BULSTRODEAND THAT IN CONSEQUENCE HE HAD GIVEN UP ALL NOTION OF TAKING STONECOURT AND INDEED HAD RESIGNED DOING FURTHER BUSINESS FOR HIM
HE WAS DISPOSED TO INTERFERE TOO MUCH WAS HE
 SAID MRS
 GARTHIMAGINING THAT HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN TOUCHED ON HIS SENSITIVE POINT ANDNOT BEEN ALLOWED TO DO WHAT HE THOUGHT RIGHT AS TO MATERIALS AND MODESOF WORK
OH SAID CALEB BOWING HIS HEAD AND WAVING HIS HAND GRAVELY
 AND MRS
GARTH KNEW THAT THIS WAS A SIGN OF HIS NOT INTENDING TO SPEAK FURTHERON THE SUBJECT
AS FOR BULSTRODE HE HAD ALMOST IMMEDIATELY MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND SETOFF FOR STONE COURT BEING ANXIOUS TO ARRIVE THERE BEFORE LYDGATE
HIS MIND WAS CROWDED WITH IMAGES AND CONJECTURES WHICH WERE A LANGUAGETO HIS HOPES AND FEARS JUST AS WE HEAR TONES FROM THE VIBRATIONS WHICHSHAKE OUR WHOLE SYSTEM
 THE DEEP HUMILIATION WITH WHICH HE HAD WINCEDUNDER CALEB GARTHS KNOWLEDGE OF HIS PAST AND REJECTION OF HISPATRONAGE ALTERNATED WITH AND ALMOST GAVE WAY TO THE SENSE OF SAFETYIN THE FACT THAT GARTH AND NO OTHER HAD BEEN THE MAN TO WHOM RAFFLESHAD SPOKEN
 IT SEEMED TO HIM A SORT OF EARNEST THAT PROVIDENCE INTENDEDHIS RESCUE FROM WORSE CONSEQUENCES THE WAY BEING THUS LEFT OPEN FORTHE HOPE OF SECRECY
 THAT RAFFLES SHOULD BE AFFLICTED WITH ILLNESSTHAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LED TO STONE COURT RATHER THANELSEWHEREBULSTRODES HEART FLUTTERED AT THE VISION OF PROBABILITIESWHICH THESE EVENTS CONJURED UP
 IF IT SHOULD TURN OUT THAT HE WAS FREEDFROM ALL DANGER OF DISGRACEIF HE COULD BREATHE IN PERFECT LIBERTYHISLIFE SHOULD BE MORE CONSECRATED THAN IT HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
 HEMENTALLY LIFTED UP THIS VOW AS IF IT WOULD URGE THE RESULT HE LONGEDFORHE TRIED TO BELIEVE IN THE POTENCY OF THAT PRAYERFUL RESOLUTIONITSPOTENCY TO DETERMINE DEATH
 HE KNEW THAT HE OUGHT TO SAY THY WILL BEDONE AND HE SAID IT OFTEN
 BUT THE INTENSE DESIRE REMAINED THAT THEWILL OF GOD MIGHT BE THE DEATH OF THAT HATED MAN
YET WHEN HE ARRIVED AT STONE COURT HE COULD NOT SEE THE CHANGE INRAFFLES WITHOUT A SHOCK
 BUT FOR HIS PALLOR AND FEEBLENESS BULSTRODEWOULD HAVE CALLED THE CHANGE IN HIM ENTIRELY MENTAL
 INSTEAD OF HISLOUD TORMENTING MOOD HE SHOWED AN INTENSE VAGUE TERROR AND SEEMED TODEPRECATE BULSTRODES ANGER BECAUSE THE MONEY WAS ALL GONEHE HAD BEENROBBEDIT HAD HALF OF IT BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM
 HE HAD ONLY COME HEREBECAUSE HE WAS ILL AND SOMEBODY WAS HUNTING HIMSOMEBODY WAS AFTER HIMHE HAD TOLD NOBODY ANYTHING HE HAD KEPT HIS MOUTH SHUT
 BULSTRODE NOTKNOWING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE SYMPTOMS INTERPRETED THIS NEWNERVOUS SUSCEPTIBILITY INTO A MEANS OF ALARMING RAFFLES INTO TRUECONFESSIONS AND TAXED HIM WITH FALSEHOOD IN SAYING THAT HE HAD NOTTOLD ANYTHING SINCE HE HAD JUST TOLD THE MAN WHO TOOK HIM UP IN HISGIG AND BROUGHT HIM TO STONE COURT
 RAFFLES DENIED THIS WITH SOLEMNADJURATIONS THE FACT BEING THAT THE LINKS OF CONSCIOUSNESS WEREINTERRUPTED IN HIM AND THAT HIS MINUTE TERRORSTRICKEN NARRATIVE TOCALEB GARTH HAD BEEN DELIVERED UNDER A SET OF VISIONARY IMPULSES WHICHHAD DROPPED BACK INTO DARKNESS
BULSTRODES HEART SANK AGAIN AT THIS SIGN THAT HE COULD GET NO GRASPOVER THE WRETCHED MANS MIND AND THAT NO WORD OF RAFFLES COULD BETRUSTED AS TO THE FACT WHICH HE MOST WANTED TO KNOW NAMELY WHETHER ORNOT HE HAD REALLY KEPT SILENCE TO EVERY ONE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD EXCEPTCALEB GARTH
 THE HOUSEKEEPER HAD TOLD HIM WITHOUT THE LEAST CONSTRAINTOF MANNER THAT SINCE MR
 GARTH LEFT RAFFLES HAD ASKED HER FOR BEERAND AFTER THAT HAD NOT SPOKEN SEEMING VERY ILL
 ON THAT SIDE IT MIGHTBE CONCLUDED THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO BETRAYAL
 MRS
 ABEL THOUGHT LIKETHE SERVANTS AT THE SHRUBS THAT THE STRANGE MAN BELONGED TO THEUNPLEASANT KIN WHO ARE AMONG THE TROUBLES OF THE RICH SHE HAD ATFIRST REFERRED THE KINSHIP TO MR
 RIGG AND WHERE THERE WAS PROPERTYLEFT THE BUZZING PRESENCE OF SUCH LARGE BLUEBOTTLES SEEMED NATURALENOUGH
 HOW HE COULD BE KIN TO BULSTRODE AS WELL WAS NOT SO CLEARBUT MRS
 ABEL AGREED WITH HER HUSBAND THAT THERE WAS NO KNOWING APROPOSITION WHICH HAD A GREAT DEAL OF MENTAL FOOD FOR HER SO THAT SHESHOOK HER HEAD OVER IT WITHOUT FURTHER SPECULATION
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR LYDGATE ARRIVED
 BULSTRODE MET HIM OUTSIDE THEWAINSCOTED PARLOR WHERE RAFFLES WAS AND SAIDI HAVE CALLED YOU IN MR
 LYDGATE TO AN UNFORTUNATE MAN WHO WAS ONCEIN MY EMPLOYMENT MANY YEARS AGO
 AFTERWARDS HE WENT TO AMERICA ANDRETURNED I FEAR TO AN IDLE DISSOLUTE LIFE
 BEING DESTITUTE HE HAS ACLAIM ON ME
 HE WAS SLIGHTLY CONNECTED WITH RIGG THE FORMER OWNER OFTHIS PLACE AND IN CONSEQUENCE FOUND HIS WAY HERE
 I BELIEVE HE ISSERIOUSLY ILL APPARENTLY HIS MIND IS AFFECTED
 I FEEL BOUND TO DO THEUTMOST FOR HIM
LYDGATE WHO HAD THE REMEMBRANCE OF HIS LAST CONVERSATION WITHBULSTRODE STRONGLY UPON HIM WAS NOT DISPOSED TO SAY AN UNNECESSARYWORD TO HIM AND BOWED SLIGHTLY IN ANSWER TO THIS ACCOUNT BUT JUSTBEFORE ENTERING THE ROOM HE TURNED AUTOMATICALLY AND SAID WHAT IS HISNAME
TO KNOW NAMES BEING AS MUCH A PART OF THE MEDICAL MANSACCOMPLISHMENT AS OF THE PRACTICAL POLITICIANS
RAFFLES JOHN RAFFLES SAID BULSTRODE WHO HOPED THAT WHATEVER BECAMEOF RAFFLES LYDGATE WOULD NEVER KNOW ANY MORE OF HIM
WHEN HE HAD THOROUGHLY EXAMINED AND CONSIDERED THE PATIENT LYDGATEORDERED THAT HE SHOULD GO TO BED AND BE KEPT THERE IN AS COMPLETEQUIET AS POSSIBLE AND THEN WENT WITH BULSTRODE INTO ANOTHER ROOM
IT IS A SERIOUS CASE I APPREHEND SAID THE BANKER BEFORE LYDGATEBEGAN TO SPEAK
NOAND YES SAID LYDGATE HALF DUBIOUSLY
 IT IS DIFFICULT TO DECIDEAS TO THE POSSIBLE EFFECT OF LONGSTANDING COMPLICATIONS BUT THE MANHAD A ROBUST CONSTITUTION TO BEGIN WITH
 I SHOULD NOT EXPECT THISATTACK TO BE FATAL THOUGH OF COURSE THE SYSTEM IS IN A TICKLISH STATE
HE SHOULD BE WELL WATCHED AND ATTENDED TO
I WILL REMAIN HERE MYSELF SAID BULSTRODE
 MRS
 ABEL AND HER HUSBANDARE INEXPERIENCED
 I CAN EASILY REMAIN HERE FOR THE NIGHT IF YOU WILLOBLIGE ME BY TAKING A NOTE FOR MRS
 BULSTRODE
I SHOULD THINK THAT IS HARDLY NECESSARY SAID LYDGATE
 HE SEEMS TAMEAND TERRIFIED ENOUGH
 HE MIGHT BECOME MORE UNMANAGEABLE
 BUT THERE IS AMAN HEREIS THERE NOT
I HAVE MORE THAN ONCE STAYED HERE A FEW NIGHTS FOR THE SAKE OFSECLUSION SAID BULSTRODE INDIFFERENTLY I AM QUITE DISPOSED TO DOSO NOW
 MRS
 ABEL AND HER HUSBAND CAN RELIEVE OR AID ME IF NECESSARY
VERY WELL
 THEN I NEED GIVE MY DIRECTIONS ONLY TO YOU SAID LYDGATENOT FEELING SURPRISED AT A LITTLE PECULIARITY IN BULSTRODE
YOU THINK THEN THAT THE CASE IS HOPEFUL
 SAID BULSTRODE WHENLYDGATE HAD ENDED GIVING HIS ORDERS
UNLESS THERE TURN OUT TO BE FURTHER COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS I HAVE NOTAT PRESENT DETECTEDYES SAID LYDGATE
 HE MAY PASS ON TO A WORSESTAGE BUT I SHOULD NOT WONDER IF HE GOT BETTER IN A FEW DAYS BYADHERING TO THE TREATMENT I HAVE PRESCRIBED
 THERE MUST BE FIRMNESS
REMEMBER IF HE CALLS FOR LIQUORS OF ANY SORT NOT TO GIVE THEM TO HIM
IN MY OPINION MEN IN HIS CONDITION ARE OFTENER KILLED BY TREATMENTTHAN BY THE DISEASE
 STILL NEW SYMPTOMS MAY ARISE
 I SHALL COME AGAINTOMORROW MORNING
AFTER WAITING FOR THE NOTE TO BE CARRIED TO MRS
 BULSTRODE LYDGATERODE AWAY FORMING NO CONJECTURES IN THE FIRST INSTANCE ABOUT THEHISTORY OF RAFFLES BUT REHEARSING THE WHOLE ARGUMENT WHICH HAD LATELYBEEN MUCH STIRRED BY THE PUBLICATION OF DR
 WARES ABUNDANT EXPERIENCEIN AMERICA AS TO THE RIGHT WAY OF TREATING CASES OF ALCOHOLICPOISONING SUCH AS THIS
 LYDGATE WHEN ABROAD HAD ALREADY BEENINTERESTED IN THIS QUESTION HE WAS STRONGLY CONVINCED AGAINST THEPREVALENT PRACTICE OF ALLOWING ALCOHOL AND PERSISTENTLY ADMINISTERINGLARGE DOSES OF OPIUM AND HE HAD REPEATEDLY ACTED ON THIS CONVICTIONWITH A FAVORABLE RESULT
THE MAN IS IN A DISEASED STATE HE THOUGHT BUT THERES A GOOD DEALOF WEAR IN HIM STILL
 I SUPPOSE HE IS AN OBJECT OF CHARITY TOBULSTRODE
 IT IS CURIOUS WHAT PATCHES OF HARDNESS AND TENDERNESS LIESIDE BY SIDE IN MENS DISPOSITIONS
 BULSTRODE SEEMS THE MOSTUNSYMPATHETIC FELLOW I EVER SAW ABOUT SOME PEOPLE AND YET HE HAS TAKENNO END OF TROUBLE AND SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY ON BENEVOLENTOBJECTS
 I SUPPOSE HE HAS SOME TEST BY WHICH HE FINDS OUT WHOM HEAVENCARES FORHE HAS MADE UP HIS MIND THAT IT DOESNT CARE FOR ME
THIS STREAK OF BITTERNESS CAME FROM A PLENTEOUS SOURCE AND KEPTWIDENING IN THE CURRENT OF HIS THOUGHT AS HE NEARED LOWICK GATE
 HE HADNOT BEEN THERE SINCE HIS FIRST INTERVIEW WITH BULSTRODE IN THE MORNINGHAVING BEEN FOUND AT THE HOSPITAL BY THE BANKERS MESSENGER AND FORTHE FIRST TIME HE WAS RETURNING TO HIS HOME WITHOUT THE VISION OF ANYEXPEDIENT IN THE BACKGROUND WHICH LEFT HIM A HOPE OF RAISING MONEYENOUGH TO DELIVER HIM FROM THE COMING DESTITUTION OF EVERYTHING WHICHMADE HIS MARRIED LIFE TOLERABLEEVERYTHING WHICH SAVED HIM AND ROSAMONDFROM THAT BARE ISOLATION IN WHICH THEY WOULD BE FORCED TO RECOGNIZE HOWLITTLE OF A COMFORT THEY COULD BE TO EACH OTHER
 IT WAS MORE BEARABLETO DO WITHOUT TENDERNESS FOR HIMSELF THAN TO SEE THAT HIS OWNTENDERNESS COULD MAKE NO AMENDS FOR THE LACK OF OTHER THINGS TO HER
THE SUFFERINGS OF HIS OWN PRIDE FROM HUMILIATIONS PAST AND TO COME WEREKEEN ENOUGH YET THEY WERE HARDLY DISTINGUISHABLE TO HIMSELF FROM THATMORE ACUTE PAIN WHICH DOMINATED THEMTHE PAIN OF FORESEEING THATROSAMOND WOULD COME TO REGARD HIM CHIEFLY AS THE CAUSE OFDISAPPOINTMENT AND UNHAPPINESS TO HER
 HE HAD NEVER LIKED THEMAKESHIFTS OF POVERTY AND THEY HAD NEVER BEFORE ENTERED INTO HISPROSPECTS FOR HIMSELF BUT HE WAS BEGINNING NOW TO IMAGINE HOW TWOCREATURES WHO LOVED EACH OTHER AND HAD A STOCK OF THOUGHTS IN COMMONMIGHT LAUGH OVER THEIR SHABBY FURNITURE AND THEIR CALCULATIONS HOW FARTHEY COULD AFFORD BUTTER AND EGGS
 BUT THE GLIMPSE OF THAT POETRYSEEMED AS FAR OFF FROM HIM AS THE CARELESSNESS OF THE GOLDEN AGE INPOOR ROSAMONDS MIND THERE WAS NOT ROOM ENOUGH FOR LUXURIES TO LOOKSMALL IN
 HE GOT DOWN FROM HIS HORSE IN A VERY SAD MOOD AND WENT INTOTHE HOUSE NOT EXPECTING TO BE CHEERED EXCEPT BY HIS DINNER ANDREFLECTING THAT BEFORE THE EVENING CLOSED IT WOULD BE WISE TO TELLROSAMOND OF HIS APPLICATION TO BULSTRODE AND ITS FAILURE
 IT WOULD BEWELL NOT TO LOSE TIME IN PREPARING HER FOR THE WORST
BUT HIS DINNER WAITED LONG FOR HIM BEFORE HE WAS ABLE TO EAT IT
 FOR ONENTERING HE FOUND THAT DOVERS AGENT HAD ALREADY PUT A MAN IN THEHOUSE AND WHEN HE ASKED WHERE MRS
 LYDGATE WAS HE WAS TOLD THAT SHEWAS IN HER BEDROOM
 HE WENT UP AND FOUND HER STRETCHED ON THE BED PALEAND SILENT WITHOUT AN ANSWER EVEN IN HER FACE TO ANY WORD OR LOOK OFHIS
 HE SAT DOWN BY THE BED AND LEANING OVER HER SAID WITH ALMOST A CRYOF PRAYERFORGIVE ME FOR THIS MISERY MY POOR ROSAMOND
 LET US ONLY LOVE ONEANOTHER
SHE LOOKED AT HIM SILENTLY STILL WITH THE BLANK DESPAIR ON HER FACEBUT THEN THE TEARS BEGAN TO FILL HER BLUE EYES AND HER LIP TREMBLED
THE STRONG MAN HAD HAD TOO MUCH TO BEAR THAT DAY
 HE LET HIS HEAD FALLBESIDE HERS AND SOBBED
HE DID NOT HINDER HER FROM GOING TO HER FATHER EARLY IN THE MORNINGITSEEMED NOW THAT HE OUGHT NOT TO HINDER HER FROM DOING AS SHE PLEASED
IN HALF AN HOUR SHE CAME BACK AND SAID THAT PAPA AND MAMMA WISHED HERTO GO AND STAY WITH THEM WHILE THINGS WERE IN THIS MISERABLE STATE
PAPA SAID HE COULD DO NOTHING ABOUT THE DEBTIF HE PAID THIS THEREWOULD BE HALFADOZEN MORE
 SHE HAD BETTER COME BACK HOME AGAIN TILLLYDGATE HAD GOT A COMFORTABLE HOME FOR HER
 DO YOU OBJECT TERTIUS
DO AS YOU LIKE SAID LYDGATE
 BUT THINGS ARE NOT COMING TO A CRISISIMMEDIATELY
 THERE IS NO HURRY
I SHOULD NOT GO TILL TOMORROW SAID ROSAMOND I SHALL WANT TO PACKMY CLOTHES
OH I WOULD WAIT A LITTLE LONGER THAN TOMORROWTHERE IS NO KNOWINGWHAT MAY HAPPEN SAID LYDGATE WITH BITTER IRONY
 I MAY GET MY NECKBROKEN AND THAT MAY MAKE THINGS EASIER TO YOU
IT WAS LYDGATES MISFORTUNE AND ROSAMONDS TOO THAT HIS TENDERNESSTOWARDS HER WHICH WAS BOTH AN EMOTIONAL PROMPTING AND AWELLCONSIDERED RESOLVE WAS INEVITABLY INTERRUPTED BY THESE OUTBURSTSOF INDIGNATION EITHER IRONICAL OR REMONSTRANT
 SHE THOUGHT THEM TOTALLYUNWARRANTED AND THE REPULSION WHICH THIS EXCEPTIONAL SEVERITY EXCITEDIN HER WAS IN DANGER OF MAKING THE MORE PERSISTENT TENDERNESSUNACCEPTABLE
I SEE YOU DO NOT WISH ME TO GO SHE SAID WITH CHILL MILDNESS WHYCAN YOU NOT SAY SO WITHOUT THAT KIND OF VIOLENCE
 I SHALL STAY UNTILYOU REQUEST ME TO DO OTHERWISE
LYDGATE SAID NO MORE BUT WENT OUT ON HIS ROUNDS
 HE FELT BRUISED ANDSHATTERED AND THERE WAS A DARK LINE UNDER HIS EYES WHICH ROSAMOND HADNOT SEEN BEFORE
 SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO LOOK AT HIM
 TERTIUS HAD A WAYOF TAKING THINGS WHICH MADE THEM A GREAT DEAL WORSE FOR HER
CHAPTER LXX
OUR DEEDS STILL TRAVEL WITH US FROM AFARAND WHAT WE HAVE BEEN MAKES US WHAT WE ARE
BULSTRODES FIRST OBJECT AFTER LYDGATE HAD LEFT STONE COURT WAS TOEXAMINE RAFFLESS POCKETS WHICH HE IMAGINED WERE SURE TO CARRY SIGNSIN THE SHAPE OF HOTELBILLS OF THE PLACES HE HAD STOPPED IN IF HE HADNOT TOLD THE TRUTH IN SAYING THAT HE HAD COME STRAIGHT FROM LIVERPOOLBECAUSE HE WAS ILL AND HAD NO MONEY
 THERE WERE VARIOUS BILLS CRAMMEDINTO HIS POCKETBOOK BUT NONE OF A LATER DATE THAN CHRISTMAS AT ANYOTHER PLACE EXCEPT ONE WHICH BORE DATE THAT MORNING
 THIS WASCRUMPLED UP WITH A HANDBILL ABOUT A HORSEFAIR IN ONE OF HISTAILPOCKETS AND REPRESENTED THE COST OF THREE DAYS STAY AT AN INN ATBILKLEY WHERE THE FAIR WAS HELDA TOWN AT LEAST FORTY MILES FROMMIDDLEMARCH
 THE BILL WAS HEAVY AND SINCE RAFFLES HAD NO LUGGAGE WITHHIM IT SEEMED PROBABLE THAT HE HAD LEFT HIS PORTMANTEAU BEHIND INPAYMENT IN ORDER TO SAVE MONEY FOR HIS TRAVELLING FARE FOR HIS PURSEWAS EMPTY AND HE HAD ONLY A COUPLE OF SIXPENCES AND SOME LOOSE PENCEIN HIS POCKETS
BULSTRODE GATHERED A SENSE OF SAFETY FROM THESE INDICATIONS THATRAFFLES HAD REALLY KEPT AT A DISTANCE FROM MIDDLEMARCH SINCE HISMEMORABLE VISIT AT CHRISTMAS
 AT A DISTANCE AND AMONG PEOPLE WHO WERESTRANGERS TO BULSTRODE WHAT SATISFACTION COULD THERE BE TO RAFFLESSTORMENTING SELFMAGNIFYING VEIN IN TELLING OLD SCANDALOUS STORIESABOUT A MIDDLEMARCH BANKER
 AND WHAT HARM IF HE DID TALK
 THE CHIEFPOINT NOW WAS TO KEEP WATCH OVER HIM AS LONG AS THERE WAS ANY DANGER OFTHAT INTELLIGIBLE RAVING THAT UNACCOUNTABLE IMPULSE TO TELL WHICHSEEMED TO HAVE ACTED TOWARDS CALEB GARTH AND BULSTRODE FELT MUCHANXIETY LEST SOME SUCH IMPULSE SHOULD COME OVER HIM AT THE SIGHT OFLYDGATE
 HE SAT UP ALONE WITH HIM THROUGH THE NIGHT ONLY ORDERING THEHOUSEKEEPER TO LIE DOWN IN HER CLOTHES SO AS TO BE READY WHEN HECALLED HER ALLEGING HIS OWN INDISPOSITION TO SLEEP AND HIS ANXIETY TOCARRY OUT THE DOCTORS ORDERS
 HE DID CARRY THEM OUT FAITHFULLYALTHOUGH RAFFLES WAS INCESSANTLY ASKING FOR BRANDY AND DECLARING THATHE WAS SINKING AWAYTHAT THE EARTH WAS SINKING AWAY FROM UNDER HIM
 HEWAS RESTLESS AND SLEEPLESS BUT STILL QUAILING AND MANAGEABLE
 ON THEOFFER OF THE FOOD ORDERED BY LYDGATE WHICH HE REFUSED AND THE DENIALOF OTHER THINGS WHICH HE DEMANDED HE SEEMED TO CONCENTRATE ALL HISTERROR ON BULSTRODE IMPLORINGLY DEPRECATING HIS ANGER HIS REVENGE ONHIM BY STARVATION AND DECLARING WITH STRONG OATHS THAT HE HAD NEVERTOLD ANY MORTAL A WORD AGAINST HIM
 EVEN THIS BULSTRODE FELT THAT HEWOULD NOT HAVE LIKED LYDGATE TO HEAR BUT A MORE ALARMING SIGN OFFITFUL ALTERNATION IN HIS DELIRIUM WAS THAT INTHE MORNING TWILIGHTRAFFLES SUDDENLY SEEMED TO IMAGINE A DOCTOR PRESENT ADDRESSING HIM ANDDECLARING THAT BULSTRODE WANTED TO STARVE HIM TO DEATH OUT OF REVENGEFOR TELLING WHEN HE NEVER HAD TOLD
BULSTRODES NATIVE IMPERIOUSNESS AND STRENGTH OF DETERMINATION SERVEDHIM WELL
 THIS DELICATELOOKING MAN HIMSELF NERVOUSLY PERTURBED FOUNDTHE NEEDED STIMULUS IN HIS STRENUOUS CIRCUMSTANCES AND THROUGH THATDIFFICULT NIGHT AND MORNING WHILE HE HAD THE AIR OF AN ANIMATED CORPSERETURNED TO MOVEMENT WITHOUT WARMTH HOLDING THE MASTERY BY ITS CHILLIMPASSIBILITY HIS MIND WAS INTENSELY AT WORK THINKING OF WHAT HE HADTO GUARD AGAINST AND WHAT WOULD WIN HIM SECURITY
 WHATEVER PRAYERS HEMIGHT LIFT UP WHATEVER STATEMENTS HE MIGHT INWARDLY MAKE OF THIS MANSWRETCHED SPIRITUAL CONDITION AND THE DUTY HE HIMSELF WAS UNDER TOSUBMIT TO THE PUNISHMENT DIVINELY APPOINTED FOR HIM RATHER THAN TO WISHFOR EVIL TO ANOTHERTHROUGH ALL THIS EFFORT TO CONDENSE WORDS INTO ASOLID MENTAL STATE THERE PIERCED AND SPREAD WITH IRRESISTIBLEVIVIDNESS THE IMAGES OF THE EVENTS HE DESIRED
 AND IN THE TRAIN OFTHOSE IMAGES CAME THEIR APOLOGY
 HE COULD NOT BUT SEE THE DEATH OFRAFFLES AND SEE IN IT HIS OWN DELIVERANCE
 WHAT WAS THE REMOVAL OFTHIS WRETCHED CREATURE
 HE WAS IMPENITENTBUT WERE NOT PUBLIC CRIMINALSIMPENITENT
YET THE LAW DECIDED ON THEIR FATE
 SHOULD PROVIDENCE INTHIS CASE AWARD DEATH THERE WAS NO SIN IN CONTEMPLATING DEATH AS THEDESIRABLE ISSUEIF HE KEPT HIS HANDS FROM HASTENING ITIF HESCRUPULOUSLY DID WHAT WAS PRESCRIBED
 EVEN HERE THERE MIGHT BE AMISTAKE HUMAN PRESCRIPTIONS WERE FALLIBLE THINGS LYDGATE HAD SAIDTHAT TREATMENT HAD HASTENED DEATHWHY NOT HIS OWN METHOD OF TREATMENT
BUT OF COURSE INTENTION WAS EVERYTHING IN THE QUESTION OF RIGHT ANDWRONG
AND BULSTRODE SET HIMSELF TO KEEP HIS INTENTION SEPARATE FROM HISDESIRE
 HE INWARDLY DECLARED THAT HE INTENDED TO OBEY ORDERS
 WHYSHOULD HE HAVE GOT INTO ANY ARGUMENT ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF THESEORDERS
 IT WAS ONLY THE COMMON TRICK OF DESIREWHICH AVAILS ITSELF OFANY IRRELEVANT SCEPTICISM FINDING LARGER ROOM FOR ITSELF IN ALLUNCERTAINTY ABOUT EFFECTS IN EVERY OBSCURITY THAT LOOKS LIKE THEABSENCE OF LAW
 STILL HE DID OBEY THE ORDERS
HIS ANXIETIES CONTINUALLY GLANCED TOWARDS LYDGATE AND HIS REMEMBRANCEOF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THEM THE MORNING BEFORE WAS ACCOMPANIEDWITH SENSIBILITIES WHICH HAD NOT BEEN ROUSED AT ALL DURING THE ACTUALSCENE
 HE HAD THEN CARED BUT LITTLE ABOUT LYDGATES PAINFUL IMPRESSIONSWITH REGARD TO THE SUGGESTED CHANGE IN THE HOSPITAL OR ABOUT THEDISPOSITION TOWARDS HIMSELF WHICH WHAT HE HELD TO BE HIS JUSTIFIABLEREFUSAL OF A RATHER EXORBITANT REQUEST MIGHT CALL FORTH
 HE RECURRED TOTHE SCENE NOW WITH A PERCEPTION THAT HE HAD PROBABLY MADE LYDGATE HISENEMY AND WITH AN AWAKENED DESIRE TO PROPITIATE HIM OR RATHER TOCREATE IN HIM A STRONG SENSE OF PERSONAL OBLIGATION
 HE REGRETTED THATHE HAD NOT AT ONCE MADE EVEN AN UNREASONABLE MONEYSACRIFICE
 FOR INCASE OF UNPLEASANT SUSPICIONS OR EVEN KNOWLEDGE GATHERED FROM THERAVING OF RAFFLES BULSTRODE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT HE HAD A DEFENCE INLYDGATES MIND BY HAVING CONFERRED A MOMENTOUS BENEFIT ON HIM
 BUT THEREGRET HAD PERHAPS COME TOO LATE
STRANGE PITEOUS CONFLICT IN THE SOUL OF THIS UNHAPPY MAN WHO HADLONGED FOR YEARS TO BE BETTER THAN HE WASWHO HAD TAKEN HIS SELFISHPASSIONS INTO DISCIPLINE AND CLAD THEM IN SEVERE ROBES SO THAT HE HADWALKED WITH THEM AS A DEVOUT CHOIR TILL NOW THAT A TERROR HAD RISENAMONG THEM AND THEY COULD CHANT NO LONGER BUT THREW OUT THEIR COMMONCRIES FOR SAFETY
IT WAS NEARLY THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY BEFORE LYDGATE ARRIVED HE HADMEANT TO COME EARLIER BUT HAD BEEN DETAINED HE SAID AND HISSHATTERED LOOKS WERE NOTICED BY BALSTRODE
 BUT HE IMMEDIATELY THREWHIMSELF INTO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE PATIENT AND INQUIRED STRICTLYINTO ALL THAT HAD OCCURRED
 RAFFLES WAS WORSE WOULD TAKE HARDLY ANYFOOD WAS PERSISTENTLY WAKEFUL AND RESTLESSLY RAVING BUT STILL NOTVIOLENT
 CONTRARY TO BULSTRODES ALARMED EXPECTATION HE TOOK LITTLENOTICE OF LYDGATES PRESENCE AND CONTINUED TO TALK OR MURMURINCOHERENTLY
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM
 SAID BULSTRODE IN PRIVATE
THE SYMPTOMS ARE WORSE
YOU ARE LESS HOPEFUL
NO I STILL THINK HE MAY COME ROUND
 ARE YOU GOING TO STAY HEREYOURSELF
 SAID LYDGATE LOOKING AT BULSTRODE WITH AN ABRUPT QUESTIONWHICH MADE HIM UNEASY THOUGH IN REALITY IT WAS NOT DUE TO ANYSUSPICIOUS CONJECTURE
YES I THINK SO SAID BULSTRODE GOVERNING HIMSELF AND SPEAKING WITHDELIBERATION
 MRS
 BULSTRODE IS ADVISED OF THE REASONS WHICH DETAINME
 MRS
 ABEL AND HER HUSBAND ARE NOT EXPERIENCED ENOUGH TO BE LEFTQUITE ALONE AND THIS KIND OF RESPONSIBILITY IS SCARCELY INCLUDED INTHEIR SERVICE OF ME
 YOU HAVE SOME FRESH INSTRUCTIONS I PRESUME
THE CHIEF NEW INSTRUCTION THAT LYDGATE HAD TO GIVE WAS ON THEADMINISTRATION OF EXTREMELY MODERATE DOSES OF OPIUM IN CASE OF THESLEEPLESSNESS CONTINUING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS
 HE HAD TAKEN THEPRECAUTION OF BRINGING OPIUM IN HIS POCKET AND HE GAVE MINUTEDIRECTIONS TO BULSTRODE AS TO THE DOSES AND THE POINT AT WHICH THEYSHOULD CEASE
 HE INSISTED ON THE RISK OF NOT CEASING AND REPEATED HISORDER THAT NO ALCOHOL SHOULD BE GIVEN
FROM WHAT I SEE OF THE CASE HE ENDED NARCOTISM IS THE ONLY THING ISHOULD BE MUCH AFRAID OF
 HE MAY WEAR THROUGH EVEN WITHOUT MUCH FOOD
THERES A GOOD DEAL OF STRENGTH IN HIM
YOU LOOK ILL YOURSELF MR
 LYDGATEA MOST UNUSUAL I MAY SAYUNPRECEDENTED THING IN MY KNOWLEDGE OF YOU SAID BULSTRODE SHOWING ASOLICITUDE AS UNLIKE HIS INDIFFERENCE THE DAY BEFORE AS HIS PRESENTRECKLESSNESS ABOUT HIS OWN FATIGUE WAS UNLIKE HIS HABITUALSELFCHERISHING ANXIETY
 I FEAR YOU ARE HARASSED
YES I AM SAID LYDGATE BRUSQUELY HOLDING HIS HAT AND READY TO GO
SOMETHING NEW I FEAR SAID BULSTRODE INQUIRINGLY
 PRAY BE SEATED
NO THANK YOU SAID LYDGATE WITH SOME HAUTEUR
 I MENTIONED TO YOUYESTERDAY WHAT WAS THE STATE OF MY AFFAIRS
 THERE IS NOTHING TO ADDEXCEPT THAT THE EXECUTION HAS SINCE THEN BEEN ACTUALLY PUT INTO MYHOUSE
 ONE CAN TELL A GOOD DEAL OF TROUBLE IN A SHORT SENTENCE
 I WILLSAY GOOD MORNING
STAY MR
 LYDGATE STAY SAID BULSTRODE I HAVE BEEN RECONSIDERINGTHIS SUBJECT
 I WAS YESTERDAY TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND SAW ITSUPERFICIALLY
 MRS
 BULSTRODE IS ANXIOUS FOR HER NIECE AND I MYSELFSHOULD GRIEVE AT A CALAMITOUS CHANGE IN YOUR POSITION
 CLAIMS ON ME ARENUMEROUS BUT ON RECONSIDERATION I ESTEEM IT RIGHT THAT I SHOULD INCURA SMALL SACRIFICE RATHER THAN LEAVE YOU UNAIDED
 YOU SAID I THINKTHAT A THOUSAND POUNDS WOULD SUFFICE ENTIRELY TO FREE YOU FROM YOURBURTHENS AND ENABLE YOU TO RECOVER A FIRM STAND
YES SAID LYDGATE A GREAT LEAP OF JOY WITHIN HIM SURMOUNTING EVERYOTHER FEELING THAT WOULD PAY ALL MY DEBTS AND LEAVE ME A LITTLE ONHAND
 I COULD SET ABOUT ECONOMIZING IN OUR WAY OF LIVING
 AND BYANDBYMY PRACTICE MIGHT LOOK UP
IF YOU WILL WAIT A MOMENT MR
 LYDGATE I WILL DRAW A CHECK TO THATAMOUNT
 I AM AWARE THAT HELP TO BE EFFECTUAL IN THESE CASES SHOULD BETHOROUGH
WHILE BULSTRODE WROTE LYDGATE TURNED TO THE WINDOW THINKING OF HISHOMETHINKING OF HIS LIFE WITH ITS GOOD START SAVED FROM FRUSTRATIONITS GOOD PURPOSES STILL UNBROKEN
YOU CAN GIVE ME A NOTE OF HAND FOR THIS MR
 LYDGATE SAID THEBANKER ADVANCING TOWARDS HIM WITH THE CHECK
 AND BYANDBY I HOPEYOU MAY BE IN CIRCUMSTANCES GRADUALLY TO REPAY ME
 MEANWHILE I HAVEPLEASURE IN THINKING THAT YOU WILL BE RELEASED FROM FURTHERDIFFICULTY
I AM DEEPLY OBLIGED TO YOU SAID LYDGATE
 YOU HAVE RESTORED TO METHE PROSPECT OF WORKING WITH SOME HAPPINESS AND SOME CHANCE OF GOOD
IT APPEARED TO HIM A VERY NATURAL MOVEMENT IN BULSTRODE THAT HE SHOULDHAVE RECONSIDERED HIS REFUSAL IT CORRESPONDED WITH THE MORE MUNIFICENTSIDE OF HIS CHARACTER
 BUT AS HE PUT HIS HACK INTO A CANTER THAT HEMIGHT GET THE SOONER HOME AND TELL THE GOOD NEWS TO ROSAMOND AND GETCASH AT THE BANK TO PAY OVER TO DOVERS AGENT THERE CROSSED HIS MINDWITH AN UNPLEASANT IMPRESSION AS FROM A DARKWINGED FLIGHT OF EVILAUGURY ACROSS HIS VISION THE THOUGHT OF THAT CONTRAST IN HIMSELF WHICHA FEW MONTHS HAD BROUGHTTHAT HE SHOULD BE OVERJOYED AT BEING UNDER ASTRONG PERSONAL OBLIGATIONTHAT HE SHOULD BE OVERJOYED AT GETTING MONEYFOR HIMSELF FROM BULSTRODE
THE BANKER FELT THAT HE HAD DONE SOMETHING TO NULLIFY ONE CAUSE OFUNEASINESS AND YET HE WAS SCARCELY THE EASIER
 HE DID NOT MEASURE THEQUANTITY OF DISEASED MOTIVE WHICH HAD MADE HIM WISH FOR LYDGATESGOODWILL BUT THE QUANTITY WAS NONE THE LESS ACTIVELY THERE LIKE ANIRRITATING AGENT IN HIS BLOOD
 A MAN VOWS AND YET WILL NOT CAST AWAYTHE MEANS OF BREAKING HIS VOW
 IS IT THAT HE DISTINCTLY MEANS TO BREAKIT
 NOT AT ALL BUT THE DESIRES WHICH TEND TO BREAK IT ARE AT WORK INHIM DIMLY AND MAKE THEIR WAY INTO HIS IMAGINATION AND RELAX HISMUSCLES IN THE VERY MOMENTS WHEN HE IS TELLING HIMSELF OVER AGAIN THEREASONS FOR HIS VOW
 RAFFLES RECOVERING QUICKLY RETURNING TO THE FREEUSE OF HIS ODIOUS POWERSHOW COULD BULSTRODE WISH FOR THAT
 RAFFLESDEAD WAS THE IMAGE THAT BROUGHT RELEASE AND INDIRECTLY HE PRAYED FORTHAT WAY OF RELEASE BESEECHING THAT IF IT WERE POSSIBLE THE REST OFHIS DAYS HERE BELOW MIGHT BE FREED FROM THE THREAT OF AN IGNOMINY WHICHWOULD BREAK HIM UTTERLY AS AN INSTRUMENT OF GODS SERVICE
 LYDGATESOPINION WAS NOT ON THE SIDE OF PROMISE THAT THIS PRAYER WOULD BEFULFILLED AND AS THE DAY ADVANCED BULSTRODE FELT HIMSELF GETTINGIRRITATED AT THE PERSISTENT LIFE IN THIS MAN WHOM HE WOULD FAIN HAVESEEN SINKING INTO THE SILENCE OF DEATH IMPERIOUS WILL STIRREDMURDEROUS IMPULSES TOWARDS THIS BRUTE LIFE OVER WHICH WILL BY ITSELFHAD NO POWER
 HE SAID INWARDLY THAT HE WAS GETTING TOO MUCH WORN HEWOULD NOT SIT UP WITH THE PATIENT TONIGHT BUT LEAVE HIM TO MRS
 ABELWHO IF NECESSARY COULD CALL HER HUSBAND
AT SIX OCLOCK RAFFLES HAVING HAD ONLY FITFUL PERTURBED SNATCHES OFSLEEP FROM WHICH HE WAKED WITH FRESH RESTLESSNESS AND PERPETUAL CRIESTHAT HE WAS SINKING AWAY BULSTRODE BEGAN TO ADMINISTER THE OPIUMACCORDING TO LYDGATES DIRECTIONS
 AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR OR MOREHE CALLED MRS
 ABEL AND TOLD HER THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF UNFIT FORFURTHER WATCHING
 HE MUST NOW CONSIGN THE PATIENT TO HER CARE AND HEPROCEEDED TO REPEAT TO HER LYDGATES DIRECTIONS AS TO THE QUANTITY OFEACH DOSE
 MRS
 ABEL HAD NOT BEFORE KNOWN ANYTHING OF LYDGATESPRESCRIPTIONS SHE HAD SIMPLY PREPARED AND BROUGHT WHATEVER BULSTRODEORDERED AND HAD DONE WHAT HE POINTED OUT TO HER
 SHE BEGAN NOW TO ASKWHAT ELSE SHE SHOULD DO BESIDES ADMINISTERING THE OPIUM
NOTHING AT PRESENT EXCEPT THE OFFER OF THE SOUP OR THE SODAWATERYOU CAN COME TO ME FOR FURTHER DIRECTIONS
 UNLESS THERE IS ANYIMPORTANT CHANGE I SHALL NOT COME INTO THE ROOM AGAIN TONIGHT
 YOUWILL ASK YOUR HUSBAND FOR HELP IF NECESSARY
 I MUST GO TO BED EARLY
YOUVE MUCH NEED SIR IM SURE SAID MRS
 ABEL AND TO TAKESOMETHING MORE STRENGTHENING THAN WHAT YOUVE DONE
BULSTRODE WENT AWAY NOW WITHOUT ANXIETY AS TO WHAT RAFFLES MIGHT SAY INHIS RAVING WHICH HAD TAKEN ON A MUTTERING INCOHERENCE NOT LIKELY TOCREATE ANY DANGEROUS BELIEF
 AT ANY RATE HE MUST RISK THIS
 HE WENTDOWN INTO THE WAINSCOTED PARLOR FIRST AND BEGAN TO CONSIDER WHETHER HEWOULD NOT HAVE HIS HORSE SADDLED AND GO HOME BY THE MOONLIGHT AND GIVEUP CARING FOR EARTHLY CONSEQUENCES
 THEN HE WISHED THAT HE HAD BEGGEDLYDGATE TO COME AGAIN THAT EVENING
 PERHAPS HE MIGHT DELIVER ADIFFERENT OPINION AND THINK THAT RAFFLES WAS GETTING INTO A LESSHOPEFUL STATE
 SHOULD HE SEND FOR LYDGATE
 IF RAFFLES WERE REALLYGETTING WORSE AND SLOWLY DYING BULSTRODE FELT THAT HE COULD GO TO BEDAND SLEEP IN GRATITUDE TO PROVIDENCE
 BUT WAS HE WORSE
 LYDGATE MIGHTCOME AND SIMPLY SAY THAT HE WAS GOING ON AS HE EXPECTED AND PREDICTTHAT HE WOULD BYANDBY FALL INTO A GOOD SLEEP AND GET WELL
 WHAT WASTHE USE OF SENDING FOR HIM
 BULSTRODE SHRANK FROM THAT RESULT
 NO IDEASOR OPINIONS COULD HINDER HIM FROM SEEING THE ONE PROBABILITY TO BETHAT RAFFLES RECOVERED WOULD BE JUST THE SAME MAN AS BEFORE WITH HISSTRENGTH AS A TORMENTOR RENEWED OBLIGING HIM TO DRAG AWAY HIS WIFE TOSPEND HER YEARS APART FROM HER FRIENDS AND NATIVE PLACE CARRYING ANALIENATING SUSPICION AGAINST HIM IN HER HEART
HE HAD SAT AN HOUR AND A HALF IN THIS CONFLICT BY THE FIRELIGHT ONLYWHEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT MADE HIM RISE AND LIGHT THE BEDCANDLE WHICH HEHAD BROUGHT DOWN WITH HIM
 THE THOUGHT WAS THAT HE HAD NOT TOLD MRS
ABEL WHEN THE DOSES OF OPIUM MUST CEASE
HE TOOK HOLD OF THE CANDLESTICK BUT STOOD MOTIONLESS FOR A LONG WHILE
SHE MIGHT ALREADY HAVE GIVEN HIM MORE THAN LYDGATE HAD PRESCRIBED
 BUTIT WAS EXCUSABLE IN HIM THAT HE SHOULD FORGET PART OF AN ORDER IN HISPRESENT WEARIED CONDITION
 HE WALKED UPSTAIRS CANDLE IN HAND NOTKNOWING WHETHER HE SHOULD STRAIGHTWAY ENTER HIS OWN ROOM AND GO TO BEDOR TURN TO THE PATIENTS ROOM AND RECTIFY HIS OMISSION
 HE PAUSED INTHE PASSAGE WITH HIS FACE TURNED TOWARDS RAFFLESS ROOM AND HE COULDHEAR HIM MOANING AND MURMURING
 HE WAS NOT ASLEEP THEN
 WHO COULD KNOWTHAT LYDGATES PRESCRIPTION WOULD NOT BE BETTER DISOBEYED THANFOLLOWED SINCE THERE WAS STILL NO SLEEP
HE TURNED INTO HIS OWN ROOM
 BEFORE HE HAD QUITE UNDRESSED MRS
 ABELRAPPED AT THE DOOR HE OPENED IT AN INCH SO THAT HE COULD HEAR HERSPEAK LOW
IF YOU PLEASE SIR SHOULD I HAVE NO BRANDY NOR NOTHING TO GIVE THEPOOR CREETUR
 HE FEELS SINKING AWAY AND NOTHING ELSE WILL HESWALLERAND BUT LITTLE STRENGTH IN IT IF HE DIDONLY THE OPIUM
 AND HESAYS MORE AND MORE HES SINKING DOWN THROUGH THE EARTH
TO HER SURPRISE MR
 BULSTRODE DID NOT ANSWER
 A STRUGGLE WAS GOING ONWITHIN HIM
I THINK HE MUST DIE FOR WANT O SUPPORT IF HE GOES ON IN THAT WAY
WHEN I NURSED MY POOR MASTER MR
 ROBISSON I HAD TO GIVE HIM PORTWINEAND BRANDY CONSTANT AND A BIG GLASS AT A TIME ADDED MRS
 ABEL WITHA TOUCH OF REMONSTRANCE IN HER TONE
BUT AGAIN MR
 BULSTRODE DID NOT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY AND SHE CONTINUEDITS NOT A TIME TO SPARE WHEN PEOPLE ARE AT DEATHS DOOR NOR WOULDYOU WISH IT SIR IM SURE
 ELSE I SHOULD GIVE HIM OUR OWN BOTTLE ORUM AS WE KEEP BY US
 BUT A SITTERUP SO AS YOUVE BEEN AND DOINGEVERYTHING AS LAID IN YOUR POWERHERE A KEY WAS THRUST THROUGH THE INCH OF DOORWAY AND MR
 BULSTRODESAID HUSKILY THAT IS THE KEY OF THE WINECOOLER
 YOU WILL FIND PLENTYOF BRANDY THERE
EARLY IN THE MORNINGABOUT SIXMR
 BULSTRODE ROSE AND SPENT SOME TIMEIN PRAYER
 DOES ANY ONE SUPPOSE THAT PRIVATE PRAYER IS NECESSARILYCANDIDNECESSARILY GOES TO THE ROOTS OF ACTION
 PRIVATE PRAYER ISINAUDIBLE SPEECH AND SPEECH IS REPRESENTATIVE WHO CAN REPRESENTHIMSELF JUST AS HE IS EVEN IN HIS OWN REFLECTIONS
 BULSTRODE HAD NOTYET UNRAVELLED IN HIS THOUGHT THE CONFUSED PROMPTINGS OF THE LASTFOURANDTWENTY HOURS
HE LISTENED IN THE PASSAGE AND COULD HEAR HARD STERTOROUS BREATHING
THEN HE WALKED OUT IN THE GARDEN AND LOOKED AT THE EARLY RIME ON THEGRASS AND FRESH SPRING LEAVES
 WHEN HE REENTERED THE HOUSE HE FELTSTARTLED AT THE SIGHT OF MRS
 ABEL
HOW IS YOUR PATIENTASLEEP I THINK
 HE SAID WITH AN ATTEMPT ATCHEERFULNESS IN HIS TONE
HES GONE VERY DEEP SIR SAID MRS
 ABEL
 HE WENT OFF GRADUALBETWEEN THREE AND FOUR OCLOCK
 WOULD YOU PLEASE TO GO AND LOOK AT HIM
I THOUGHT IT NO HARM TO LEAVE HIM
 MY MANS GONE AFIELD AND THE LITTLEGIRLS SEEING TO THE KETTLES
BULSTRODE WENT UP
 AT A GLANCE HE KNEW THAT RAFFLES WAS NOT IN THESLEEP WHICH BRINGS REVIVAL BUT IN THE SLEEP WHICH STREAMS DEEPER ANDDEEPER INTO THE GULF OF DEATH
HE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM AND SAW A BOTTLE WITH SOME BRANDY IN IT ANDTHE ALMOST EMPTY OPIUM PHIAL
 HE PUT THE PHIAL OUT OF SIGHT ANDCARRIED THE BRANDYBOTTLE DOWNSTAIRS WITH HIM LOCKING IT AGAIN IN THEWINECOOLER
WHILE BREAKFASTING HE CONSIDERED WHETHER HE SHOULD RIDE TO MIDDLEMARCHAT ONCE OR WAIT FOR LYDGATES ARRIVAL
 HE DECIDED TO WAIT AND TOLDMRS
 ABEL THAT SHE MIGHT GO ABOUT HER WORKHE COULD WATCH IN THEBEDCHAMBER
AS HE SAT THERE AND BEHELD THE ENEMY OF HIS PEACE GOING IRREVOCABLYINTO SILENCE HE FELT MORE AT REST THAN HE HAD DONE FOR MANY MONTHS
HIS CONSCIENCE WAS SOOTHED BY THE ENFOLDING WING OF SECRECY WHICHSEEMED JUST THEN LIKE AN ANGEL SENT DOWN FOR HIS RELIEF
 HE DREW OUTHIS POCKETBOOK TO REVIEW VARIOUS MEMORANDA THERE AS TO THEARRANGEMENTS HE HAD PROJECTED AND PARTLY CARRIED OUT IN THE PROSPECT OFQUITTING MIDDLEMARCH AND CONSIDERED HOW FAR HE WOULD LET THEM STAND ORRECALL THEM NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE WOULD BE BRIEF
 SOME ECONOMIES WHICHHE FELT DESIRABLE MIGHT STILL FIND A SUITABLE OCCASION IN HIS TEMPORARYWITHDRAWAL FROM MANAGEMENT AND HE HOPED STILL THAT MRS
 CASAUBON WOULDTAKE A LARGE SHARE IN THE EXPENSES OF THE HOSPITAL
 IN THAT WAY THEMOMENTS PASSED UNTIL A CHANGE IN THE STERTOROUS BREATHING WAS MARKEDENOUGH TO DRAW HIS ATTENTION WHOLLY TO THE BED AND FORCED HIM TO THINKOF THE DEPARTING LIFE WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN SUBSERVIENT TO HIS OWNWHICHHE HAD ONCE BEEN GLAD TO FIND BASE ENOUGH FOR HIM TO ACT ON AS HEWOULD
 IT WAS HIS GLADNESS THEN WHICH IMPELLED HIM NOW TO BE GLAD THATTHE LIFE WAS AT AN END
AND WHO COULD SAY THAT THE DEATH OF RAFFLES HAD BEEN HASTENED
 WHO KNEWWHAT WOULD HAVE SAVED HIM
LYDGATE ARRIVED AT HALFPAST TEN IN TIME TO WITNESS THE FINAL PAUSE OFTHE BREATH
 WHEN HE ENTERED THE ROOM BULSTRODE OBSERVED A SUDDENEXPRESSION IN HIS FACE WHICH WAS NOT SO MUCH SURPRISE AS A RECOGNITIONTHAT HE HAD NOT JUDGED CORRECTLY
 HE STOOD BY THE BED IN SILENCE FORSOME TIME WITH HIS EYES TURNED ON THE DYING MAN BUT WITH THAT SUBDUEDACTIVITY OF EXPRESSION WHICH SHOWED THAT HE WAS CARRYING ON AN INWARDDEBATE
WHEN DID THIS CHANGE BEGIN
 SAID HE LOOKING AT BULSTRODE
I DID NOT WATCH BY HIM LAST NIGHT SAID BULSTRODE
 I WAS OVERWORNAND LEFT HIM UNDER MRS
 ABELS CARE
 SHE SAID THAT HE SANK INTO SLEEPBETWEEN THREE AND FOUR OCLOCK
 WHEN I CAME IN BEFORE EIGHT HE WASNEARLY IN THIS CONDITION
LYDGATE DID NOT ASK ANOTHER QUESTION BUT WATCHED IN SILENCE UNTIL HESAID ITS ALL OVER
THIS MORNING LYDGATE WAS IN A STATE OF RECOVERED HOPE AND FREEDOM
 HEHAD SET OUT ON HIS WORK WITH ALL HIS OLD ANIMATION AND FELT HIMSELFSTRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR ALL THE DEFICIENCIES OF HIS MARRIED LIFE
 AND HEWAS CONSCIOUS THAT BULSTRODE HAD BEEN A BENEFACTOR TO HIM
 BUT HE WASUNEASY ABOUT THIS CASE
 HE HAD NOT EXPECTED IT TO TERMINATE AS IT HADDONE
 YET HE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO PUT A QUESTION ON THE SUBJECT TOBULSTRODE WITHOUT APPEARING TO INSULT HIM AND IF HE EXAMINED THEHOUSEKEEPERWHY THE MAN WAS DEAD
 THERE SEEMED TO BE NO USE INIMPLYING THAT SOMEBODYS IGNORANCE OR IMPRUDENCE HAD KILLED HIM
 ANDAFTER ALL HE HIMSELF MIGHT BE WRONG
HE AND BULSTRODE RODE BACK TO MIDDLEMARCH TOGETHER TALKING OF MANYTHINGSCHIEFLY CHOLERA AND THE CHANCES OF THE REFORM BILL IN THE HOUSEOF LORDS AND THE FIRM RESOLVE OF THE POLITICAL UNIONS
 NOTHING WASSAID ABOUT RAFFLES EXCEPT THAT BULSTRODE MENTIONED THE NECESSITY OFHAVING A GRAVE FOR HIM IN LOWICK CHURCHYARD AND OBSERVED THAT SO FARAS HE KNEW THE POOR MAN HAD NO CONNECTIONS EXCEPT RIGG WHOM HE HADSTATED TO BE UNFRIENDLY TOWARDS HIM
ON RETURNING HOME LYDGATE HAD A VISIT FROM MR
 FAREBROTHER
 THE VICARHAD NOT BEEN IN THE TOWN THE DAY BEFORE BUT THE NEWS THAT THERE WAS ANEXECUTION IN LYDGATES HOUSE HAD GOT TO LOWICK BY THE EVENING HAVINGBEEN CARRIED BY MR
 SPICER SHOEMAKER AND PARISHCLERK WHO HAD IT FROMHIS BROTHER THE RESPECTABLE BELLHANGER IN LOWICK GATE
 SINCE THATEVENING WHEN LYDGATE HAD COME DOWN FROM THE BILLIARD ROOM WITH FREDVINCY MR
 FAREBROTHERS THOUGHTS ABOUT HIM HAD BEEN RATHER GLOOMY
PLAYING AT THE GREEN DRAGON ONCE OR OFTENER MIGHT HAVE BEEN A TRIFLE INANOTHER MAN BUT IN LYDGATE IT WAS ONE OF SEVERAL SIGNS THAT HE WASGETTING UNLIKE HIS FORMER SELF
 HE WAS BEGINNING TO DO THINGS FOR WHICHHE HAD FORMERLY EVEN AN EXCESSIVE SCORN
 WHATEVER CERTAINDISSATISFACTIONS IN MARRIAGE WHICH SOME SILLY TINKLINGS OF GOSSIP HADGIVEN HIM HINTS OF MIGHT HAVE TO DO WITH THIS CHANGE MR
 FAREBROTHERFELT SURE THAT IT WAS CHIEFLY CONNECTED WITH THE DEBTS WHICH WERE BEINGMORE AND MORE DISTINCTLY REPORTED AND HE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT ANY NOTIONOF LYDGATES HAVING RESOURCES OR FRIENDS IN THE BACKGROUND MUST BEQUITE ILLUSORY
 THE REBUFF HE HAD MET WITH IN HIS FIRST ATTEMPT TO WINLYDGATES CONFIDENCE DISINCLINED HIM TO A SECOND BUT THIS NEWS OF THEEXECUTION BEING ACTUALLY IN THE HOUSE DETERMINED THE VICAR TO OVERCOMEHIS RELUCTANCE
LYDGATE HAD JUST DISMISSED A POOR PATIENT IN WHOM HE WAS MUCHINTERESTED AND HE CAME FORWARD TO PUT OUT HIS HANDWITH AN OPENCHEERFULNESS WHICH SURPRISED MR
 FAREBROTHER
 COULD THIS TOO BE A PROUDREJECTION OF SYMPATHY AND HELP
 NEVER MIND THE SYMPATHY AND HELPSHOULD BE OFFERED
HOW ARE YOU LYDGATE
 I CAME TO SEE YOU BECAUSE I HAD HEARD SOMETHINGWHICH MADE ME ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU SAID THE VICAR IN THE TONE OF A GOODBROTHER ONLY THAT THERE WAS NO REPROACH IN IT
 THEY WERE BOTH SEATEDBY THIS TIME AND LYDGATE ANSWERED IMMEDIATELYI THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
 YOU HAD HEARD THAT THERE WAS ANEXECUTION IN THE HOUSE
YES IS IT TRUE
IT WAS TRUE SAID LYDGATE WITH AN AIR OF FREEDOM AS IF HE DID NOTMIND TALKING ABOUT THE AFFAIR NOW
 BUT THE DANGER IS OVER THE DEBT ISPAID
 I AM OUT OF MY DIFFICULTIES NOW I SHALL BE FREED FROM DEBTS ANDABLE I HOPE TO START AFRESH ON A BETTER PLAN
I AM VERY THANKFUL TO HEAR IT SAID THE VICAR FALLING BACK IN HISCHAIR AND SPEAKING WITH THAT LOWTONED QUICKNESS WHICH OFTEN FOLLOWSTHE REMOVAL OF A LOAD
 I LIKE THAT BETTER THAN ALL THE NEWS IN THETIMES
 I CONFESS I CAME TO YOU WITH A HEAVY HEART
THANK YOU FOR COMING SAID LYDGATE CORDIALLY
 I CAN ENJOY THEKINDNESS ALL THE MORE BECAUSE I AM HAPPIER
 I HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN AGOOD DEAL CRUSHED
 IM AFRAID I SHALL FIND THE BRUISES STILL PAINFULBYAND BY HE ADDED SMILING RATHER SADLY BUT JUST NOW I CAN ONLYFEEL THAT THE TORTURESCREW IS OFF
MR
 FAREBROTHER WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID EARNESTLY MYDEAR FELLOW LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION
 FORGIVE ME IF I TAKE ALIBERTY
I DONT BELIEVE YOU WILL ASK ANYTHING THAT OUGHT TO OFFEND ME
THENTHIS IS NECESSARY TO SET MY HEART QUITE AT RESTYOU HAVE NOTHAVEYOU
IN ORDER TO PAY YOUR DEBTS INCURRED ANOTHER DEBT WHICH MAY HARASSYOU WORSE HEREAFTER
NO SAID LYDGATE COLORING SLIGHTLY
 THERE IS NO REASON WHY I SHOULDNOT TELL YOUSINCE THE FACT IS SOTHAT THE PERSON TO WHOM I AM INDEBTEDIS BULSTRODE
 HE HAS MADE ME A VERY HANDSOME ADVANCEA THOUSANDPOUNDSAND HE CAN AFFORD TO WAIT FOR REPAYMENT
WELL THAT IS GENEROUS SAID MR
 FAREBROTHER COMPELLING HIMSELF TOAPPROVE OF THE MAN WHOM HE DISLIKED
 HIS DELICATE FEELING SHRANK FROMDWELLING EVEN IN HIS THOUGHT ON THE FACT THAT HE HAD ALWAYS URGEDLYDGATE TO AVOID ANY PERSONAL ENTANGLEMENT WITH BULSTRODE
 HE ADDEDIMMEDIATELY AND BULSTRODE MUST NATURALLY FEEL AN INTEREST IN YOURWELFARE AFTER YOU HAVE WORKED WITH HIM IN A WAY WHICH HAS PROBABLYREDUCED YOUR INCOME INSTEAD OF ADDING TO IT
 I AM GLAD TO THINK THAT HEHAS ACTED ACCORDINGLY
LYDGATE FELT UNCOMFORTABLE UNDER THESE KINDLY SUPPOSITIONS
 THEY MADEMORE DISTINCT WITHIN HIM THE UNEASY CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH HAD SHOWN ITSFIRST DIM STIRRINGS ONLY A FEW HOURS BEFORE THAT BULSTRODES MOTIVESFOR HIS SUDDEN BENEFICENCE FOLLOWING CLOSE UPON THE CHILLESTINDIFFERENCE MIGHT BE MERELY SELFISH
 HE LET THE KINDLY SUPPOSITIONSPASS
 HE COULD NOT TELL THE HISTORY OF THE LOAN BUT IT WAS MOREVIVIDLY PRESENT WITH HIM THAN EVER AS WELL AS THE FACT WHICH THE VICARDELICATELY IGNOREDTHAT THIS RELATION OF PERSONAL INDEBTEDNESS TOBULSTRODE WAS WHAT HE HAD ONCE BEEN MOST RESOLVED TO AVOID
HE BEGAN INSTEAD OF ANSWERING TO SPEAK OF HIS PROJECTED ECONOMIESAND OF HIS HAVING COME TO LOOK AT HIS LIFE FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OFVIEW
I SHALL SET UP A SURGERY HE SAID
 I REALLY THINK I MADE A MISTAKENEFFORT IN THAT RESPECT
 AND IF ROSAMOND WILL NOT MIND I SHALL TAKE ANAPPRENTICE
 I DONT LIKE THESE THINGS BUT IF ONE CARRIES THEM OUTFAITHFULLY THEY ARE NOT REALLY LOWERING
 I HAVE HAD A SEVERE GALLING TOBEGIN WITH THAT WILL MAKE THE SMALL RUBS SEEM EASY
POOR LYDGATE
 THE IF ROSAMOND WILL NOT MIND WHICH HAD FALLEN FROMHIM INVOLUNTARILY AS PART OF HIS THOUGHT WAS A SIGNIFICANT MARK OF THEYOKE HE BORE
 BUT MR
 FAREBROTHER WHOSE HOPES ENTERED STRONGLY INTOTHE SAME CURRENT WITH LYDGATES AND WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HIM THATCOULD NOW RAISE A MELANCHOLY PRESENTIMENT LEFT HIM WITH AFFECTIONATECONGRATULATION

MEASURE FOR MEASURE
FIVE DAYS AFTER THE DEATH OF RAFFLES MR
 BAMBRIDGE WAS STANDING AT HISLEISURE UNDER THE LARGE ARCHWAY LEADING INTO THE YARD OF THE GREENDRAGON
 HE WAS NOT FOND OF SOLITARY CONTEMPLATION BUT HE HAD ONLY JUSTCOME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND ANY HUMAN FIGURE STANDING AT EASE UNDER THEARCHWAY IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON WAS AS CERTAIN TO ATTRACT COMPANIONSHIPAS A PIGEON WHICH HAS FOUND SOMETHING WORTH PECKING AT
 IN THIS CASETHERE WAS NO MATERIAL OBJECT TO FEED UPON BUT THE EYE OF REASON SAW APROBABILITY OF MENTAL SUSTENANCE IN THE SHAPE OF GOSSIP
 MR
 HOPKINSTHE MEEKMANNERED DRAPER OPPOSITE WAS THE FIRST TO ACT ON THIS INWARDVISION BEING THE MORE AMBITIOUS OF A LITTLE MASCULINE TALK BECAUSE HISCUSTOMERS WERE CHIEFLY WOMEN
 MR
 BAMBRIDGE WAS RATHER CURT TO THEDRAPER FEELING THAT HOPKINS WAS OF COURSE GLAD TO TALK TO HIM BUTTHAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO WASTE MUCH OF HIS TALK ON HOPKINS
 SOONHOWEVER THERE WAS A SMALL CLUSTER OF MORE IMPORTANT LISTENERS WHOWERE EITHER DEPOSITED FROM THE PASSERSBY OR HAD SAUNTERED TO THE SPOTEXPRESSLY TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANYTHING GOING ON AT THE GREEN DRAGONAND MR
 BAMBRIDGE WAS FINDING IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO SAY MANY IMPRESSIVETHINGS ABOUT THE FINE STUDS HE HAD BEEN SEEING AND THE PURCHASES HE HADMADE ON A JOURNEY IN THE NORTH FROM WHICH HE HAD JUST RETURNED
GENTLEMEN PRESENT WERE ASSURED THAT WHEN THEY COULD SHOW HIM ANYTHINGTO CUT OUT A BLOOD MARE A BAY RISING FOUR WHICH WAS TO BE SEEN ATDONCASTER IF THEY CHOSE TO GO AND LOOK AT IT MR
 BAMBRIDGE WOULDGRATIFY THEM BY BEING SHOT FROM HERE TO HEREFORD
 ALSO A PAIR OFBLACKS WHICH HE WAS GOING TO PUT INTO THE BREAK RECALLED VIVIDLY TO HISMIND A PAIR WHICH HE HAD SOLD TO FAULKNER IN  FOR A HUNDREDGUINEAS AND WHICH FAULKNER HAD SOLD FOR A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MONTHSLATERANY GENT WHO COULD DISPROVE THIS STATEMENT BEING OFFERED THEPRIVILEGE OF CALLING MR
 BAMBRIDGE BY A VERY UGLY NAME UNTIL THEEXERCISE MADE HIS THROAT DRY
WHEN THE DISCOURSE WAS AT THIS POINT OF ANIMATION CAME UP MR
 FRANKHAWLEY
 HE WAS NOT A MAN TO COMPROMISE HIS DIGNITY BY LOUNGING AT THEGREEN DRAGON BUT HAPPENING TO PASS ALONG THE HIGH STREET AND SEEINGBAMBRIDGE ON THE OTHER SIDE HE TOOK SOME OF HIS LONG STRIDES ACROSS TOASK THE HORSEDEALER WHETHER HE HAD FOUND THE FIRSTRATE GIGHORSE WHICHHE HAD ENGAGED TO LOOK FOR
 MR
 HAWLEY WAS REQUESTED TO WAIT UNTIL HEHAD SEEN A GRAY SELECTED AT BILKLEY IF THAT DID NOT MEET HIS WISHES TOA HAIR BAMBRIDGE DID NOT KNOW A HORSE WHEN HE SAW IT WHICH SEEMED TOBE THE HIGHEST CONCEIVABLE UNLIKELIHOOD
 MR
 HAWLEY STANDING WITH HISBACK TO THE STREET WAS FIXING A TIME FOR LOOKING AT THE GRAY ANDSEEING IT TRIED WHEN A HORSEMAN PASSED SLOWLY BY
BULSTRODE
 SAID TWO OR THREE VOICES AT ONCE IN A LOW TONE ONE OFTHEM WHICH WAS THE DRAPERS RESPECTFULLY PREFIXING THE MR
 BUTNOBODY HAVING MORE INTENTION IN THIS INTERJECTURAL NAMING THAN IF THEYHAD SAID THE RIVERSTON COACH WHEN THAT VEHICLE APPEARED IN THEDISTANCE
 MR
 HAWLEY GAVE A CARELESS GLANCE ROUND AT BULSTRODES BACKBUT AS BAMBRIDGES EYES FOLLOWED IT HE MADE A SARCASTIC GRIMACE
BY JINGO
 THAT REMINDS ME HE BEGAN LOWERING HIS VOICE A LITTLE IPICKED UP SOMETHING ELSE AT BILKLEY BESIDES YOUR GIGHORSE MR
 HAWLEY
I PICKED UP A FINE STORY ABOUT BULSTRODE
 DO YOU KNOW HOW HE CAME BYHIS FORTUNE
 ANY GENTLEMAN WANTING A BIT OF CURIOUS INFORMATION I CANGIVE IT HIM FREE OF EXPENSE
 IF EVERYBODY GOT THEIR DESERTS BULSTRODEMIGHT HAVE HAD TO SAY HIS PRAYERS AT BOTANY BAY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
 SAID MR
 HAWLEY THRUSTING HIS HANDS INTO HISPOCKETS AND PUSHING A LITTLE FORWARD UNDER THE ARCHWAY
 IF BULSTRODESHOULD TURN OUT TO BE A RASCAL FRANK HAWLEY HAD A PROPHETIC SOUL
I HAD IT FROM A PARTY WHO WAS AN OLD CHUM OF BULSTRODES
 ILL TELLYOU WHERE I FIRST PICKED HIM UP SAID BAMBRIDGE WITH A SUDDEN GESTUREOF HIS FOREFINGER
 HE WAS AT LARCHERS SALE BUT I KNEW NOTHING OFHIM THENHE SLIPPED THROUGH MY FINGERSWAS AFTER BULSTRODE NO DOUBT
HE TELLS ME HE CAN TAP BULSTRODE TO ANY AMOUNT KNOWS ALL HIS SECRETS
HOWEVER HE BLABBED TO ME AT BILKLEY HE TAKES A STIFF GLASS
 DAMME IFI THINK HE MEANT TO TURN KINGS EVIDENCE BUT HES THAT SORT OFBRAGGING FELLOW THE BRAGGING RUNS OVER HEDGE AND DITCH WITH HIM TILLHED BRAG OF A SPAVIN AS IF IT UD FETCH MONEY
 A MAN SHOULD KNOW WHENTO PULL UP
 MR
 BAMBRIDGE MADE THIS REMARK WITH AN AIR OF DISGUSTSATISFIED THAT HIS OWN BRAGGING SHOWED A FINE SENSE OF THE MARKETABLE
WHATS THE MANS NAME
 WHERE CAN HE BE FOUND
 SAID MR
 HAWLEY
AS TO WHERE HE IS TO BE FOUND I LEFT HIM TO IT AT THE SARACENS HEADBUT HIS NAME IS RAFFLES
RAFFLES
 EXCLAIMED MR
 HOPKINS
 I FURNISHED HIS FUNERAL YESTERDAY
HE WAS BURIED AT LOWICK
 MR
 BULSTRODE FOLLOWED HIM
 A VERY DECENTFUNERAL
 THERE WAS A STRONG SENSATION AMONG THE LISTENERS
 MR
BAMBRIDGE GAVE AN EJACULATION IN WHICH BRIMSTONE WAS THE MILDESTWORD AND MR
 HAWLEY KNITTING HIS BROWS AND BENDING HIS HEAD FORWARDEXCLAIMED WHAT
WHERE DID THE MAN DIE
AT STONE COURT SAID THE DRAPER
 THE HOUSEKEEPER SAID HE WAS ARELATION OF THE MASTERS
 HE CAME THERE ILL ON FRIDAY
WHY IT WAS ON WEDNESDAY I TOOK A GLASS WITH HIM INTERPOSEDBAMBRIDGE
DID ANY DOCTOR ATTEND HIM
 SAID MR
 HAWLEYYES
 MR
 LYDGATE
 MR
 BULSTRODE SAT UP WITH HIM ONE NIGHT
 HE DIED THETHIRD MORNING
GO ON BAMBRIDGE SAID MR
 HAWLEY INSISTENTLY
 WHAT DID THIS FELLOWSAY ABOUT BULSTRODE
THE GROUP HAD ALREADY BECOME LARGER THE TOWNCLERKS PRESENCE BEING AGUARANTEE THAT SOMETHING WORTH LISTENING TO WAS GOING ON THERE AND MR
BAMBRIDGE DELIVERED HIS NARRATIVE IN THE HEARING OF SEVEN
 IT WASMAINLY WHAT WE KNOW INCLUDING THE FACT ABOUT WILL LADISLAW WITH SOMELOCAL COLOR AND CIRCUMSTANCE ADDED IT WAS WHAT BULSTRODE HAD DREADEDTHE BETRAYAL OFAND HOPED TO HAVE BURIED FOREVER WITH THE CORPSE OFRAFFLESIT WAS THAT HAUNTING GHOST OF HIS EARLIER LIFE WHICH AS HE RODEPAST THE ARCHWAY OF THE GREEN DRAGON HE WAS TRUSTING THAT PROVIDENCEHAD DELIVERED HIM FROM
 YES PROVIDENCE
 HE HAD NOT CONFESSED TOHIMSELF YET THAT HE HAD DONE ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF CONTRIVANCE TO THISEND HE HAD ACCEPTED WHAT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN OFFERED
 IT WASIMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE THAT HE HAD DONE ANYTHING WHICH HASTENED THEDEPARTURE OF THAT MANS SOUL
BUT THIS GOSSIP ABOUT BULSTRODE SPREAD THROUGH MIDDLEMARCH LIKE THESMELL OF FIRE
 MR
 FRANK HAWLEY FOLLOWED UP HIS INFORMATION BY SENDINGA CLERK WHOM HE COULD TRUST TO STONE COURT ON A PRETEXT OF INQUIRINGABOUT HAY BUT REALLY TO GATHER ALL THAT COULD BE LEARNED ABOUT RAFFLESAND HIS ILLNESS FROM MRS
 ABEL
 IN THIS WAY IT CAME TO HIS KNOWLEDGETHAT MR
 GARTH HAD CARRIED THE MAN TO STONE COURT IN HIS GIG AND MR
HAWLEY IN CONSEQUENCE TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING CALEB CALLING ATHIS OFFICE TO ASK WHETHER HE HAD TIME TO UNDERTAKE AN ARBITRATION IF ITWERE REQUIRED AND THEN ASKING HIM INCIDENTALLY ABOUT RAFFLES
 CALEBWAS BETRAYED INTO NO WORD INJURIOUS TO BULSTRODE BEYOND THE FACT WHICHHE WAS FORCED TO ADMIT THAT HE HAD GIVEN UP ACTING FOR HIM WITHIN THELAST WEEK
 MR HAWLEY DREW HIS INFERENCES AND FEELING CONVINCED THATRAFFLES HAD TOLD HIS STORY TO GARTH AND THAT GARTH HAD GIVEN UPBULSTRODES AFFAIRS IN CONSEQUENCE SAID SO A FEW HOURS LATER TO MR
TOLLER
 THE STATEMENT WAS PASSED ON UNTIL IT HAD QUITE LOST THE STAMPOF AN INFERENCE AND WAS TAKEN AS INFORMATION COMING STRAIGHT FROMGARTH SO THAT EVEN A DILIGENT HISTORIAN MIGHT HAVE CONCLUDED CALEB TOBE THE CHIEF PUBLISHER OF BULSTRODES MISDEMEANORS
MR
 HAWLEY WAS NOT SLOW TO PERCEIVE THAT THERE WAS NO HANDLE FOR THELAW EITHER IN THE REVELATIONS MADE BY RAFFLES OR IN THE CIRCUMSTANCESOF HIS DEATH
 HE HAD HIMSELF RIDDEN TO LOWICK VILLAGE THAT HE MIGHTLOOK AT THE REGISTER AND TALK OVER THE WHOLE MATTER WITH MR
FAREBROTHER WHO WAS NOT MORE SURPRISED THAN THE LAWYER THAT AN UGLYSECRET SHOULD HAVE COME TO LIGHT ABOUT BULSTRODE THOUGH HE HAD ALWAYSHAD JUSTICE ENOUGH IN HIM TO HINDER HIS ANTIPATHY FROM TURNING INTOCONCLUSIONS
 BUT WHILE THEY WERE TALKING ANOTHER COMBINATION WASSILENTLY GOING FORWARD IN MR
 FAREBROTHERS MIND WHICH FORESHADOWEDWHAT WAS SOON TO BE LOUDLY SPOKEN OF IN MIDDLEMARCH AS A NECESSARYPUTTING OF TWO AND TWO TOGETHER
 WITH THE REASONS WHICH KEPTBULSTRODE IN DREAD OF RAFFLES THERE FLASHED THE THOUGHT THAT THE DREADMIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH HIS MUNIFICENCE TOWARDS HIS MEDICALMAN AND THOUGH HE RESISTED THE SUGGESTION THAT IT HAD BEEN CONSCIOUSLYACCEPTED IN ANY WAY AS A BRIBE HE HAD A FOREBODING THAT THISCOMPLICATION OF THINGS MIGHT BE OF MALIGNANT EFFECT ON LYDGATESREPUTATION
 HE PERCEIVED THAT MR
 HAWLEY KNEW NOTHING AT PRESENT OF THESUDDEN RELIEF FROM DEBT AND HE HIMSELF WAS CAREFUL TO GLIDE AWAY FROMALL APPROACHES TOWARDS THE SUBJECT
WELL HE SAID WITH A DEEP BREATH WANTING TO WIND UP THE ILLIMITABLEDISCUSSION OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THOUGH NOTHING COULD BE LEGALLYPROVEN IT IS A STRANGE STORY
 SO OUR MERCURIAL LADISLAW HAS A QUEERGENEALOGY
 A HIGHSPIRITED YOUNG LADY AND A MUSICAL POLISH PATRIOT MADEA LIKELY ENOUGH STOCK FOR HIM TO SPRING FROM BUT I SHOULD NEVER HAVESUSPECTED A GRAFTING OF THE JEW PAWNBROKER
 HOWEVER THERES NO KNOWINGWHAT A MIXTURE WILL TURN OUT BEFOREHAND
 SOME SORTS OF DIRT SERVE TOCLARIFY
ITS JUST WHAT I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED SAID MR
 HAWLEY MOUNTING HISHORSE
 ANY CURSED ALIEN BLOOD JEW CORSICAN OR GYPSY
I KNOW HES ONE OF YOUR BLACK SHEEP HAWLEY
 BUT HE IS REALLY ADISINTERESTED UNWORLDLY FELLOW SAID MR
 FAREBROTHER SMILING
AY AY THAT IS YOUR WHIGGISH TWIST SAID MR
 HAWLEY WHO HAD BEEN INTHE HABIT OF SAYING APOLOGETICALLY THAT FAREBROTHER WAS SUCH A DAMNEDPLEASANT GOODHEARTED FELLOW YOU WOULD MISTAKE HIM FOR A TORY
MR
 HAWLEY RODE HOME WITHOUT THINKING OF LYDGATES ATTENDANCE ONRAFFLES IN ANY OTHER LIGHT THAN AS A PIECE OF EVIDENCE ON THE SIDE OFBULSTRODE
 BUT THE NEWS THAT LYDGATE HAD ALL AT ONCE BECOME ABLE NOTONLY TO GET RID OF THE EXECUTION IN HIS HOUSE BUT TO PAY ALL HIS DEBTSIN MIDDLEMARCH WAS SPREADING FAST GATHERING ROUND IT CONJECTURES ANDCOMMENTS WHICH GAVE IT NEW BODY AND IMPETUS AND SOON FILLING THE EARSOF OTHER PERSONS BESIDES MR
 HAWLEY WHO WERE NOT SLOW TO SEE ASIGNIFICANT RELATION BETWEEN THIS SUDDEN COMMAND OF MONEY ANDBULSTRODES DESIRE TO STIFLE THE SCANDAL OF RAFFLES
 THAT THE MONEYCAME FROM BULSTRODE WOULD INFALLIBLY HAVE BEEN GUESSED EVEN IF THEREHAD BEEN NO DIRECT EVIDENCE OF IT FOR IT HAD BEFOREHAND ENTERED INTOTHE GOSSIP ABOUT LYDGATES AFFAIRS THAT NEITHER HIS FATHERINLAW NORHIS OWN FAMILY WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR HIM AND DIRECT EVIDENCE WASFURNISHED NOT ONLY BY A CLERK AT THE BANK BUT BY INNOCENT MRS
BULSTRODE HERSELF WHO MENTIONED THE LOAN TO MRS
 PLYMDALE WHOMENTIONED IT TO HER DAUGHTERINLAW OF THE HOUSE OF TOLLER WHOMENTIONED IT GENERALLY
 THE BUSINESS WAS FELT TO BE SO PUBLIC ANDIMPORTANT THAT IT REQUIRED DINNERS TO FEED IT AND MANY INVITATIONSWERE JUST THEN ISSUED AND ACCEPTED ON THE STRENGTH OF THIS SCANDALCONCERNING BULSTRODE AND LYDGATE WIVES WIDOWS AND SINGLE LADIES TOOKTHEIR WORK AND WENT OUT TO TEA OFTENER THAN USUAL AND ALL PUBLICCONVIVIALITY FROM THE GREEN DRAGON TO DOLLOPS GATHERED A ZEST WHICHCOULD NOT BE WON FROM THE QUESTION WHETHER THE LORDS WOULD THROW OUTTHE REFORM BILL
FOR HARDLY ANYBODY DOUBTED THAT SOME SCANDALOUS REASON OR OTHER WAS ATTHE BOTTOM OF BULSTRODES LIBERALITY TO LYDGATE
 MR
 HAWLEY INDEED INTHE FIRST INSTANCE INVITED A SELECT PARTY INCLUDING THE TWOPHYSICIANS WITH MR TOLLER AND MR
 WRENCH EXPRESSLY TO HOLD A CLOSEDISCUSSION AS TO THE PROBABILITIES OF RAFFLESS ILLNESS RECITING TOTHEM ALL THE PARTICULARS WHICH HAD BEEN GATHERED FROM MRS
 ABEL INCONNECTION WITH LYDGATES CERTIFICATE THAT THE DEATH WAS DUE TODELIRIUM TREMENS AND THE MEDICAL GENTLEMEN WHO ALL STOODUNDISTURBEDLY ON THE OLD PATHS IN RELATION TO THIS DISEASE DECLAREDTHAT THEY COULD SEE NOTHING IN THESE PARTICULARS WHICH COULD BETRANSFORMED INTO A POSITIVE GROUND OF SUSPICION
 BUT THE MORAL GROUNDSOF SUSPICION REMAINED THE STRONG MOTIVES BULSTRODE CLEARLY HAD FORWISHING TO BE RID OF RAFFLES AND THE FACT THAT AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENTHE HAD GIVEN LYDGATE THE HELP WHICH HE MUST FOR SOME TIME HAVE KNOWNTHE NEED FOR THE DISPOSITION MOREOVER TO BELIEVE THAT BULSTRODEWOULD BE UNSCRUPULOUS AND THE ABSENCE OF ANY INDISPOSITION TO BELIEVETHAT LYDGATE MIGHT BE AS EASILY BRIBED AS OTHER HAUGHTYMINDED MEN WHENTHEY HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES IN WANT OF MONEY
 EVEN IF THE MONEY HAD BEENGIVEN MERELY TO MAKE HIM HOLD HIS TONGUE ABOUT THE SCANDAL OFBULSTRODES EARLIER LIFE THE FACT THREW AN ODIOUS LIGHT ON LYDGATEWHO HAD LONG BEEN SNEERED AT AS MAKING HIMSELF SUBSERVIENT TO THEBANKER FOR THE SAKE OF WORKING HIMSELF INTO PREDOMINANCE ANDDISCREDITING THE ELDER MEMBERS OF HIS PROFESSION
 HENCE IN SPITE OFTHE NEGATIVE AS TO ANY DIRECT SIGN OF GUILT IN RELATION TO THE DEATH ATSTONE COURT MR
 HAWLEYS SELECT PARTY BROKE UP WITH THE SENSE THAT THEAFFAIR HAD AN UGLY LOOK
BUT THIS VAGUE CONVICTION OF INDETERMINABLE GUILT WHICH WAS ENOUGH TOKEEP UP MUCH HEADSHAKING AND BITING INNUENDO EVEN AMONG SUBSTANTIALPROFESSIONAL SENIORS HAD FOR THE GENERAL MIND ALL THE SUPERIOR POWEROF MYSTERY OVER FACT
 EVERYBODY LIKED BETTER TO CONJECTURE HOW THETHING WAS THAN SIMPLY TO KNOW IT FOR CONJECTURE SOON BECAME MORECONFIDENT THAN KNOWLEDGE AND HAD A MORE LIBERAL ALLOWANCE FOR THEINCOMPATIBLE
 EVEN THE MORE DEFINITE SCANDAL CONCERNING BULSTRODESEARLIER LIFE WAS FOR SOME MINDS MELTED INTO THE MASS OF MYSTERY ASSO MUCH LIVELY METAL TO BE POURED OUT IN DIALOGUE AND TO TAKE SUCHFANTASTIC SHAPES AS HEAVEN PLEASED
THIS WAS THE TONE OF THOUGHT CHIEFLY SANCTIONED BY MRS
 DOLLOP THESPIRITED LANDLADY OF THE TANKARD IN SLAUGHTER LANE WHO HAD OFTEN TORESIST THE SHALLOW PRAGMATISM OF CUSTOMERS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT THEIRREPORTS FROM THE OUTER WORLD WERE OF EQUAL FORCE WITH WHAT HAD COMEUP IN HER MIND
 HOW IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO HER SHE DIDNT KNOW BUT ITWAS THERE BEFORE HER AS IF IT HAD BEEN SCORED WITH THE CHALK ON THECHIMNEYBOARD AS BULSTRODE SHOULD SAY HIS INSIDE WAS THAT BLACKAS IF THE HAIRS OF HIS HEAD KNOWED THE THOUGHTS OF HIS HEART HED TEAREM UP BY THE ROOTS
THATS ODD SAID MR
 LIMP A MEDITATIVE SHOEMAKER WITH WEAK EYES ANDA PIPING VOICE
 WHY I READ IN THE TRUMPET THAT WAS WHAT THE DUKE OFWELLINGTON SAID WHEN HE TURNED HIS COAT AND WENT OVER TO THE ROMANS
VERY LIKE SAID MRS
 DOLLOP
 IF ONE RASKILL SAID IT ITS MOREREASON WHY ANOTHER SHOULD
 BUT HYPOCRITE AS HES BEEN AND HOLDINGTHINGS WITH THAT HIGH HAND AS THERE WAS NO PARSON I THE COUNTRY GOODENOUGH FOR HIM HE WAS FORCED TO TAKE OLD HARRY INTO HIS COUNSEL ANDOLD HARRYS BEEN TOO MANY FOR HIM
AY AY HES A COMPLICE YOU CANT SEND OUT O THE COUNTRY SAID MR
CRABBE THE GLAZIER WHO GATHERED MUCH NEWS AND GROPED AMONG IT DIMLY
BUT BY WHAT I CAN MAKE OUT THERES THEM SAYS BULSTRODE WAS FORRUNNING AWAY FOR FEAR O BEING FOUND OUT BEFORE NOW
HELL BE DROVE AWAY WHETHER OR NO SAID MR
 DILL THE BARBER WHOHAD JUST DROPPED IN

 FLETCHER SAID SO HIMSELF
ITLL BE A BAD THING FOR THE TOWN THOUGH IF BULSTRODES MONEY GOESOUT OF IT SAID MR
 LIMP QUAVERINGLY
AH THERES BETTER FOLKS SPEND THEIR MONEY WORSE SAID A FIRMVOICEDDYER WHOSE CRIMSON HANDS LOOKED OUT OF KEEPING WITH HIS GOODNATUREDFACE
BUT HE WONT KEEP HIS MONEY BY WHAT I CAN MAKE OUT SAID THEGLAZIER
 DONT THEY SAY AS THERES SOMEBODY CAN STRIP IT OFF HIM
 BYWHAT I CAN UNDERSTAN THEY COULD TAKE EVERY PENNY OFF HIM IF THEYWENT TO LAWING
NO SUCH THING
 SAID THE BARBER WHO FELT HIMSELF A LITTLE ABOVE HISCOMPANY AT DOLLOPS BUT LIKED IT NONE THE WORSE
 FLETCHER SAYS ITSNO SUCH THING
 HE SAYS THEY MIGHT PROVE OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHOSE CHILDTHIS YOUNG LADISLAW WAS AND THEYD DO NO MORE THAN IF THEY PROVED ICAME OUT OF THE FENSHE COULDNT TOUCH A PENNY
LOOK YOU THERE NOW
 SAID MRS
 DOLLOP INDIGNANTLY
 I THANK THE LORDHE TOOK MY CHILDREN TO HIMSELF IF THATS ALL THE LAW CAN DO FOR THEMOTHERLESS
 THEN BY THAT ITS O NO USE WHO YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER IS
BUT AS TO LISTENING TO WHAT ONE LAWYER SAYS WITHOUT ASKING ANOTHERIWONDER AT A MAN O YOUR CLEVERNESS MR
 DILL

 FLETCHER MAY SAY THAT IF HELIKES BUT I SAY DONT FLETCHER ME
MR
 DILL AFFECTED TO LAUGH IN A COMPLIMENTARY WAY AT MRS
 DOLLOP AS AWOMAN WHO WAS MORE THAN A MATCH FOR THE LAWYERS BEING DISPOSED TOSUBMIT TO MUCH TWITTING FROM A LANDLADY WHO HAD A LONG SCORE AGAINSTHIM

MRS
 DOLLOP LOOKED ROUND WITH THE AIR OF A LANDLADY ACCUSTOMED TODOMINATE HER COMPANY
 THERE WAS A CHORUS OF ADHESION FROM THE MORECOURAGEOUS BUT MR
 LIMP AFTER TAKING A DRAUGHT PLACED HIS FLAT HANDSTOGETHER AND PRESSED THEM HARD BETWEEN HIS KNEES LOOKING DOWN AT THEMWITH BLEAREYED CONTEMPLATION AS IF THE SCORCHING POWER OF MRS
DOLLOPS SPEECH HAD QUITE DRIED UP AND NULLIFIED HIS WITS UNTIL THEYCOULD BE BROUGHT ROUND AGAIN BY FURTHER MOISTURE
WHY SHOULDNT THEY DIG THE MAN UP AND HAVE THE CROWNER
 SAID THEDYER
 ITS BEEN DONE MANY AND MANYS THE TIME
 IF THERES BEEN FOULPLAY THEY MIGHT FIND IT OUT
NOT THEY MR
 JONAS
 SAID MRS DOLLOP EMPHATICALLY
 I KNOW WHATDOCTORS ARE
 THEYRE A DEAL TOO CUNNING TO BE FOUND OUT
 AND THISDOCTOR LYDGATE THATS BEEN FOR CUTTING UP EVERYBODY BEFORE THE BREATHWAS WELL OUT O THEIR BODYITS PLAIN ENOUGH WHAT USE HE WANTED TO MAKEO LOOKING INTO RESPECTABLE PEOPLES INSIDES
 HE KNOWS DRUGS YOU MAYBE SURE AS YOU CAN NEITHER SMELL NOR SEE NEITHER BEFORE THEYRESWALLOWED NOR AFTER
 WHY IVE SEEN DROPS MYSELF ORDERED BY DOCTORGAMBIT AS IS OUR CLUB DOCTOR AND A GOOD CHARIKTER AND HAS BROUGHTMORE LIVE CHILDREN INTO THE WORLD NOR EVER ANOTHER I MIDDLEMARCHI SAYIVE SEEN DROPS MYSELF AS MADE NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER THEY WAS IN THEGLASS OR OUT AND YET HAVE GRIPED YOU THE NEXT DAY
 SO ILL LEAVE YOUROWN SENSE TO JUDGE
 DONT TELL ME
 ALL I SAY IS ITS A MERCY THEYDIDNT TAKE THIS DOCTOR LYDGATE ON TO OUR CLUB
 THERES MANY A MOTHERSCHILD MIGHT HA RUED IT
THE HEADS OF THIS DISCUSSION AT DOLLOPS HAD BEEN THE COMMON THEMEAMONG ALL CLASSES IN THE TOWN HAD BEEN CARRIED TO LOWICK PARSONAGE ONONE SIDE AND TO TIPTON GRANGE ON THE OTHER HAD COME FULLY TO THE EARSOF THE VINCY FAMILY AND HAD BEEN DISCUSSED WITH SAD REFERENCE TO POORHARRIET BY ALL MRS
 BULSTRODES FRIENDS BEFORE LYDGATE KNEWDISTINCTLY WHY PEOPLE WERE LOOKING STRANGELY AT HIM AND BEFOREBULSTRODE HIMSELF SUSPECTED THE BETRAYAL OF HIS SECRETS
 HE HAD NOTBEEN ACCUSTOMED TO VERY CORDIAL RELATIONS WITH HIS NEIGHBORS AND HENCEHE COULD NOT MISS THE SIGNS OF CORDIALITY MOREOVER HE HAD BEEN TAKINGJOURNEYS ON BUSINESS OF VARIOUS KINDS HAVING NOW MADE UP HIS MIND THATHE NEED NOT QUIT MIDDLEMARCH AND FEELING ABLE CONSEQUENTLY TODETERMINE ON MATTERS WHICH HE HAD BEFORE LEFT IN SUSPENSE
WE WILL MAKE A JOURNEY TO CHELTENHAM IN THE COURSE OF A MONTH OR TWOHE HAD SAID TO HIS WIFE
 THERE ARE GREAT SPIRITUAL ADVANTAGES TO BEHAD IN THAT TOWN ALONG WITH THE AIR AND THE WATERS AND SIX WEEKS THEREWILL BE EMINENTLY REFRESHING TO US
HE REALLY BELIEVED IN THE SPIRITUAL ADVANTAGES AND MEANT THAT HIS LIFEHENCEFORTH SHOULD BE THE MORE DEVOTED BECAUSE OF THOSE LATER SINS WHICHHE REPRESENTED TO HIMSELF AS HYPOTHETIC PRAYING HYPOTHETICALLY FORTHEIR PARDONIF I HAVE HEREIN TRANSGRESSED
AS TO THE HOSPITAL HE AVOIDED SAYING ANYTHING FURTHER TO LYDGATEFEARING TO MANIFEST A TOO SUDDEN CHANGE OF PLANS IMMEDIATELY ON THEDEATH OF RAFFLES
 IN HIS SECRET SOUL HE BELIEVED THAT LYDGATE SUSPECTEDHIS ORDERS TO HAVE BEEN INTENTIONALLY DISOBEYED AND SUSPECTING THIS HEMUST ALSO SUSPECT A MOTIVE
 BUT NOTHING HAD BEEN BETRAYED TO HIM AS TOTHE HISTORY OF RAFFLES AND BULSTRODE WAS ANXIOUS NOT TO DO ANYTHINGWHICH WOULD GIVE EMPHASIS TO HIS UNDEFINED SUSPICIONS
 AS TO ANYCERTAINTY THAT A PARTICULAR METHOD OF TREATMENT WOULD EITHER SAVE ORKILL LYDGATE HIMSELF WAS CONSTANTLY ARGUING AGAINST SUCH DOGMATISM HEHAD NO RIGHT TO SPEAK AND HE HAD EVERY MOTIVE FOR BEING SILENT
 HENCEBULSTRODE FELT HIMSELF PROVIDENTIALLY SECURED
 THE ONLY INCIDENT HE HADSTRONGLY WINCED UNDER HAD BEEN AN OCCASIONAL ENCOUNTER WITH CALEBGARTH WHO HOWEVER HAD RAISED HIS HAT WITH MILD GRAVITY
MEANWHILE ON THE PART OF THE PRINCIPAL TOWNSMEN A STRONG DETERMINATIONWAS GROWING AGAINST HIM
A MEETING WAS TO BE HELD IN THE TOWNHALL ON A SANITARY QUESTION WHICHHAD RISEN INTO PRESSING IMPORTANCE BY THE OCCURRENCE OF A CHOLERA CASEIN THE TOWN
 SINCE THE ACT OF PARLIAMENT WHICH HAD BEEN HURRIEDLYPASSED AUTHORIZING ASSESSMENTS FOR SANITARY MEASURES THERE HAD BEEN ABOARD FOR THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF SUCH MEASURES APPOINTED INMIDDLEMARCH AND MUCH CLEANSING AND PREPARATION HAD BEEN CONCURRED INBY WHIGS AND TORIES
 THE QUESTION NOW WAS WHETHER A PIECE OF GROUNDOUTSIDE THE TOWN SHOULD BE SECURED AS A BURIALGROUND BY MEANS OFASSESSMENT OR BY PRIVATE SUBSCRIPTION
 THE MEETING WAS TO BE OPEN ANDALMOST EVERYBODY OF IMPORTANCE IN THE TOWN WAS EXPECTED TO BE THERE
MR
 BULSTRODE WAS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD AND JUST BEFORE TWELVE OCLOCKHE STARTED FROM THE BANK WITH THE INTENTION OF URGING THE PLAN OFPRIVATE SUBSCRIPTION
 UNDER THE HESITATION OF HIS PROJECTS HE HAD FORSOME TIME KEPT HIMSELF IN THE BACKGROUND AND HE FELT THAT HE SHOULDTHIS MORNING RESUME HIS OLD POSITION AS A MAN OF ACTION AND INFLUENCEIN THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS OF THE TOWN WHERE HE EXPECTED TO END HIS DAYS
AMONG THE VARIOUS PERSONS GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION HE SAW LYDGATETHEY JOINED TALKED OVER THE OBJECT OF THE MEETING AND ENTERED ITTOGETHER
IT SEEMED THAT EVERYBODY OF MARK HAD BEEN EARLIER THAN THEY
 BUT THEREWERE STILL SPACES LEFT NEAR THE HEAD OF THE LARGE CENTRAL TABLE ANDTHEY MADE THEIR WAY THITHER
 MR
 FAREBROTHER SAT OPPOSITE NOT FAR FROMMR
 HAWLEY ALL THE MEDICAL MEN WERE THERE MR
 THESIGER WAS IN THECHAIR AND MR
 BROOKE OF TIPTON WAS ON HIS RIGHT HAND
LYDGATE NOTICED A PECULIAR INTERCHANGE OF GLANCES WHEN HE AND BULSTRODETOOK THEIR SEATS
AFTER THE BUSINESS HAD BEEN FULLY OPENED BY THE CHAIRMAN WHO POINTEDOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF PURCHASING BY SUBSCRIPTION A PIECE OF GROUNDLARGE ENOUGH TO BE ULTIMATELY USED AS A GENERAL CEMETERY MR
BULSTRODE WHOSE RATHER HIGHPITCHED BUT SUBDUED AND FLUENT VOICE THETOWN WAS USED TO AT MEETINGS OF THIS SORT ROSE AND ASKED LEAVE TODELIVER HIS OPINION
 LYDGATE COULD SEE AGAIN THE PECULIAR INTERCHANGEOF GLANCES BEFORE MR
 HAWLEY STARTED UP AND SAID IN HIS FIRM RESONANTVOICE MR
 CHAIRMAN I REQUEST THAT BEFORE ANY ONE DELIVERS HISOPINION ON THIS POINT I MAY BE PERMITTED TO SPEAK ON A QUESTION OFPUBLIC FEELING WHICH NOT ONLY BY MYSELF BUT BY MANY GENTLEMENPRESENT IS REGARDED AS PRELIMINARY
MR
 HAWLEYS MODE OF SPEECH EVEN WHEN PUBLIC DECORUM REPRESSED HISAWFUL LANGUAGE WAS FORMIDABLE IN ITS CURTNESS AND SELFPOSSESSION
MR
 THESIGER SANCTIONED THE REQUEST MR
 BULSTRODE SAT DOWN AND MR
HAWLEY CONTINUED
IN WHAT I HAVE TO SAY MR
 CHAIRMAN I AM NOT SPEAKING SIMPLY ON MYOWN BEHALF I AM SPEAKING WITH THE CONCURRENCE AND AT THE EXPRESSREQUEST OF NO FEWER THAN EIGHT OF MY FELLOWTOWNSMEN WHO AREIMMEDIATELY AROUND US
 IT IS OUR UNITED SENTIMENT THAT MR
 BULSTRODESHOULD BE CALLED UPONAND I DO NOW CALL UPON HIMTO RESIGN PUBLICPOSITIONS WHICH HE HOLDS NOT SIMPLY AS A TAXPAYER BUT AS A GENTLEMANAMONG GENTLEMEN
 THERE ARE PRACTICES AND THERE ARE ACTS WHICH OWING TOCIRCUMSTANCES THE LAW CANNOT VISIT THOUGH THEY MAY BE WORSE THAN MANYTHINGS WHICH ARE LEGALLY PUNISHABLE
 HONEST MEN AND GENTLEMEN IF THEYDONT WANT THE COMPANY OF PEOPLE WHO PERPETRATE SUCH ACTS HAVE GOT TODEFEND THEMSELVES AS THEY BEST CAN AND THAT IS WHAT I AND THE FRIENDSWHOM I MAY CALL MY CLIENTS IN THIS AFFAIR ARE DETERMINED TO DO
 I DONTSAY THAT MR
 BULSTRODE HAS BEEN GUILTY OF SHAMEFUL ACTS BUT I CALLUPON HIM EITHER PUBLICLY TO DENY AND CONFUTE THE SCANDALOUS STATEMENTSMADE AGAINST HIM BY A MAN NOW DEAD AND WHO DIED IN HIS HOUSETHESTATEMENT THAT HE WAS FOR MANY YEARS ENGAGED IN NEFARIOUS PRACTICESAND THAT HE WON HIS FORTUNE BY DISHONEST PROCEDURESOR ELSE TO WITHDRAWFROM POSITIONS WHICH COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN ALLOWED HIM AS A GENTLEMANAMONG GENTLEMEN
ALL EYES IN THE ROOM WERE TURNED ON MR
 BULSTRODE WHO SINCE THE FIRSTMENTION OF HIS NAME HAD BEEN GOING THROUGH A CRISIS OF FEELING ALMOSTTOO VIOLENT FOR HIS DELICATE FRAME TO SUPPORT
 LYDGATE WHO HIMSELF WASUNDERGOING A SHOCK AS FROM THE TERRIBLE PRACTICAL INTERPRETATION OFSOME FAINT AUGURY FELT NEVERTHELESS THAT HIS OWN MOVEMENT OFRESENTFUL HATRED WAS CHECKED BY THAT INSTINCT OF THE HEALER WHICHTHINKS FIRST OF BRINGING RESCUE OR RELIEF TO THE SUFFERER WHEN HELOOKED AT THE SHRUNKEN MISERY OF BULSTRODES LIVID FACE
THE QUICK VISION THAT HIS LIFE WAS AFTER ALL A FAILURE THAT HE WAS ADISHONORED MAN AND MUST QUAIL BEFORE THE GLANCE OF THOSE TOWARDS WHOMHE HAD HABITUALLY ASSUMED THE ATTITUDE OF A REPROVERTHAT GOD HADDISOWNED HIM BEFORE MEN AND LEFT HIM UNSCREENED TO THE TRIUMPHANT SCORNOF THOSE WHO WERE GLAD TO HAVE THEIR HATRED JUSTIFIEDTHE SENSE OFUTTER FUTILITY IN THAT EQUIVOCATION WITH HIS CONSCIENCE IN DEALING WITHTHE LIFE OF HIS ACCOMPLICE AN EQUIVOCATION WHICH NOW TURNED VENOMOUSLYUPON HIM WITH THE FULLGROWN FANG OF A DISCOVERED LIEALL THIS RUSHEDTHROUGH HIM LIKE THE AGONY OF TERROR WHICH FAILS TO KILL AND LEAVESTHE EARS STILL OPEN TO THE RETURNING WAVE OF EXECRATION
 THE SUDDENSENSE OF EXPOSURE AFTER THE REESTABLISHED SENSE OF SAFETY CAMENOT TOTHE COARSE ORGANIZATION OF A CRIMINAL BUT TO THE SUSCEPTIBLE NERVE OFA MAN WHOSE INTENSEST BEING LAY IN SUCH MASTERY AND PREDOMINANCE AS THECONDITIONS OF HIS LIFE HAD SHAPED FOR HIM
BUT IN THAT INTENSE BEING LAY THE STRENGTH OF REACTION
 THROUGH ALL HISBODILY INFIRMITY THERE RAN A TENACIOUS NERVE OF AMBITIOUSSELFPRESERVING WILL WHICH HAD CONTINUALLY LEAPED OUT LIKE A FLAMESCATTERING ALL DOCTRINAL FEARS AND WHICH EVEN WHILE HE SAT AN OBJECTOF COMPASSION FOR THE MERCIFUL WAS BEGINNING TO STIR AND GLOW UNDERHIS ASHY PALENESS
 BEFORE THE LAST WORDS WERE OUT OF MR
 HAWLEYSMOUTH BULSTRODE FELT THAT HE SHOULD ANSWER AND THAT HIS ANSWER WOULDBE A RETORT
 HE DARED NOT GET UP AND SAY I AM NOT GUILTY THE WHOLESTORY IS FALSEEVEN IF HE HAD DARED THIS IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO HIMUNDER HIS PRESENT KEEN SENSE OF BETRAYAL AS VAIN AS TO PULL FORCOVERING TO HIS NAKEDNESS A FRAIL RAG WHICH WOULD REND AT EVERY LITTLESTRAIN
FOR A FEW MOMENTS THERE WAS TOTAL SILENCE WHILE EVERY MAN IN THE ROOMWAS LOOKING AT BULSTRODE
 HE SAT PERFECTLY STILL LEANING HARD AGAINSTTHE BACK OF HIS CHAIR HE COULD NOT VENTURE TO RISE AND WHEN HE BEGANTO SPEAK HE PRESSED HIS HANDS UPON THE SEAT ON EACH SIDE OF HIM
 BUTHIS VOICE WAS PERFECTLY AUDIBLE THOUGH HOARSER THAN USUAL AND HISWORDS WERE DISTINCTLY PRONOUNCED THOUGH HE PAUSED BETWEEN SENTENCE ASIF SHORT OF BREATH
 HE SAID TURNING FIRST TOWARD MR
 THESIGER ANDTHEN LOOKING AT MR
 HAWLEYI PROTEST BEFORE YOU SIR AS A CHRISTIAN MINISTER AGAINST THESANCTION OF PROCEEDINGS TOWARDS ME WHICH ARE DICTATED BY VIRULENTHATRED
 THOSE WHO ARE HOSTILE TO ME ARE GLAD TO BELIEVE ANY LIBELUTTERED BY A LOOSE TONGUE AGAINST ME
 AND THEIR CONSCIENCES BECOMESTRICT AGAINST ME
 SAY THAT THE EVILSPEAKING OF WHICH I AM TO BE MADETHE VICTIM ACCUSES ME OF MALPRACTICES HERE BULSTRODES VOICE ROSE ANDTOOK ON A MORE BITING ACCENT TILL IT SEEMED A LOW CRYWHO SHALL BE MYACCUSER
 NOT MEN WHOSE OWN LIVES ARE UNCHRISTIAN NAY SCANDALOUSNOTMEN WHO THEMSELVES USE LOW INSTRUMENTS TO CARRY OUT THEIR ENDSWHOSEPROFESSION IS A TISSUE OF CHICANERYWHO HAVE BEEN SPENDING THEIR INCOMEON THEIR OWN SENSUAL ENJOYMENTS WHILE I HAVE BEEN DEVOTING MINE TOADVANCE THE BEST OBJECTS WITH REGARD TO THIS LIFE AND THE NEXT
AFTER THE WORD CHICANERY THERE WAS A GROWING NOISE HALF OF MURMURS ANDHALF OF HISSES WHILE FOUR PERSONS STARTED UP AT ONCEMR
 HAWLEY MR
TOLLER MR
 CHICHELY AND MR
 HACKBUTT BUT MR
 HAWLEYS OUTBURST WASINSTANTANEOUS AND LEFT THE OTHERS BEHIND IN SILENCE
IF YOU MEAN ME SIR I CALL YOU AND EVERY ONE ELSE TO THE INSPECTIONOF MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE
 AS TO CHRISTIAN OR UNCHRISTIAN I REPUDIATEYOUR CANTING PALAVERING CHRISTIANITY AND AS TO THE WAY IN WHICH ISPEND MY INCOME IT IS NOT MY PRINCIPLE TO MAINTAIN THIEVES AND CHEATOFFSPRING OF THEIR DUE INHERITANCE IN ORDER TO SUPPORT RELIGION AND SETMYSELF UP AS A SAINTLY KILLJOY
 I AFFECT NO NICENESS OF CONSCIENCEIHAVE NOT FOUND ANY NICE STANDARDS NECESSARY YET TO MEASURE YOUR ACTIONSBY SIR
 AND I AGAIN CALL UPON YOU TO ENTER INTO SATISFACTORYEXPLANATIONS CONCERNING THE SCANDALS AGAINST YOU OR ELSE TO WITHDRAWFROM POSTS IN WHICH WE AT ANY RATE DECLINE YOU AS A COLLEAGUE
 I SAYSIR WE DECLINE TO COOPERATE WITH A MAN WHOSE CHARACTER IS NOT CLEAREDFROM INFAMOUS LIGHTS CAST UPON IT NOT ONLY BY REPORTS BUT BY RECENTACTIONS
ALLOW ME MR
 HAWLEY SAID THE CHAIRMAN AND MR
 HAWLEY STILLFUMING BOWED HALF IMPATIENTLY AND SAT DOWN WITH HIS HANDS THRUST DEEPIN HIS POCKETS
MR
 BULSTRODE IT IS NOT DESIRABLE I THINK TO PROLONG THE PRESENTDISCUSSION SAID MR
 THESIGER TURNING TO THE PALLID TREMBLING MAN IMUST SO FAR CONCUR WITH WHAT HAS FALLEN FROM MR
 HAWLEY IN EXPRESSIONOF A GENERAL FEELING AS TO THINK IT DUE TO YOUR CHRISTIAN PROFESSIONTHAT YOU SHOULD CLEAR YOURSELF IF POSSIBLE FROM UNHAPPY ASPERSIONS
 IFOR MY PART SHOULD BE WILLING TO GIVE YOU FULL OPPORTUNITY AND HEARING
BUT I MUST SAY THAT YOUR PRESENT ATTITUDE IS PAINFULLY INCONSISTENTWITH THOSE PRINCIPLES WHICH YOU HAVE SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF WITHAND FOR THE HONOR OF WHICH I AM BOUND TO CARE
 I RECOMMEND YOU ATPRESENT AS YOUR CLERGYMAN AND ONE WHO HOPES FOR YOUR REINSTATEMENT INRESPECT TO QUIT THE ROOM AND AVOID FURTHER HINDRANCE TO BUSINESS
BULSTRODE AFTER A MOMENTS HESITATION TOOK HIS HAT FROM THE FLOOR ANDSLOWLY ROSE BUT HE GRASPED THE CORNER OF THE CHAIR SO TOTTERINGLY THATLYDGATE FELT SURE THERE WAS NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH IN HIM TO WALK AWAYWITHOUT SUPPORT
 WHAT COULD HE DO
 HE COULD NOT SEE A MAN SINK CLOSE TOHIM FOR WANT OF HELP
 HE ROSE AND GAVE HIS ARM TO BULSTRODE AND INTHAT WAY LED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM YET THIS ACT WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEENONE OF GENTLE DUTY AND PURE COMPASSION WAS AT THIS MOMENT UNSPEAKABLYBITTER TO HIM
 IT SEEMED AS IF HE WERE PUTTING HIS SIGNMANUAL TO THATASSOCIATION OF HIMSELF WITH BULSTRODE OF WHICH HE NOW SAW THE FULLMEANING AS IT MUST HAVE PRESENTED ITSELF TO OTHER MINDS
 HE NOW FELTTHE CONVICTION THAT THIS MAN WHO WAS LEANING TREMBLINGLY ON HIS ARMHAD GIVEN HIM THE THOUSAND POUNDS AS A BRIBE AND THAT SOMEHOW THETREATMENT OF RAFFLES HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH FROM AN EVIL MOTIVE
 THEINFERENCES WERE CLOSELY LINKED ENOUGH THE TOWN KNEW OF THE LOANBELIEVED IT TO BE A BRIBE AND BELIEVED THAT HE TOOK IT AS A BRIBE
POOR LYDGATE HIS MIND STRUGGLING UNDER THE TERRIBLE CLUTCH OF THISREVELATION WAS ALL THE WHILE MORALLY FORCED TO TAKE MR
 BULSTRODE TOTHE BANK SEND A MAN OFF FOR HIS CARRIAGE AND WAIT TO ACCOMPANY HIMHOME
MEANWHILE THE BUSINESS OF THE MEETING WAS DESPATCHED AND FRINGED OFFINTO EAGER DISCUSSION AMONG VARIOUS GROUPS CONCERNING THIS AFFAIR OFBULSTRODEAND LYDGATE
MR
 BROOKE WHO HAD BEFORE HEARD ONLY IMPERFECT HINTS OF IT AND WASVERY UNEASY THAT HE HAD GONE A LITTLE TOO FAR IN COUNTENANCINGBULSTRODE NOW GOT HIMSELF FULLY INFORMED AND FELT SOME BENEVOLENTSADNESS IN TALKING TO MR
 FAREBROTHER ABOUT THE UGLY LIGHT IN WHICHLYDGATE HAD COME TO BE REGARDED
 MR
 FAREBROTHER WAS GOING TO WALK BACKTO LOWICK
STEP INTO MY CARRIAGE SAID MR
 BROOKE
 I AM GOING ROUND TO SEE MRS
CASAUBON
 SHE WAS TO COME BACK FROM YORKSHIRE LAST NIGHT
 SHE WILL LIKETO SEE ME YOU KNOW
SO THEY DROVE ALONG MR
 BROOKE CHATTING WITH GOODNATURED HOPE THATTHERE HAD NOT REALLY BEEN ANYTHING BLACK IN LYDGATES BEHAVIORA YOUNGFELLOW WHOM HE HAD SEEN TO BE QUITE ABOVE THE COMMON MARK WHEN HEBROUGHT A LETTER FROM HIS UNCLE SIR GODWIN
 MR
 FAREBROTHER SAIDLITTLE HE WAS DEEPLY MOURNFUL WITH A KEEN PERCEPTION OF HUMANWEAKNESS HE COULD NOT BE CONFIDENT THAT UNDER THE PRESSURE OFHUMILIATING NEEDS LYDGATE HAD NOT FALLEN BELOW HIMSELF
WHEN THE CARRIAGE DROVE UP TO THE GATE OF THE MANOR DOROTHEA WAS OUTON THE GRAVEL AND CAME TO GREET THEM
WELL MY DEAR SAID MR
 BROOKE WE HAVE JUST COME FROM A MEETINGASANITARY MEETING YOU KNOW
WAS MR
 LYDGATE THERE
 SAID DOROTHEA WHO LOOKED FULL OF HEALTH ANDANIMATION AND STOOD WITH HER HEAD BARE UNDER THE GLEAMING APRILLIGHTS
 I WANT TO SEE HIM AND HAVE A GREAT CONSULTATION WITH HIM ABOUTTHE HOSPITAL
 I HAVE ENGAGED WITH MR
 BULSTRODE TO DO SO
OH MY DEAR SAID MR
 BROOKE WE HAVE BEEN HEARING BAD NEWSBADNEWS YOU KNOW
THEY WALKED THROUGH THE GARDEN TOWARDS THE CHURCHYARD GATE MR
FAREBROTHER WANTING TO GO ON TO THE PARSONAGE AND DOROTHEA HEARD THEWHOLE SAD STORY
SHE LISTENED WITH DEEP INTEREST AND BEGGED TO HEAR TWICE OVER THEFACTS AND IMPRESSIONS CONCERNING LYDGATE
 AFTER A SHORT SILENCEPAUSING AT THE CHURCHYARD GATE AND ADDRESSING MR
 FAREBROTHER SHESAID ENERGETICALLYYOU DONT BELIEVE THAT MR
 LYDGATE IS GUILTY OF ANYTHING BASE
 I WILLNOT BELIEVE IT
 LET US FIND OUT THE TRUTH AND CLEAR HIM
BOOK VIII
SUNSET AND SUNRISE
CHAPTER LXXII
FULL SOULS ARE DOUBLE MIRRORS MAKING STILLAN ENDLESS VISTA OF FAIR THINGS BEFOREREPEATING THINGS BEHIND
DOROTHEAS IMPETUOUS GENEROSITY WHICH WOULD HAVE LEAPED AT ONCE TO THEVINDICATION OF LYDGATE FROM THE SUSPICION OF HAVING ACCEPTED MONEY AS ABRIBE UNDERWENT A MELANCHOLY CHECK WHEN SHE CAME TO CONSIDER ALL THECIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE BY THE LIGHT OF MR
 FAREBROTHERS EXPERIENCE
IT IS A DELICATE MATTER TO TOUCH HE SAID
 HOW CAN WE BEGIN TOINQUIRE INTO IT
 IT MUST BE EITHER PUBLICLY BY SETTING THE MAGISTRATEAND CORONER TO WORK OR PRIVATELY BY QUESTIONING LYDGATE
 AS TO THEFIRST PROCEEDING THERE IS NO SOLID GROUND TO GO UPON ELSE HAWLEY WOULDHAVE ADOPTED IT AND AS TO OPENING THE SUBJECT WITH LYDGATE I CONFESSI SHOULD SHRINK FROM IT
 HE WOULD PROBABLY TAKE IT AS A DEADLY INSULT
I HAVE MORE THAN ONCE EXPERIENCED THE DIFFICULTY OF SPEAKING TO HIM ONPERSONAL MATTERS
 ANDONE SHOULD KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS CONDUCTBEFOREHAND TO FEEL VERY CONFIDENT OF A GOOD RESULT
I FEEL CONVINCED THAT HIS CONDUCT HAS NOT BEEN GUILTY I BELIEVE THATPEOPLE ARE ALMOST ALWAYS BETTER THAN THEIR NEIGHBORS THINK THEY ARESAID DOROTHEA
 SOME OF HER INTENSEST EXPERIENCE IN THE LAST TWO YEARSHAD SET HER MIND STRONGLY IN OPPOSITION TO ANY UNFAVORABLE CONSTRUCTIONOF OTHERS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE FELT RATHER DISCONTENTED WITH MR
FAREBROTHER
 SHE DISLIKED THIS CAUTIOUS WEIGHING OF CONSEQUENCESINSTEAD OF AN ARDENT FAITH IN EFFORTS OF JUSTICE AND MERCY WHICH WOULDCONQUER BY THEIR EMOTIONAL FORCE
 TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS HE WAS DINING ATTHE MANOR WITH HER UNCLE AND THE CHETTAMS AND WHEN THE DESSERT WASSTANDING UNEATEN THE SERVANTS WERE OUT OF THE ROOM AND MR
 BROOKE WASNODDING IN A NAP SHE RETURNED TO THE SUBJECT WITH RENEWED VIVACITY
MR
 LYDGATE WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IF HIS FRIENDS HEAR A CALUMNY ABOUTHIM THEIR FIRST WISH MUST BE TO JUSTIFY HIM
 WHAT DO WE LIVE FOR IF ITIS NOT TO MAKE LIFE LESS DIFFICULT TO EACH OTHER
 I CANNOT BEINDIFFERENT TO THE TROUBLES OF A MAN WHO ADVISED ME IN MY TROUBLEAND ATTENDED ME IN MY ILLNESS
DOROTHEAS TONE AND MANNER WERE NOT MORE ENERGETIC THAN THEY HAD BEENWHEN SHE WAS AT THE HEAD OF HER UNCLES TABLE NEARLY THREE YEARSBEFORE AND HER EXPERIENCE SINCE HAD GIVEN HER MORE RIGHT TO EXPRESS ADECIDED OPINION
 BUT SIR JAMES CHETTAM WAS NO LONGER THE DIFFIDENT ANDACQUIESCENT SUITOR HE WAS THE ANXIOUS BROTHERINLAW WITH A DEVOUTADMIRATION FOR HIS SISTER BUT WITH A CONSTANT ALARM LEST SHE SHOULDFALL UNDER SOME NEW ILLUSION ALMOST AS BAD AS MARRYING CASAUBON
 HESMILED MUCH LESS WHEN HE SAID EXACTLY IT WAS MORE OFTEN ANINTRODUCTION TO A DISSENTIENT OPINION THAN IN THOSE SUBMISSIVE BACHELORDAYS AND DOROTHEA FOUND TO HER SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD TO RESOLVE NOT TOBE AFRAID OF HIMALL THE MORE BECAUSE HE WAS REALLY HER BEST FRIEND
 HEDISAGREED WITH HER NOW
BUT DOROTHEA HE SAID REMONSTRANTLY YOU CANT UNDERTAKE TO MANAGEA MANS LIFE FOR HIM IN THAT WAY
 LYDGATE MUST KNOWAT LEAST HE WILLSOON COME TO KNOW HOW HE STANDS
 IF HE CAN CLEAR HIMSELF HE WILL
 HEMUST ACT FOR HIMSELF
I THINK HIS FRIENDS MUST WAIT TILL THEY FIND AN OPPORTUNITY ADDEDMR
 FAREBROTHER
 IT IS POSSIBLEI HAVE OFTEN FELT SO MUCH WEAKNESS INMYSELF THAT I CAN CONCEIVE EVEN A MAN OF HONORABLE DISPOSITION SUCH ASI HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED LYDGATE TO BE SUCCUMBING TO SUCH A TEMPTATIONAS THAT OF ACCEPTING MONEY WHICH WAS OFFERED MORE OR LESS INDIRECTLY ASA BRIBE TO INSURE HIS SILENCE ABOUT SCANDALOUS FACTS LONG GONE BY
 ISAY I CAN CONCEIVE THIS IF HE WERE UNDER THE PRESSURE OF HARDCIRCUMSTANCESIF HE HAD BEEN HARASSED AS I FEEL SURE LYDGATE HAS BEEN
I WOULD NOT BELIEVE ANYTHING WORSE OF HIM EXCEPT UNDER STRINGENT PROOF
BUT THERE IS THE TERRIBLE NEMESIS FOLLOWING ON SOME ERRORS THAT IT ISALWAYS POSSIBLE FOR THOSE WHO LIKE IT TO INTERPRET THEM INTO A CRIMETHERE IS NO PROOF IN FAVOR OF THE MAN OUTSIDE HIS OWN CONSCIOUSNESS ANDASSERTION
OH HOW CRUEL
 SAID DOROTHEA CLASPING HER HANDS
 AND WOULD YOU NOTLIKE TO BE THE ONE PERSON WHO BELIEVED IN THAT MANS INNOCENCE IF THEREST OF THE WORLD BELIED HIM
 BESIDES THERE IS A MANS CHARACTERBEFOREHAND TO SPEAK FOR HIM
BUT MY DEAR MRS
 CASAUBON SAID MR
 FAREBROTHER SMILING GENTLY ATHER ARDOR CHARACTER IS NOT CUT IN MARBLEIT IS NOT SOMETHING SOLIDAND UNALTERABLE
 IT IS SOMETHING LIVING AND CHANGING AND MAY BECOMEDISEASED AS OUR BODIES DO
THEN IT MAY BE RESCUED AND HEALED SAID DOROTHEA I SHOULD NOT BEAFRAID OF ASKING MR
 LYDGATE TO TELL ME THE TRUTH THAT I MIGHT HELPHIM
 WHY SHOULD I BE AFRAID
 NOW THAT I AM NOT TO HAVE THE LAND JAMESI MIGHT DO AS MR
 BULSTRODE PROPOSED AND TAKE HIS PLACE IN PROVIDINGFOR THE HOSPITAL AND I HAVE TO CONSULT MR
 LYDGATE TO KNOW THOROUGHLYWHAT ARE THE PROSPECTS OF DOING GOOD BY KEEPING UP THE PRESENT PLANS
THERE IS THE BEST OPPORTUNITY IN THE WORLD FOR ME TO ASK FOR HISCONFIDENCE AND HE WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL ME THINGS WHICH MIGHT MAKE ALLTHE CIRCUMSTANCES CLEAR
 THEN WE WOULD ALL STAND BY HIM AND BRING HIMOUT OF HIS TROUBLE
 PEOPLE GLORIFY ALL SORTS OF BRAVERY EXCEPT THEBRAVERY THEY MIGHT SHOW ON BEHALF OF THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBORS
DOROTHEAS EYES HAD A MOIST BRIGHTNESS IN THEM AND THE CHANGED TONESOF HER VOICE ROUSED HER UNCLE WHO BEGAN TO LISTEN
IT IS TRUE THAT A WOMAN MAY VENTURE ON SOME EFFORTS OF SYMPATHY WHICHWOULD HARDLY SUCCEED IF WE MEN UNDERTOOK THEM SAID MR
 FAREBROTHERALMOST CONVERTED BY DOROTHEAS ARDOR
SURELY A WOMAN IS BOUND TO BE CAUTIOUS AND LISTEN TO THOSE WHO KNOWTHE WORLD BETTER THAN SHE DOES
 SAID SIR JAMES WITH HIS LITTLE FROWN
WHATEVER YOU DO IN THE END DOROTHEA YOU SHOULD REALLY KEEP BACK ATPRESENT AND NOT VOLUNTEER ANY MEDDLING WITH THIS BULSTRODE BUSINESS
WE DONT KNOW YET WHAT MAY TURN UP
 YOU MUST AGREE WITH ME
 HE ENDEDLOOKING AT MR
 FAREBROTHER
I DO THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO WAIT SAID THE LATTER
YES YES MY DEAR SAID MR
 BROOKE NOT QUITE KNOWING AT WHAT POINTTHE DISCUSSION HAD ARRIVED BUT COMING UP TO IT WITH A CONTRIBUTIONWHICH WAS GENERALLY APPROPRIATE
 IT IS EASY TO GO TOO FAR YOU KNOW
YOU MUST NOT LET YOUR IDEAS RUN AWAY WITH YOU
 AND AS TO BEING IN AHURRY TO PUT MONEY INTO SCHEMESIT WONT DO YOU KNOW
 GARTH HAS DRAWNME IN UNCOMMONLY WITH REPAIRS DRAINING THAT SORT OF THING IMUNCOMMONLY OUT OF POCKET WITH ONE THING OR ANOTHER
 I MUST PULL UP
 ASFOR YOU CHETTAM YOU ARE SPENDING A FORTUNE ON THOSE OAK FENCES ROUNDYOUR DEMESNE
DOROTHEA SUBMITTING UNEASILY TO THIS DISCOURAGEMENT WENT WITH CELIAINTO THE LIBRARY WHICH WAS HER USUAL DRAWINGROOM
NOW DODO DO LISTEN TO WHAT JAMES SAYS SAID CELIA ELSE YOU WILLBE GETTING INTO A SCRAPE
 YOU ALWAYS DID AND YOU ALWAYS WILL WHEN YOUSET ABOUT DOING AS YOU PLEASE
 AND I THINK IT IS A MERCY NOW AFTER ALLTHAT YOU HAVE GOT JAMES TO THINK FOR YOU
 HE LETS YOU HAVE YOUR PLANSONLY HE HINDERS YOU FROM BEING TAKEN IN
 AND THAT IS THE GOOD OF HAVINGA BROTHER INSTEAD OF A HUSBAND
 A HUSBAND WOULD NOT LET YOU HAVE YOURPLANS
AS IF I WANTED A HUSBAND
 SAID DOROTHEA
 I ONLY WANT NOT TO HAVE MYFEELINGS CHECKED AT EVERY TURN
 MRS
 CASAUBON WAS STILL UNDISCIPLINEDENOUGH TO BURST INTO ANGRY TEARS
NOW REALLY DODO SAID CELIA WITH RATHER A DEEPER GUTTURAL THANUSUAL YOU ARE CONTRADICTORY FIRST ONE THING AND THEN ANOTHER
 YOUUSED TO SUBMIT TO MR
 CASAUBON QUITE SHAMEFULLY I THINK YOU WOULD HAVEGIVEN UP EVER COMING TO SEE ME IF HE HAD ASKED YOU
OF COURSE I SUBMITTED TO HIM BECAUSE IT WAS MY DUTY IT WAS MYFEELING FOR HIM SAID DOROTHEA LOOKING THROUGH THE PRISM OF HERTEARS
THEN WHY CANT YOU THINK IT YOUR DUTY TO SUBMIT A LITTLE TO WHAT JAMESWISHES
 SAID CELIA WITH A SENSE OF STRINGENCY IN HER ARGUMENT
BECAUSE HE ONLY WISHES WHAT IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD
 AND OF COURSE MENKNOW BEST ABOUT EVERYTHING EXCEPT WHAT WOMEN KNOW BETTER
 DOROTHEALAUGHED AND FORGOT HER TEARS
WELL I MEAN ABOUT BABIES AND THOSE THINGS EXPLAINED CELIA
 ISHOULD NOT GIVE UP TO JAMES WHEN I KNEW HE WAS WRONG AS YOU USED TO DOTO MR
 CASAUBON
CHAPTER LXXIII
PITY THE LADEN ONE THIS WANDERING WOEMAY VISIT YOU AND ME
WHEN LYDGATE HAD ALLAYED MRS
 BULSTRODES ANXIETY BY TELLING HER THATHER HUSBAND HAD BEEN SEIZED WITH FAINTNESS AT THE MEETING BUT THAT HETRUSTED SOON TO SEE HIM BETTER AND WOULD CALL AGAIN THE NEXT DAYUNLESS SHE SENT FOR HIM EARLIER HE WENT DIRECTLY HOME GOT ON HISHORSE AND RODE THREE MILES OUT OF THE TOWN FOR THE SAKE OF BEING OUTOF REACH
HE FELT HIMSELF BECOMING VIOLENT AND UNREASONABLE AS IF RAGING UNDERTHE PAIN OF STINGS HE WAS READY TO CURSE THE DAY ON WHICH HE HAD COMETO MIDDLEMARCH
 EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM THERE SEEMED A MEREPREPARATION FOR THIS HATEFUL FATALITY WHICH HAD COME AS A BLIGHT ONHIS HONORABLE AMBITION AND MUST MAKE EVEN PEOPLE WHO HAD ONLY VULGARSTANDARDS REGARD HIS REPUTATION AS IRREVOCABLY DAMAGED
 IN SUCH MOMENTSA MAN CAN HARDLY ESCAPE BEING UNLOVING
 LYDGATE THOUGHT OF HIMSELF ASTHE SUFFERER AND OF OTHERS AS THE AGENTS WHO HAD INJURED HIS LOT
 HEHAD MEANT EVERYTHING TO TURN OUT DIFFERENTLY AND OTHERS HAD THRUSTTHEMSELVES INTO HIS LIFE AND THWARTED HIS PURPOSES
 HIS MARRIAGE SEEMEDAN UNMITIGATED CALAMITY AND HE WAS AFRAID OF GOING TO ROSAMOND BEFOREHE HAD VENTED HIMSELF IN THIS SOLITARY RAGE LEST THE MERE SIGHT OF HERSHOULD EXASPERATE HIM AND MAKE HIM BEHAVE UNWARRANTABLY
 THERE AREEPISODES IN MOST MENS LIVES IN WHICH THEIR HIGHEST QUALITIES CAN ONLYCAST A DETERRING SHADOW OVER THE OBJECTS THAT FILL THEIR INWARD VISIONLYDGATES TENDERHEARTEDNESS WAS PRESENT JUST THEN ONLY AS A DREAD LESTHE SHOULD OFFEND AGAINST IT NOT AS AN EMOTION THAT SWAYED HIM TOTENDERNESS
 FOR HE WAS VERY MISERABLE
 ONLY THOSE WHO KNOW THESUPREMACY OF THE INTELLECTUAL LIFETHE LIFE WHICH HAS A SEED OFENNOBLING THOUGHT AND PURPOSE WITHIN ITCAN UNDERSTAND THE GRIEF OF ONEWHO FALLS FROM THAT SERENE ACTIVITY INTO THE ABSORBING SOULWASTINGSTRUGGLE WITH WORLDLY ANNOYANCES
HOW WAS HE TO LIVE ON WITHOUT VINDICATING HIMSELF AMONG PEOPLE WHOSUSPECTED HIM OF BASENESS
 HOW COULD HE GO SILENTLY AWAY FROMMIDDLEMARCH AS IF HE WERE RETREATING BEFORE A JUST CONDEMNATION
 ANDYET HOW WAS HE TO SET ABOUT VINDICATING HIMSELF
FOR THAT SCENE AT THE MEETING WHICH HE HAD JUST WITNESSED ALTHOUGH ITHAD TOLD HIM NO PARTICULARS HAD BEEN ENOUGH TO MAKE HIS OWN SITUATIONTHOROUGHLY CLEAR TO HIM
 BULSTRODE HAD BEEN IN DREAD OF SCANDALOUSDISCLOSURES ON THE PART OF RAFFLES
 LYDGATE COULD NOW CONSTRUCT ALL THEPROBABILITIES OF THE CASE
 HE WAS AFRAID OF SOME BETRAYAL IN MYHEARING ALL HE WANTED WAS TO BIND ME TO HIM BY A STRONG OBLIGATIONTHAT WAS WHY HE PASSED ON A SUDDEN FROM HARDNESS TO LIBERALITY
 AND HEMAY HAVE TAMPERED WITH THE PATIENTHE MAY HAVE DISOBEYED MY ORDERS
 IFEAR HE DID
 BUT WHETHER HE DID OR NOT THE WORLD BELIEVES THAT HESOMEHOW OR OTHER POISONED THE MAN AND THAT I WINKED AT THE CRIME IF IDIDNT HELP IN IT
 AND YETAND YET HE MAY NOT BE GUILTY OF THE LASTOFFENCE AND IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT THE CHANGE TOWARDS ME MAY HAVEBEEN A GENUINE RELENTINGTHE EFFECT OF SECOND THOUGHTS SUCH AS HEALLEGED
 WHAT WE CALL THE JUST POSSIBLE IS SOMETIMES TRUE AND THETHING WE FIND IT EASIER TO BELIEVE IS GROSSLY FALSE
 IN HIS LASTDEALINGS WITH THIS MAN BULSTRODE MAY HAVE KEPT HIS HANDS PURE IN SPITEOF MY SUSPICION TO THE CONTRARY
THERE WAS A BENUMBING CRUELTY IN HIS POSITION
 EVEN IF HE RENOUNCEDEVERY OTHER CONSIDERATION THAN THAT OF JUSTIFYING HIMSELFIF HE METSHRUGS COLD GLANCES AND AVOIDANCE AS AN ACCUSATION AND MADE A PUBLICSTATEMENT OF ALL THE FACTS AS HE KNEW THEM WHO WOULD BE CONVINCED
 ITWOULD BE PLAYING THE PART OF A FOOL TO OFFER HIS OWN TESTIMONY ONBEHALF OF HIMSELF AND SAY I DID NOT TAKE THE MONEY AS A BRIBE
 THECIRCUMSTANCES WOULD ALWAYS BE STRONGER THAN HIS ASSERTION
 AND BESIDESTO COME FORWARD AND TELL EVERYTHING ABOUT HIMSELF MUST INCLUDEDECLARATIONS ABOUT BULSTRODE WHICH WOULD DARKEN THE SUSPICIONS OFOTHERS AGAINST HIM
 HE MUST TELL THAT HE HAD NOT KNOWN OF RAFFLESSEXISTENCE WHEN HE FIRST MENTIONED HIS PRESSING NEED OF MONEY TOBULSTRODE AND THAT HE TOOK THE MONEY INNOCENTLY AS A RESULT OF THATCOMMUNICATION NOT KNOWING THAT A NEW MOTIVE FOR THE LOAN MIGHT HAVEARISEN ON HIS BEING CALLED IN TO THIS MAN
 AND AFTER ALL THE SUSPICIONOF BULSTRODES MOTIVES MIGHT BE UNJUST
BUT THEN CAME THE QUESTION WHETHER HE SHOULD HAVE ACTED IN PRECISELYTHE SAME WAY IF HE HAD NOT TAKEN THE MONEY
 CERTAINLY IF RAFFLES HADCONTINUED ALIVE AND SUSCEPTIBLE OF FURTHER TREATMENT WHEN HE ARRIVEDAND HE HAD THEN IMAGINED ANY DISOBEDIENCE TO HIS ORDERS ON THE PART OFBULSTRODE HE WOULD HAVE MADE A STRICT INQUIRY AND IF HIS CONJECTUREHAD BEEN VERIFIED HE WOULD HAVE THROWN UP THE CASE IN SPITE OF HISRECENT HEAVY OBLIGATION
 BUT IF HE HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY MONEYIFBULSTRODE HAD NEVER REVOKED HIS COLD RECOMMENDATION OF BANKRUPTCYWOULDHE LYDGATE HAVE ABSTAINED FROM ALL INQUIRY EVEN ON FINDING THE MANDEAD
WOULD THE SHRINKING FROM AN INSULT TO BULSTRODEWOULD THEDUBIOUSNESS OF ALL MEDICAL TREATMENT AND THE ARGUMENT THAT HIS OWNTREATMENT WOULD PASS FOR THE WRONG WITH MOST MEMBERS OF HISPROFESSIONHAVE HAD JUST THE SAME FORCE OR SIGNIFICANCE WITH HIM
THAT WAS THE UNEASY CORNER OF LYDGATES CONSCIOUSNESS WHILE HE WASREVIEWING THE FACTS AND RESISTING ALL REPROACH
 IF HE HAD BEENINDEPENDENT THIS MATTER OF A PATIENTS TREATMENT AND THE DISTINCT RULETHAT HE MUST DO OR SEE DONE THAT WHICH HE BELIEVED BEST FOR THE LIFECOMMITTED TO HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN THE POINT ON WHICH HE WOULD HAVE BEENTHE STURDIEST
 AS IT WAS HE HAD RESTED IN THE CONSIDERATION THATDISOBEDIENCE TO HIS ORDERS HOWEVER IT MIGHT HAVE ARISEN COULD NOT BECONSIDERED A CRIME THAT IN THE DOMINANT OPINION OBEDIENCE TO HISORDERS WAS JUST AS LIKELY TO BE FATAL AND THAT THE AFFAIR WAS SIMPLYONE OF ETIQUETTE
 WHEREAS AGAIN AND AGAIN IN HIS TIME OF FREEDOM HEHAD DENOUNCED THE PERVERSION OF PATHOLOGICAL DOUBT INTO MORAL DOUBT ANDHAD SAIDTHE PUREST EXPERIMENT IN TREATMENT MAY STILL BECONSCIENTIOUS MY BUSINESS IS TO TAKE CARE OF LIFE AND TO DO THE BESTI CAN THINK OF FOR IT
 SCIENCE IS PROPERLY MORE SCRUPULOUS THAN DOGMA
DOGMA GIVES A CHARTER TO MISTAKE BUT THE VERY BREATH OF SCIENCE IS ACONTEST WITH MISTAKE AND MUST KEEP THE CONSCIENCE ALIVE
 ALAS
 THESCIENTIFIC CONSCIENCE HAD GOT INTO THE DEBASING COMPANY OF MONEYOBLIGATION AND SELFISH RESPECTS
IS THERE A MEDICAL MAN OF THEM ALL IN MIDDLEMARCH WHO WOULD QUESTIONHIMSELF AS I DO
 SAID POOR LYDGATE WITH A RENEWED OUTBURST OFREBELLION AGAINST THE OPPRESSION OF HIS LOT
 AND YET THEY WILL ALLFEEL WARRANTED IN MAKING A WIDE SPACE BETWEEN ME AND THEM AS IF I WEREA LEPER
 MY PRACTICE AND MY REPUTATION ARE UTTERLY DAMNEDI CAN SEETHAT
 EVEN IF I COULD BE CLEARED BY VALID EVIDENCE IT WOULD MAKELITTLE DIFFERENCE TO THE BLESSED WORLD HERE
 I HAVE BEEN SET DOWN ASTAINTED AND SHOULD BE CHEAPENED TO THEM ALL THE SAME
ALREADY THERE HAD BEEN ABUNDANT SIGNS WHICH HAD HITHERTO PUZZLED HIMTHAT JUST WHEN HE HAD BEEN PAYING OFF HIS DEBTS AND GETTING CHEERFULLYON HIS FEET THE TOWNSMEN WERE AVOIDING HIM OR LOOKING STRANGELY ATHIM AND IN TWO INSTANCES IT CAME TO HIS KNOWLEDGE THAT PATIENTS OF HISHAD CALLED IN ANOTHER PRACTITIONER
 THE REASONS WERE TOO PLAIN NOW
 THEGENERAL BLACKBALLING HAD BEGUN
NO WONDER THAT IN LYDGATES ENERGETIC NATURE THE SENSE OF A HOPELESSMISCONSTRUCTION EASILY TURNED INTO A DOGGED RESISTANCE
 THE SCOWL WHICHOCCASIONALLY SHOWED ITSELF ON HIS SQUARE BROW WAS NOT A MEANINGLESSACCIDENT
 ALREADY WHEN HE WAS REENTERING THE TOWN AFTER THAT RIDETAKEN IN THE FIRST HOURS OF STINGING PAIN HE WAS SETTING HIS MIND ONREMAINING IN MIDDLEMARCH IN SPITE OF THE WORST THAT COULD BE DONEAGAINST HIM
 HE WOULD NOT RETREAT BEFORE CALUMNY AS IF HE SUBMITTED TOIT
 HE WOULD FACE IT TO THE UTMOST AND NO ACT OF HIS SHOULD SHOW THATHE WAS AFRAID
 IT BELONGED TO THE GENEROSITY AS WELL AS DEFIANT FORCEOF HIS NATURE THAT HE RESOLVED NOT TO SHRINK FROM SHOWING TO THE FULLHIS SENSE OF OBLIGATION TO BULSTRODE
 IT WAS TRUE THAT THE ASSOCIATIONWITH THIS MAN HAD BEEN FATAL TO HIMTRUE THAT IF HE HAD HAD THETHOUSAND POUNDS STILL IN HIS HANDS WITH ALL HIS DEBTS UNPAID HE WOULDHAVE RETURNED THE MONEY TO BULSTRODE AND TAKEN BEGGARY RATHER THAN THERESCUE WHICH HAD BEEN SULLIED WITH THE SUSPICION OF A BRIBE FORREMEMBER HE WAS ONE OF THE PROUDEST AMONG THE SONS OFMENNEVERTHELESS HE WOULD NOT TURN AWAY FROM THIS CRUSHEDFELLOWMORTAL WHOSE AID HE HAD USED AND MAKE A PITIFUL EFFORT TO GETACQUITTAL FOR HIMSELF BY HOWLING AGAINST ANOTHER
 I SHALL DO AS ITHINK RIGHT AND EXPLAIN TO NOBODY
 THEY WILL TRY TO STARVE ME OUTBUT HE WAS GOING ON WITH AN OBSTINATE RESOLVE BUT HE WAS GETTINGNEAR HOME AND THE THOUGHT OF ROSAMOND URGED ITSELF AGAIN INTO THATCHIEF PLACE FROM WHICH IT HAD BEEN THRUST BY THE AGONIZED STRUGGLES OFWOUNDED HONOR AND PRIDE
HOW WOULD ROSAMOND TAKE IT ALL
 HERE WAS ANOTHER WEIGHT OF CHAIN TODRAG AND POOR LYDGATE WAS IN A BAD MOOD FOR BEARING HER DUMB MASTERY
HE HAD NO IMPULSE TO TELL HER THE TROUBLE WHICH MUST SOON BE COMMON TOTHEM BOTH
 HE PREFERRED WAITING FOR THE INCIDENTAL DISCLOSURE WHICHEVENTS MUST SOON BRING ABOUT
CHAPTER LXXIV
MERCIFULLY GRANT THAT WE MAY GROW AGED TOGETHER
BOOK OF TOBIT MARRIAGE PRAYER
IN MIDDLEMARCH A WIFE COULD NOT LONG REMAIN IGNORANT THAT THE TOWN HELDA BAD OPINION OF HER HUSBAND
 NO FEMININE INTIMATE MIGHT CARRY HERFRIENDSHIP SO FAR AS TO MAKE A PLAIN STATEMENT TO THE WIFE OF THEUNPLEASANT FACT KNOWN OR BELIEVED ABOUT HER HUSBAND BUT WHEN A WOMANWITH HER THOUGHTS MUCH AT LEISURE GOT THEM SUDDENLY EMPLOYED ONSOMETHING GRIEVOUSLY DISADVANTAGEOUS TO HER NEIGHBORS VARIOUS MORALIMPULSES WERE CALLED INTO PLAY WHICH TENDED TO STIMULATE UTTERANCE
CANDOR WAS ONE
 TO BE CANDID IN MIDDLEMARCH PHRASEOLOGY MEANT TO USEAN EARLY OPPORTUNITY OF LETTING YOUR FRIENDS KNOW THAT YOU DID NOT TAKEA CHEERFUL VIEW OF THEIR CAPACITY THEIR CONDUCT OR THEIR POSITIONAND A ROBUST CANDOR NEVER WAITED TO BE ASKED FOR ITS OPINION
 THENAGAIN THERE WAS THE LOVE OF TRUTHA WIDE PHRASE BUT MEANING IN THISRELATION A LIVELY OBJECTION TO SEEING A WIFE LOOK HAPPIER THAN HERHUSBANDS CHARACTER WARRANTED OR MANIFEST TOO MUCH SATISFACTION IN HERLOTTHE POOR THING SHOULD HAVE SOME HINT GIVEN HER THAT IF SHE KNEW THETRUTH SHE WOULD HAVE LESS COMPLACENCY IN HER BONNET AND IN LIGHTDISHES FOR A SUPPERPARTY
 STRONGER THAN ALL THERE WAS THE REGARD FORA FRIENDS MORAL IMPROVEMENT SOMETIMES CALLED HER SOUL WHICH WASLIKELY TO BE BENEFITED BY REMARKS TENDING TO GLOOM UTTERED WITH THEACCOMPANIMENT OF PENSIVE STARING AT THE FURNITURE AND A MANNER IMPLYINGTHAT THE SPEAKER WOULD NOT TELL WHAT WAS ON HER MIND FROM REGARD TOTHE FEELINGS OF HER HEARER
 ON THE WHOLE ONE MIGHT SAY THAT AN ARDENTCHARITY WAS AT WORK SETTING THE VIRTUOUS MIND TO MAKE A NEIGHBORUNHAPPY FOR HER GOOD
THERE WERE HARDLY ANY WIVES IN MIDDLEMARCH WHOSE MATRIMONIALMISFORTUNES WOULD IN DIFFERENT WAYS BE LIKELY TO CALL FORTH MORE OFTHIS MORAL ACTIVITY THAN ROSAMOND AND HER AUNT BULSTRODE
 MRS
BULSTRODE WAS NOT AN OBJECT OF DISLIKE AND HAD NEVER CONSCIOUSLYINJURED ANY HUMAN BEING
 MEN HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT HER A HANDSOMECOMFORTABLE WOMAN AND HAD RECKONED IT AMONG THE SIGNS OF BULSTRODESHYPOCRISY THAT HE HAD CHOSEN A REDBLOODED VINCY INSTEAD OF A GHASTLYAND MELANCHOLY PERSON SUITED TO HIS LOW ESTEEM FOR EARTHLY PLEASURE
WHEN THE SCANDAL ABOUT HER HUSBAND WAS DISCLOSED THEY REMARKED OFHERAH POOR WOMAN
 SHES AS HONEST AS THE DAYSHE NEVER SUSPECTEDANYTHING WRONG IN HIM YOU MAY DEPEND ON IT
 WOMEN WHO WERE INTIMATEWITH HER TALKED TOGETHER MUCH OF POOR HARRIET IMAGINED WHAT HERFEELINGS MUST BE WHEN SHE CAME TO KNOW EVERYTHING AND CONJECTURED HOWMUCH SHE HAD ALREADY COME TO KNOW
 THERE WAS NO SPITEFUL DISPOSITIONTOWARDS HER RATHER THERE WAS A BUSY BENEVOLENCE ANXIOUS TO ASCERTAINWHAT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR HER TO FEEL AND DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCESWHICH OF COURSE KEPT THE IMAGINATION OCCUPIED WITH HER CHARACTER ANDHISTORY FROM THE TIMES WHEN SHE WAS HARRIET VINCY TILL NOW
 WITH THEREVIEW OF MRS
 BULSTRODE AND HER POSITION IT WAS INEVITABLE TOASSOCIATE ROSAMOND WHOSE PROSPECTS WERE UNDER THE SAME BLIGHT WITH HERAUNTS
 ROSAMOND WAS MORE SEVERELY CRITICISED AND LESS PITIED THOUGHSHE TOO AS ONE OF THE GOOD OLD VINCY FAMILY WHO HAD ALWAYS BEEN KNOWNIN MIDDLEMARCH WAS REGARDED AS A VICTIM TO MARRIAGE WITH ANINTERLOPER
 THE VINCYS HAD THEIR WEAKNESSES BUT THEN THEY LAY ON THESURFACE THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING BAD TO BE FOUND OUT CONCERNINGTHEM
 MRS
 BULSTRODE WAS VINDICATED FROM ANY RESEMBLANCE TO HERHUSBAND
 HARRIETS FAULTS WERE HER OWN
SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SHOWY SAID MRS
 HACKBUTT MAKING TEA FOR A SMALLPARTY THOUGH SHE HAS GOT INTO THE WAY OF PUTTING HER RELIGIONFORWARD TO CONFORM TO HER HUSBAND SHE HAS TRIED TO HOLD HER HEAD UPABOVE MIDDLEMARCH BY MAKING IT KNOWN THAT SHE INVITES CLERGYMEN ANDHEAVENKNOWSWHO FROM RIVERSTON AND THOSE PLACES
WE CAN HARDLY BLAME HER FOR THAT SAID MRS
 SPRAGUE BECAUSE FEW OFTHE BEST PEOPLE IN THE TOWN CARED TO ASSOCIATE WITH BULSTRODE AND SHEMUST HAVE SOMEBODY TO SIT DOWN AT HER TABLE
MR
 THESIGER HAS ALWAYS COUNTENANCED HIM SAID MRS
 HACKBUTT
 ITHINK HE MUST BE SORRY NOW
BUT HE WAS NEVER FOND OF HIM IN HIS HEARTTHAT EVERY ONE KNOWS SAIDMRS
 TOM TOLLER
 MR
 THESIGER NEVER GOES INTO EXTREMES
 HE KEEPS TOTHE TRUTH IN WHAT IS EVANGELICAL
 IT IS ONLY CLERGYMEN LIKE MR
 TYKEWHO WANT TO USE DISSENTING HYMNBOOKS AND THAT LOW KIND OF RELIGIONWHO EVER FOUND BULSTRODE TO THEIR TASTE
I UNDERSTAND MR
 TYKE IS IN GREAT DISTRESS ABOUT HIM SAID MRS
HACKBUTT
 AND WELL HE MAY BE THEY SAY THE BULSTRODES HAVE HALF KEPTTHE TYKE FAMILY
AND OF COURSE IT IS A DISCREDIT TO HIS DOCTRINES SAID MRS
 SPRAGUEWHO WAS ELDERLY AND OLDFASHIONED IN HER OPINIONS
PEOPLE WILL NOT MAKE A BOAST OF BEING METHODISTICAL IN MIDDLEMARCH FORA GOOD WHILE TO COME
I THINK WE MUST NOT SET DOWN PEOPLES BAD ACTIONS TO THEIR RELIGIONSAID FALCONFACED MRS
 PLYMDALE WHO HAD BEEN LISTENING HITHERTO
OH MY DEAR WE ARE FORGETTING SAID MRS
 SPRAGUE
 WE OUGHT NOT TOBE TALKING OF THIS BEFORE YOU
I AM SURE I HAVE NO REASON TO BE PARTIAL SAID MRS
 PLYMDALECOLORING
 ITS TRUE MR
 PLYMDALE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON GOOD TERMS WITHMR
 BULSTRODE AND HARRIET VINCY WAS MY FRIEND LONG BEFORE SHE MARRIEDHIM
 BUT I HAVE ALWAYS KEPT MY OWN OPINIONS AND TOLD HER WHERE SHE WASWRONG POOR THING
 STILL IN POINT OF RELIGION I MUST SAY MR
BULSTRODE MIGHT HAVE DONE WHAT HE HAS AND WORSE AND YET HAVE BEEN AMAN OF NO RELIGION
 I DONT SAY THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A LITTLE TOOMUCH OF THATI LIKE MODERATION MYSELF
 BUT TRUTH IS TRUTH
 THE MENTRIED AT THE ASSIZES ARE NOT ALL OVERRELIGIOUS I SUPPOSE
WELL SAID MRS
 HACKBUTT WHEELING ADROITLY ALL I CAN SAY IS THATI THINK SHE OUGHT TO SEPARATE FROM HIM
I CANT SAY THAT SAID MRS
 SPRAGUE
 SHE TOOK HIM FOR BETTER ORWORSE YOU KNOW
BUT WORSE CAN NEVER MEAN FINDING OUT THAT YOUR HUSBAND IS FIT FORNEWGATE SAID MRS
 HACKBUTT
 FANCY LIVING WITH SUCH A MAN
 I SHOULDEXPECT TO BE POISONED
YES I THINK MYSELF IT IS AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO CRIME IF SUCH MEN ARE TOBE TAKEN CARE OF AND WAITED ON BY GOOD WIVES SAID MRS
 TOM TOLLER
AND A GOOD WIFE POOR HARRIET HAS BEEN SAID MRS
 PLYMDALE
 SHETHINKS HER HUSBAND THE FIRST OF MEN
 ITS TRUE HE HAS NEVER DENIED HERANYTHING
WELL WE SHALL SEE WHAT SHE WILL DO SAID MRS
 HACKBUTT
 I SUPPOSESHE KNOWS NOTHING YET POOR CREATURE
 I DO HOPE AND TRUST I SHALL NOTSEE HER FOR I SHOULD BE FRIGHTENED TO DEATH LEST I SHOULD SAY ANYTHINGABOUT HER HUSBAND
 DO YOU THINK ANY HINT HAS REACHED HER
I SHOULD HARDLY THINK SO SAID MRS
 TOM TOLLER
 WE HEAR THAT HE ISILL AND HAS NEVER STIRRED OUT OF THE HOUSE SINCE THE MEETING ONTHURSDAY BUT SHE WAS WITH HER GIRLS AT CHURCH YESTERDAY AND THEY HADNEW TUSCAN BONNETS
 HER OWN HAD A FEATHER IN IT
 I HAVE NEVER SEEN THATHER RELIGION MADE ANY DIFFERENCE IN HER DRESS
SHE WEARS VERY NEAT PATTERNS ALWAYS SAID MRS
 PLYMDALE A LITTLESTUNG
 AND THAT FEATHER I KNOW SHE GOT DYED A PALE LAVENDER ON PURPOSETO BE CONSISTENT
 I MUST SAY IT OF HARRIET THAT SHE WISHES TO DORIGHT
AS TO HER KNOWING WHAT HAS HAPPENED IT CANT BE KEPT FROM HER LONGSAID MRS
 HACKBUTT
 THE VINCYS KNOW FOR MR
 VINCY WAS AT THE MEETING
IT WILL BE A GREAT BLOW TO HIM
 THERE IS HIS DAUGHTER AS WELL AS HISSISTER
YES INDEED SAID MRS
 SPRAGUE
 NOBODY SUPPOSES THAT MR
 LYDGATE CANGO ON HOLDING UP HIS HEAD IN MIDDLEMARCH THINGS LOOK SO BLACK ABOUTTHE THOUSAND POUNDS HE TOOK JUST AT THAT MANS DEATH
 IT REALLY MAKESONE SHUDDER
PRIDE MUST HAVE A FALL SAID MRS
 HACKBUTT
I AM NOT SO SORRY FOR ROSAMOND VINCY THAT WAS AS I AM FOR HER AUNTSAID MRS
 PLYMDALE
 SHE NEEDED A LESSON
I SUPPOSE THE BULSTRODES WILL GO AND LIVE ABROAD SOMEWHERE SAID MRS
SPRAGUE
 THAT IS WHAT IS GENERALLY DONE WHEN THERE IS ANYTHINGDISGRACEFUL IN A FAMILY
AND A MOST DEADLY BLOW IT WILL BE TO HARRIET SAID MRS
 PLYMDALE
 IFEVER A WOMAN WAS CRUSHED SHE WILL BE
 I PITY HER FROM MY HEART
 ANDWITH ALL HER FAULTS FEW WOMEN ARE BETTER
 FROM A GIRL SHE HAD THENEATEST WAYS AND WAS ALWAYS GOODHEARTED AND AS OPEN AS THE DAY
 YOUMIGHT LOOK INTO HER DRAWERS WHEN YOU WOULDALWAYS THE SAME
 AND SO SHEHAS BROUGHT UP KATE AND ELLEN
 YOU MAY THINK HOW HARD IT WILL BE FORHER TO GO AMONG FOREIGNERS
THE DOCTOR SAYS THAT IS WHAT HE SHOULD RECOMMEND THE LYDGATES TO DOSAID MRS
 SPRAGUE
 HE SAYS LYDGATE OUGHT TO HAVE KEPT AMONG THEFRENCH
THAT WOULD SUIT HER WELL ENOUGH I DARE SAY SAID MRS
 PLYMDALETHERE IS THAT KIND OF LIGHTNESS ABOUT HER
 BUT SHE GOT THAT FROM HERMOTHER SHE NEVER GOT IT FROM HER AUNT BULSTRODE WHO ALWAYS GAVE HERGOOD ADVICE AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE WOULD RATHER HAVE HAD HER MARRYELSEWHERE
MRS
 PLYMDALE WAS IN A SITUATION WHICH CAUSED HER SOME COMPLICATION OFFEELING
 THERE HAD BEEN NOT ONLY HER INTIMACY WITH MRS
 BULSTRODE BUTALSO A PROFITABLE BUSINESS RELATION OF THE GREAT PLYMDALE DYEING HOUSEWITH MR
 BULSTRODE WHICH ON THE ONE HAND WOULD HAVE INCLINED HER TODESIRE THAT THE MILDEST VIEW OF HIS CHARACTER SHOULD BE THE TRUE ONEBUT ON THE OTHER MADE HER THE MORE AFRAID OF SEEMING TO PALLIATE HISCULPABILITY
 AGAIN THE LATE ALLIANCE OF HER FAMILY WITH THE TOLLERSHAD BROUGHT HER IN CONNECTION WITH THE BEST CIRCLE WHICH GRATIFIED HERIN EVERY DIRECTION EXCEPT IN THE INCLINATION TO THOSE SERIOUS VIEWSWHICH SHE BELIEVED TO BE THE BEST IN ANOTHER SENSE
 THE SHARP LITTLEWOMANS CONSCIENCE WAS SOMEWHAT TROUBLED IN THE ADJUSTMENT OF THESEOPPOSING BESTS AND OF HER GRIEFS AND SATISFACTIONS UNDER LATEEVENTS WHICH WERE LIKELY TO HUMBLE THOSE WHO NEEDED HUMBLING BUT ALSOTO FALL HEAVILY ON HER OLD FRIEND WHOSE FAULTS SHE WOULD HAVE PREFERREDSEEING ON A BACKGROUND OF PROSPERITY
POOR MRS
 BULSTRODE MEANWHILE HAD BEEN NO FURTHER SHAKEN BY THEONCOMING TREAD OF CALAMITY THAN IN THE BUSIER STIRRING OF THAT SECRETUNEASINESS WHICH HAD ALWAYS BEEN PRESENT IN HER SINCE THE LAST VISIT OFRAFFLES TO THE SHRUBS
 THAT THE HATEFUL MAN HAD COME ILL TO STONECOURT AND THAT HER HUSBAND HAD CHOSEN TO REMAIN THERE AND WATCH OVERHIM SHE ALLOWED TO BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT RAFFLES HAD BEENEMPLOYED AND AIDED IN EARLIERDAYS AND THAT THIS MADE A TIE OFBENEVOLENCE TOWARDS HIM IN HIS DEGRADED HELPLESSNESS AND SHE HAD BEENSINCE THEN INNOCENTLY CHEERED BY HER HUSBANDS MORE HOPEFUL SPEECHABOUT HIS OWN HEALTH AND ABILITY TO CONTINUE HIS ATTENTION TO BUSINESS
THE CALM WAS DISTURBED WHEN LYDGATE HAD BROUGHT HIM HOME ILL FROM THEMEETING AND IN SPITE OF COMFORTING ASSURANCES DURING THE NEXT FEWDAYS SHE CRIED IN PRIVATE FROM THE CONVICTION THAT HER HUSBAND WAS NOTSUFFERING FROM BODILY ILLNESS MERELY BUT FROM SOMETHING THAT AFFLICTEDHIS MIND
 HE WOULD NOT ALLOW HER TO READ TO HIM AND SCARCELY TO SITWITH HIM ALLEGING NERVOUS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SOUNDS AND MOVEMENTS YETSHE SUSPECTED THAT IN SHUTTING HIMSELF UP IN HIS PRIVATE ROOM HE WANTEDTO BE BUSY WITH HIS PAPERS
 SOMETHING SHE FELT SURE HAD HAPPENED
PERHAPS IT WAS SOME GREAT LOSS OF MONEY AND SHE WAS KEPT IN THE DARK
NOT DARING TO QUESTION HER HUSBAND SHE SAID TO LYDGATE ON THE FIFTHDAY AFTER THE MEETING WHEN SHE HAD NOT LEFT HOME EXCEPT TO GO TOCHURCHMR
 LYDGATE PRAY BE OPEN WITH ME I LIKE TO KNOW THE TRUTH
 HASANYTHING HAPPENED TO MR
 BULSTRODE
SOME LITTLE NERVOUS SHOCK SAID LYDGATE EVASIVELY
 HE FELT THAT ITWAS NOT FOR HIM TO MAKE THE PAINFUL REVELATION
BUT WHAT BROUGHT IT ON
 SAID MRS
 BULSTRODE LOOKING DIRECTLY AT HIMWITH HER LARGE DARK EYES
THERE IS OFTEN SOMETHING POISONOUS IN THE AIR OF PUBLIC ROOMS SAIDLYDGATE
 STRONG MEN CAN STAND IT BUT IT TELLS ON PEOPLE IN PROPORTIONTO THE DELICACY OF THEIR SYSTEMS
 IT IS OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCOUNT FORTHE PRECISE MOMENT OF AN ATTACKOR RATHER TO SAY WHY THE STRENGTHGIVES WAY AT A PARTICULAR MOMENT
MRS
 BULSTRODE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS ANSWER
 THERE REMAINED INHER THE BELIEF THAT SOME CALAMITY HAD BEFALLEN HER HUSBAND OF WHICHSHE WAS TO BE KEPT IN IGNORANCE AND IT WAS IN HER NATURE STRONGLY TOOBJECT TO SUCH CONCEALMENT
 SHE BEGGED LEAVE FOR HER DAUGHTERS TO SITWITH THEIR FATHER AND DROVE INTO THE TOWN TO PAY SOME VISITSCONJECTURING THAT IF ANYTHING WERE KNOWN TO HAVE GONE WRONG IN MR
BULSTRODES AFFAIRS SHE SHOULD SEE OR HEAR SOME SIGN OF IT
SHE CALLED ON MRS
 THESIGER WHO WAS NOT AT HOME AND THEN DROVE TOMRS
 HACKBUTTS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHURCHYARD
 MRS
 HACKBUTT SAWHER COMING FROM AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW AND REMEMBERING HER FORMER ALARMLEST SHE SHOULD MEET MRS
 BULSTRODE FELT ALMOST BOUND IN CONSISTENCYTO SEND WORD THAT SHE WAS NOT AT HOME BUT AGAINST THAT THERE WAS ASUDDEN STRONG DESIRE WITHIN HER FOR THE EXCITEMENT OF AN INTERVIEW INWHICH SHE WAS QUITE DETERMINED NOT TO MAKE THE SLIGHTEST ALLUSION TOWHAT WAS IN HER MIND
HENCE MRS
 BULSTRODE WAS SHOWN INTO THE DRAWINGROOM AND MRS
 HACKBUTTWENT TO HER WITH MORE TIGHTNESS OF LIP AND RUBBING OF HER HANDS THANWAS USUALLY OBSERVABLE IN HER THESE BEING PRECAUTIONS ADOPTED AGAINSTFREEDOM OF SPEECH
 SHE WAS RESOLVED NOT TO ASK HOW MR
 BULSTRODE WAS
I HAVE NOT BEEN ANYWHERE EXCEPT TO CHURCH FOR NEARLY A WEEK SAIDMRS
 BULSTRODE AFTER A FEW INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
 BUT MR
 BULSTRODEWAS TAKEN SO ILL AT THE MEETING ON THURSDAY THAT I HAVE NOT LIKED TOLEAVE THE HOUSE
MRS
 HACKBUTT RUBBED THE BACK OF ONE HAND WITH THE PALM OF THE OTHERHELD AGAINST HER CHEST AND LET HER EYES RAMBLE OVER THE PATTERN ON THERUG
WAS MR
 HACKBUTT AT THE MEETING
 PERSEVERED MRS
 BULSTRODE
YES HE WAS SAID MRS
 HACKBUTT WITH THE SAME ATTITUDE
 THE LAND ISTO BE BOUGHT BY SUBSCRIPTION I BELIEVE
LET US HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE NO MORE CASES OF CHOLERA TO BE BURIEDIN IT SAID MRS
 BULSTRODE
 IT IS AN AWFUL VISITATION
 BUT I ALWAYSTHINK MIDDLEMARCH A VERY HEALTHY SPOT
 I SUPPOSE IT IS BEING USED TO ITFROM A CHILD BUT I NEVER SAW THE TOWN I SHOULD LIKE TO LIVE AT BETTERAND ESPECIALLY OUR END
I AM SURE I SHOULD BE GLAD THAT YOU ALWAYS SHOULD LIVE AT MIDDLEMARCHMRS
 BULSTRODE SAID MRS
 HACKBUTT WITH A SLIGHT SIGH
 STILL WEMUST LEARN TO RESIGN OURSELVES WHEREVER OUR LOT MAY BE CAST
 THOUGH IAM SURE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN WHO WILL WISH YOUWELL
MRS
 HACKBUTT LONGED TO SAY IF YOU TAKE MY ADVICE YOU WILL PART FROMYOUR HUSBAND BUT IT SEEMED CLEAR TO HER THAT THE POOR WOMAN KNEWNOTHING OF THE THUNDER READY TO BOLT ON HER HEAD AND SHE HERSELF COULDDO NO MORE THAN PREPARE HER A LITTLE
 MRS
 BULSTRODE FELT SUDDENLYRATHER CHILL AND TREMBLING THERE WAS EVIDENTLY SOMETHING UNUSUALBEHIND THIS SPEECH OF MRS
 HACKBUTTS BUT THOUGH SHE HAD SET OUT WITHTHE DESIRE TO BE FULLY INFORMED SHE FOUND HERSELF UNABLE NOW TO PURSUEHER BRAVE PURPOSE AND TURNING THE CONVERSATION BY AN INQUIRY ABOUT THEYOUNG HACKBUTTS SHE SOON TOOK HER LEAVE SAYING THAT SHE WAS GOING TOSEE MRS
 PLYMDALE
 ON HER WAY THITHER SHE TRIED TO IMAGINE THAT THEREMIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME UNUSUALLY WARM SPARRING AT THE MEETING BETWEEN MR
BULSTRODE AND SOME OF HIS FREQUENT OPPONENTSPERHAPS MR
 HACKBUTT MIGHTHAVE BEEN ONE OF THEM
 THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR EVERYTHING
BUT WHEN SHE WAS IN CONVERSATION WITH MRS
 PLYMDALE THAT COMFORTINGEXPLANATION SEEMED NO LONGER TENABLE
 SELINA RECEIVED HER WITH APATHETIC AFFECTIONATENESS AND A DISPOSITION TO GIVE EDIFYING ANSWERS ONTHE COMMONEST TOPICS WHICH COULD HARDLY HAVE REFERENCE TO AN ORDINARYQUARREL OF WHICH THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCE WAS A PERTURBATION OFMR
 BULSTRODES HEALTH
 BEFOREHAND MRS
 BULSTRODE HAD THOUGHT THAT SHEWOULD SOONER QUESTION MRS
 PLYMDALE THAN ANY ONE ELSE BUT SHE FOUND TOHER SURPRISE THAT AN OLD FRIEND IS NOT ALWAYS THE PERSON WHOM IT ISEASIEST TO MAKE A CONFIDANT OF THERE WAS THE BARRIER OF REMEMBEREDCOMMUNICATION UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCESTHERE WAS THE DISLIKE OF BEINGPITIED AND INFORMED BY ONE WHO HAD BEEN LONG WONT TO ALLOW HER THESUPERIORITY
 FOR CERTAIN WORDS OF MYSTERIOUS APPROPRIATENESS THAT MRS
PLYMDALE LET FALL ABOUT HER RESOLUTION NEVER TO TURN HER BACK ON HERFRIENDS CONVINCED MRS
 BULSTRODE THAT WHAT HAD HAPPENED MUST BE SOMEKIND OF MISFORTUNE AND INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO SAY WITH HER NATIVEDIRECTNESS WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR MIND
 SHE FOUND HERSELFANXIOUS TO GET AWAY BEFORE SHE HAD HEARD ANYTHING MORE EXPLICIT
 SHEBEGAN TO HAVE AN AGITATING CERTAINTY THAT THE MISFORTUNE WAS SOMETHINGMORE THAN THE MERE LOSS OF MONEY BEING KEENLY SENSITIVE TO THE FACTTHAT SELINA NOW JUST AS MRS
 HACKBUTT HAD DONE BEFORE AVOIDEDNOTICING WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT HER HUSBAND AS THEY WOULD HAVE AVOIDEDNOTICING A PERSONAL BLEMISH
SHE SAID GOODBY WITH NERVOUS HASTE AND TOLD THE COACHMAN TO DRIVE TOMR
 VINCYS WAREHOUSE
 IN THAT SHORT DRIVE HER DREAD GATHERED SO MUCHFORCE FROM THE SENSE OF DARKNESS THAT WHEN SHE ENTERED THE PRIVATECOUNTINGHOUSE WHERE HER BROTHER SAT AT HIS DESK HER KNEES TREMBLEDAND HER USUALLY FLORID FACE WAS DEATHLY PALE
 SOMETHING OF THE SAMEEFFECT WAS PRODUCED IN HIM BY THE SIGHT OF HER HE ROSE FROM HIS SEATTO MEET HER TOOK HER BY THE HAND AND SAID WITH HIS IMPULSIVERASHNESSGOD HELP YOU HARRIET
 YOU KNOW ALL
THAT MOMENT WAS PERHAPS WORSE THAN ANY WHICH CAME AFTER
 IT CONTAINEDTHAT CONCENTRATED EXPERIENCE WHICH IN GREAT CRISES OF EMOTION REVEALSTHE BIAS OF A NATURE AND IS PROPHETIC OF THE ULTIMATE ACT WHICH WILLEND AN INTERMEDIATE STRUGGLE
 WITHOUT THAT MEMORY OF RAFFLES SHE MIGHTSTILL HAVE THOUGHT ONLY OF MONETARY RUIN BUT NOW ALONG WITH HERBROTHERS LOOK AND WORDS THERE DARTED INTO HER MIND THE IDEA OF SOMEGUILT IN HER HUSBANDTHEN UNDER THE WORKING OF TERROR CAME THE IMAGEOF HER HUSBAND EXPOSED TO DISGRACEAND THEN AFTER AN INSTANT OFSCORCHING SHAME IN WHICH SHE FELT ONLY THE EYES OF THE WORLD WITH ONELEAP OF HER HEART SHE WAS AT HIS SIDE IN MOURNFUL BUT UNREPROACHINGFELLOWSHIP WITH SHAME AND ISOLATION
 ALL THIS WENT ON WITHIN HER IN AMERE FLASH OF TIMEWHILE SHE SANK INTO THE CHAIR AND RAISED HER EYESTO HER BROTHER WHO STOOD OVER HER
 I KNOW NOTHING WALTER
 WHAT ISIT
 SHE SAID FAINTLY
HE TOLD HER EVERYTHING VERY INARTIFICIALLY IN SLOW FRAGMENTS MAKINGHER AWARE THAT THE SCANDAL WENT MUCH BEYOND PROOF ESPECIALLY AS TO THEEND OF RAFFLES
PEOPLE WILL TALK HE SAID
 EVEN IF A MAN HAS BEEN ACQUITTED BY AJURY THEYLL TALK AND NOD AND WINKAND AS FAR AS THE WORLD GOES AMAN MIGHT OFTEN AS WELL BE GUILTY AS NOT
 ITS A BREAKDOWN BLOW AND ITDAMAGES LYDGATE AS MUCH AS BULSTRODE
 I DONT PRETEND TO SAY WHAT ISTHE TRUTH
 I ONLY WISH WE HAD NEVER HEARD THE NAME OF EITHER BULSTRODEOR LYDGATE
 YOUD BETTER HAVE BEEN A VINCY ALL YOUR LIFE AND SO HADROSAMOND
 MRS
 BULSTRODE MADE NO REPLY
BUT YOU MUST BEAR UP AS WELL AS YOU CAN HARRIET
 PEOPLE DONT BLAMEYOU
 AND ILL STAND BY YOU WHATEVER YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO DOSAID THE BROTHER WITH ROUGH BUT WELLMEANING AFFECTIONATENESS
GIVE ME YOUR ARM TO THE CARRIAGE WALTER SAID MRS
 BULSTRODE
 IFEEL VERY WEAK
AND WHEN SHE GOT HOME SHE WAS OBLIGED TO SAY TO HER DAUGHTER I AM NOTWELL MY DEAR I MUST GO AND LIE DOWN
 ATTEND TO YOUR PAPA
 LEAVE ME INQUIET
 I SHALL TAKE NO DINNER
SHE LOCKED HERSELF IN HER ROOM
 SHE NEEDED TIME TO GET USED TO HERMAIMED CONSCIOUSNESS HER POOR LOPPED LIFE BEFORE SHE COULD WALKSTEADILY TO THE PLACE ALLOTTED HER
 A NEW SEARCHING LIGHT HAD FALLEN ONHER HUSBANDS CHARACTER AND SHE COULD NOT JUDGE HIM LENIENTLY THETWENTY YEARS IN WHICH SHE HAD BELIEVED IN HIM AND VENERATED HIM BYVIRTUE OF HIS CONCEALMENTS CAME BACK WITH PARTICULARS THAT MADE THEMSEEM AN ODIOUS DECEIT
 HE HAD MARRIED HER WITH THAT BAD PAST LIFEHIDDEN BEHIND HIM AND SHE HAD NO FAITH LEFT TO PROTEST HIS INNOCENCEOF THE WORST THAT WAS IMPUTED TO HIM
 HER HONEST OSTENTATIOUS NATUREMADE THE SHARING OF A MERITED DISHONOR AS BITTER AS IT COULD BE TO ANYMORTAL
BUT THIS IMPERFECTLY TAUGHT WOMAN WHOSE PHRASES AND HABITS WERE AN ODDPATCHWORK HAD A LOYAL SPIRIT WITHIN HER
 THE MAN WHOSE PROSPERITY SHEHAD SHARED THROUGH NEARLY HALF A LIFE AND WHO HAD UNVARYINGLYCHERISHED HERNOW THAT PUNISHMENT HAD BEFALLEN HIM IT WAS NOT POSSIBLETO HER IN ANY SENSE TO FORSAKE HIM
 THERE IS A FORSAKING WHICH STILLSITS AT THE SAME BOARD AND LIES ON THE SAME COUCH WITH THE FORSAKENSOUL WITHERING IT THE MORE BY UNLOVING PROXIMITY
 SHE KNEW WHEN SHELOCKED HER DOOR THAT SHE SHOULD UNLOCK IT READY TO GO DOWN TO HERUNHAPPY HUSBAND AND ESPOUSE HIS SORROW AND SAY OF HIS GUILT I WILLMOURN AND NOT REPROACH
 BUT SHE NEEDED TIME TO GATHER UP HER STRENGTHSHE NEEDED TO SOB OUT HER FAREWELL TO ALL THE GLADNESS AND PRIDE OF HERLIFE
 WHEN SHE HAD RESOLVED TO GO DOWN SHE PREPARED HERSELF BY SOMELITTLE ACTS WHICH MIGHT SEEM MERE FOLLY TO A HARD ONLOOKER THEY WEREHER WAY OF EXPRESSING TO ALL SPECTATORS VISIBLE OR INVISIBLE THAT SHEHAD BEGUN A NEW LIFE IN WHICH SHE EMBRACED HUMILIATION
 SHE TOOK OFFALL HER ORNAMENTS AND PUT ON A PLAIN BLACK GOWN AND INSTEAD OF WEARINGHER MUCHADORNED CAP AND LARGE BOWS OF HAIR SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR DOWNAND PUT ON A PLAIN BONNETCAP WHICH MADE HER LOOK SUDDENLY LIKE ANEARLY METHODIST
BULSTRODE WHO KNEW THAT HIS WIFE HAD BEEN OUT AND HAD COME IN SAYINGTHAT SHE WAS NOT WELL HAD SPENT THE TIME IN AN AGITATION EQUAL TOHERS
 HE HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO HER LEARNING THE TRUTH FROM OTHERS ANDHAD ACQUIESCED IN THAT PROBABILITY AS SOMETHING EASIER TO HIM THAN ANYCONFESSION
 BUT NOW THAT HE IMAGINED THE MOMENT OF HER KNOWLEDGE COMEHE AWAITED THE RESULT IN ANGUISH
 HIS DAUGHTERS HAD BEEN OBLIGED TOCONSENT TO LEAVE HIM AND THOUGH HE HAD ALLOWED SOME FOOD TO BE BROUGHTTO HIM HE HAD NOT TOUCHED IT
 HE FELT HIMSELF PERISHING SLOWLY INUNPITIED MISERY
 PERHAPS HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIS WIFES FACE WITHAFFECTION IN IT AGAIN
 AND IF HE TURNED TO GOD THERE SEEMED TO BE NOANSWER BUT THE PRESSURE OF RETRIBUTION
IT WAS EIGHT OCLOCK IN THE EVENING BEFORE THE DOOR OPENED AND HIS WIFEENTERED
 HE DARED NOT LOOK UP AT HER
 HE SAT WITH HIS EYES BENT DOWNAND AS SHE WENT TOWARDS HIM SHE THOUGHT HE LOOKED SMALLERHE SEEMED SOWITHERED AND SHRUNKEN
 A MOVEMENT OF NEW COMPASSION AND OLD TENDERNESSWENT THROUGH HER LIKE A GREAT WAVE AND PUTTING ONE HAND ON HIS WHICHRESTED ON THE ARM OF THE CHAIR AND THE OTHER ON HIS SHOULDER SHESAID SOLEMNLY BUT KINDLYLOOK UP NICHOLAS
HE RAISED HIS EYES WITH A LITTLE START AND LOOKED AT HER HALF AMAZEDFOR A MOMENT HER PALE FACE HER CHANGED MOURNING DRESS THE TREMBLINGABOUT HER MOUTH ALL SAID I KNOW AND HER HANDS AND EYES RESTEDGENTLY ON HIM
 HE BURST OUT CRYING AND THEY CRIED TOGETHER SHE SITTINGAT HIS SIDE
 THEY COULD NOT YET SPEAK TO EACH OTHER OF THE SHAME WHICHSHE WAS BEARING WITH HIM OR OF THE ACTS WHICH HAD BROUGHT IT DOWN ONTHEM
 HIS CONFESSION WAS SILENT AND HER PROMISE OF FAITHFULNESS WASSILENT
 OPENMINDED AS SHE WAS SHE NEVERTHELESS SHRANK FROM THE WORDSWHICH WOULD HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR MUTUAL CONSCIOUSNESS AS SHE WOULDHAVE SHRUNK FROM FLAKES OF FIRE
 SHE COULD NOT SAY HOW MUCH IS ONLYSLANDER AND FALSE SUSPICION
 AND HE DID NOT SAY I AM INNOCENT
CHAPTER LXXV

PASCAL
ROSAMOND HAD A GLEAM OF RETURNING CHEERFULNESS WHEN THE HOUSE WAS FREEDFROM THE THREATENING FIGURE AND WHEN ALL THE DISAGREEABLE CREDITORSWERE PAID
 BUT SHE WAS NOT JOYOUS HER MARRIED LIFE HAD FULFILLED NONEOF HER HOPES AND HAD BEEN QUITE SPOILED FOR HER IMAGINATION
 IN THISBRIEF INTERVAL OF CALM LYDGATE REMEMBERING THAT HE HAD OFTEN BEENSTORMY IN HIS HOURS OF PERTURBATION AND MINDFUL OF THE PAIN ROSAMONDHAD HAD TO BEAR WAS CAREFULLY GENTLE TOWARDS HER BUT HE TOO HADLOST SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AND HE STILL FELT IT NECESSARY TO REFER TOAN ECONOMICAL CHANGE IN THEIR WAY OF LIVING AS A MATTER OF COURSETRYING TO RECONCILE HER TO IT GRADUALLY AND REPRESSING HIS ANGER WHENSHE ANSWERED BY WISHING THAT HE WOULD GO TO LIVE IN LONDON
 WHEN SHEDID NOT MAKE THIS ANSWER SHE LISTENED LANGUIDLY AND WONDERED WHAT SHEHAD THAT WAS WORTH LIVING FOR
 THE HARD AND CONTEMPTUOUS WORDS WHICHHAD FALLEN FROM HER HUSBAND IN HIS ANGER HAD DEEPLY OFFENDED THATVANITY WHICH HE HAD AT FIRST CALLED INTO ACTIVE ENJOYMENT AND WHAT SHEREGARDED AS HIS PERVERSE WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS KEPT UP A SECRETREPULSION WHICH MADE HER RECEIVE ALL HIS TENDERNESS AS A POORSUBSTITUTE FOR THE HAPPINESS HE HAD FAILED TO GIVE HER
 THEY WERE AT ADISADVANTAGE WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS AND THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY OUTLOOKTOWARDS QUALLINGHAMTHERE WAS NO OUTLOOK ANYWHERE EXCEPT IN ANOCCASIONAL LETTER FROM WILL LADISLAW
 SHE HAD FELT STUNG ANDDISAPPOINTED BY WILLS RESOLUTION TO QUIT MIDDLEMARCH FOR IN SPITE OFWHAT SHE KNEW AND GUESSED ABOUT HIS ADMIRATION FOR DOROTHEA SHESECRETLY CHERISHED THE BELIEF THAT HE HAD OR WOULD NECESSARILY COME TOHAVE MUCH MORE ADMIRATION FOR HERSELF ROSAMOND BEING ONE OF THOSEWOMEN WHO LIVE MUCH IN THE IDEA THAT EACH MAN THEY MEET WOULD HAVEPREFERRED THEM IF THE PREFERENCE HAD NOT BEEN HOPELESS
 MRS
 CASAUBONWAS ALL VERY WELL BUT WILLS INTEREST IN HER DATED BEFORE HE KNEW MRS
LYDGATE
 ROSAMOND TOOK HIS WAY OF TALKING TO HERSELF WHICH WAS AMIXTURE OF PLAYFUL FAULTFINDING AND HYPERBOLICAL GALLANTRY AS THEDISGUISE OF A DEEPER FEELING AND IN HIS PRESENCE SHE FELT THATAGREEABLE TITILLATION OF VANITY AND SENSE OF ROMANTIC DRAMA WHICHLYDGATES PRESENCE HAD NO LONGER THE MAGIC TO CREATE
 SHE EVENFANCIEDWHAT WILL NOT MEN AND WOMEN FANCY IN THESE MATTERS
THAT WILLEXAGGERATED HIS ADMIRATION FOR MRS
 CASAUBON IN ORDER TO PIQUE HERSELF
IN THIS WAY POOR ROSAMONDS BRAIN HAD BEEN BUSY BEFORE WILLSDEPARTURE
 HE WOULD HAVE MADE SHE THOUGHT A MUCH MORE SUITABLEHUSBAND FOR HER THAN SHE HAD FOUND IN LYDGATE
 NO NOTION COULD HAVEBEEN FALSER THAN THIS FOR ROSAMONDS DISCONTENT IN HER MARRIAGE WASDUE TO THE CONDITIONS OF MARRIAGE ITSELF TO ITS DEMAND FORSELFSUPPRESSION AND TOLERANCE AND NOT TO THE NATURE OF HER HUSBANDBUT THE EASY CONCEPTION OF AN UNREAL BETTER HAD A SENTIMENTAL CHARMWHICH DIVERTED HER ENNUI
 SHE CONSTRUCTED A LITTLE ROMANCE WHICH WAS TOVARY THE FLATNESS OF HER LIFE WILL LADISLAW WAS ALWAYS TO BE ABACHELOR AND LIVE NEAR HER ALWAYS TO BE AT HER COMMAND AND HAVE ANUNDERSTOOD THOUGH NEVER FULLY EXPRESSED PASSION FOR HER WHICH WOULD BESENDING OUT LAMBENT FLAMES EVERY NOW AND THEN IN INTERESTING SCENES
HIS DEPARTURE HAD BEEN A PROPORTIONATE DISAPPOINTMENT AND HAD SADLYINCREASED HER WEARINESS OF MIDDLEMARCH BUT AT FIRST SHE HAD THEALTERNATIVE DREAM OF PLEASURES IN STORE FROM HER INTERCOURSE WITH THEFAMILY AT QUALLINGHAM
 SINCE THEN THE TROUBLES OF HER MARRIED LIFE HADDEEPENED AND THE ABSENCE OF OTHER RELIEF ENCOURAGED HER REGRETFULRUMINATION OVER THAT THIN ROMANCE WHICH SHE HAD ONCE FED ON
 MEN ANDWOMEN MAKE SAD MISTAKES ABOUT THEIR OWN SYMPTOMS TAKING THEIR VAGUEUNEASY LONGINGS SOMETIMES FOR GENIUS SOMETIMES FOR RELIGION ANDOFTENER STILL FOR A MIGHTY LOVE
 WILL LADISLAW HAD WRITTEN CHATTYLETTERS HALF TO HER AND HALF TO LYDGATE AND SHE HAD REPLIED THEIRSEPARATION SHE FELT WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE FINAL AND THE CHANGE SHENOW MOST LONGED FOR WAS THAT LYDGATE SHOULD GO TO LIVE IN LONDONEVERYTHING WOULD BE AGREEABLE IN LONDON AND SHE HAD SET TO WORK WITHQUIET DETERMINATION TO WIN THIS RESULT WHEN THERE CAME A SUDDENDELIGHTFUL PROMISE WHICH INSPIRITED HER
IT CAME SHORTLY BEFORE THE MEMORABLE MEETING AT THE TOWNHALL AND WASNOTHING LESS THAN A LETTER FROM WILL LADISLAW TO LYDGATE WHICH TURNEDINDEED CHIEFLY ON HIS NEW INTEREST IN PLANS OF COLONIZATION BUTMENTIONED INCIDENTALLY THAT HE MIGHT FIND IT NECESSARY TO PAY A VISITTO MIDDLEMARCH WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKSA VERY PLEASANT NECESSITY HESAID ALMOST AS GOOD AS HOLIDAYS TO A SCHOOLBOY
 HE HOPED THERE WAS HISOLD PLACE ON THE RUG AND A GREAT DEAL OF MUSIC IN STORE FOR HIM
 BUTHE WAS QUITE UNCERTAIN AS TO THE TIME
 WHILE LYDGATE WAS READING THELETTER TO ROSAMOND HER FACE LOOKED LIKE A REVIVING FLOWERIT GREWPRETTIER AND MORE BLOOMING
 THERE WAS NOTHING UNENDURABLE NOW THEDEBTS WERE PAID MR
 LADISLAW WAS COMING AND LYDGATE WOULD BEPERSUADED TO LEAVE MIDDLEMARCH AND SETTLE IN LONDON WHICH WAS SODIFFERENT FROM A PROVINCIAL TOWN
THAT WAS A BRIGHT BIT OF MORNING
 BUT SOON THE SKY BECAME BLACK OVERPOOR ROSAMOND
 THE PRESENCE OF A NEW GLOOM IN HER HUSBAND ABOUT WHICHHE WAS ENTIRELY RESERVED TOWARDS HERFOR HE DREADED TO EXPOSE HISLACERATED FEELING TO HER NEUTRALITY AND MISCONCEPTIONSOON RECEIVED APAINFULLY STRANGE EXPLANATION ALIEN TO ALL HER PREVIOUS NOTIONS OFWHAT COULD AFFECT HER HAPPINESS
 IN THE NEW GAYETY OF HER SPIRITSTHINKING THAT LYDGATE HAD MERELY A WORSE FIT OF MOODINESS THAN USUALCAUSING HIM TO LEAVE HER REMARKS UNANSWERED AND EVIDENTLY TO KEEP OUTOF HER WAY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SHE CHOSE A FEW DAYS AFTER THEMEETING AND WITHOUT SPEAKING TO HIM ON THE SUBJECT TO SEND OUT NOTESOF INVITATION FOR A SMALL EVENING PARTY FEELING CONVINCED THAT THISWAS A JUDICIOUS STEP SINCE PEOPLE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN KEEPING ALOOFFROM THEM AND WANTED RESTORING TO THE OLD HABIT OF INTERCOURSE
 WHENTHE INVITATIONS HAD BEEN ACCEPTED SHE WOULD TELL LYDGATE AND GIVE HIMA WISE ADMONITION AS TO HOW A MEDICAL MAN SHOULD BEHAVE TO HISNEIGHBORS FOR ROSAMOND HAD THE GRAVEST LITTLE AIRS POSSIBLE ABOUTOTHER PEOPLES DUTIES
 BUT ALL THE INVITATIONS WERE DECLINED AND THELAST ANSWER CAME INTO LYDGATES HANDS
THIS IS CHICHELYS SCRATCH
 WHAT IS HE WRITING TO YOU ABOUT
 SAIDLYDGATE WONDERINGLY AS HE HANDED THE NOTE TO HER
 SHE WAS OBLIGED TOLET HIM SEE IT AND LOOKING AT HER SEVERELY HE SAIDWHY ON EARTH HAVE YOU BEEN SENDING OUT INVITATIONS WITHOUT TELLING MEROSAMOND
 I BEG I INSIST THAT YOU WILL NOT INVITE ANY ONE TO THISHOUSE
 I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE BEEN INVITING OTHERS AND THEY HAVE REFUSEDTOO
 SHE SAID NOTHING
DO YOU HEAR ME
 THUNDERED LYDGATE
YES CERTAINLY I HEAR YOU SAID ROSAMOND TURNING HER HEAD ASIDE WITHTHE MOVEMENT OF A GRACEFUL LONGNECKED BIRD
LYDGATE TOSSED HIS HEAD WITHOUT ANY GRACE AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOMFEELING HIMSELF DANGEROUS
 ROSAMONDS THOUGHT WAS THAT HE WAS GETTINGMORE AND MORE UNBEARABLENOT THAT THERE WAS ANY NEW SPECIAL REASON FORTHIS PEREMPTORINESS
 HIS INDISPOSITION TO TELL HER ANYTHING IN WHICH HEWAS SURE BEFOREHAND THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE INTERESTED WAS GROWING INTOAN UNREFLECTING HABIT AND SHE WAS IN IGNORANCE OF EVERYTHING CONNECTEDWITH THE THOUSAND POUNDS EXCEPT THAT THE LOAN HAD COME FROM HER UNCLEBULSTRODE
 LYDGATES ODIOUS HUMORS AND THEIR NEIGHBORS APPARENTAVOIDANCE OF THEM HAD AN UNACCOUNTABLE DATE FOR HER IN THEIR RELIEFFROM MONEY DIFFICULTIES
 IF THE INVITATIONS HAD BEEN ACCEPTED SHE WOULDHAVE GONE TO INVITE HER MAMMA AND THE REST WHOM SHE HAD SEEN NOTHINGOF FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND SHE NOW PUT ON HER BONNET TO GO AND INQUIREWHAT HAD BECOME OF THEM ALL SUDDENLY FEELING AS IF THERE WERE ACONSPIRACY TO LEAVE HER IN ISOLATION WITH A HUSBAND DISPOSED TO OFFENDEVERYBODY
 IT WAS AFTER THE DINNER HOUR AND SHE FOUND HER FATHER ANDMOTHER SEATED TOGETHER ALONE IN THE DRAWINGROOM
 THEY GREETED HER WITHSAD LOOKS SAYING WELL MY DEAR
 AND NO MORE
 SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HERFATHER LOOK SO DOWNCAST AND SEATING HERSELF NEAR HIM SHE SAIDIS THERE ANYTHING THE MATTER PAPA
HE DID NOT ANSWER BUT MRS
 VINCY SAID OH MY DEAR HAVE YOU HEARDNOTHING
 IT WONT BE LONG BEFORE IT REACHES YOU
IS IT ANYTHING ABOUT TERTIUS
 SAID ROSAMOND TURNING PALE
 THE IDEAOF TROUBLE IMMEDIATELY CONNECTED ITSELF WITH WHAT HAD BEENUNACCOUNTABLE TO HER IN HIM
OH MY DEAR YES
 TO THINK OF YOUR MARRYING INTO THIS TROUBLE
 DEBTWAS BAD ENOUGH BUT THIS WILL BE WORSE
STAY STAY LUCY SAID MR
 VINCY
 HAVE YOU HEARD NOTHING ABOUT YOURUNCLE BULSTRODE ROSAMOND
NO PAPA SAID THE POOR THING FEELING AS IF TROUBLE WERE NOTANYTHING SHE HAD BEFORE EXPERIENCED BUT SOME INVISIBLE POWER WITH ANIRON GRASP THAT MADE HER SOUL FAINT WITHIN HER
HER FATHER TOLD HER EVERYTHING SAYING AT THE END ITS BETTER FOR YOUTO KNOW MY DEAR
 I THINK LYDGATE MUST LEAVE THE TOWN
 THINGS HAVE GONEAGAINST HIM
 I DARE SAY HE COULDNT HELP IT
 I DONT ACCUSE HIM OF ANYHARM SAID MR
 VINCY
 HE HAD ALWAYS BEFORE BEEN DISPOSED TO FIND THEUTMOST FAULT WITH LYDGATE
THE SHOCK TO ROSAMOND WAS TERRIBLE
 IT SEEMED TO HER THAT NO LOT COULDBE SO CRUELLY HARD AS HERS TO HAVE MARRIED A MAN WHO HAD BECOME THECENTRE OF INFAMOUS SUSPICIONS
 IN MANY CASES IT IS INEVITABLE THAT THESHAME IS FELT TO BE THE WORST PART OF CRIME AND IT WOULD HAVE REQUIREDA GREAT DEAL OF DISENTANGLING REFLECTION SUCH AS HAD NEVER ENTEREDINTO ROSAMONDS LIFE FOR HER IN THESE MOMENTS TO FEEL THAT HER TROUBLEWAS LESS THAN IF HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN CERTAINLY KNOWN TO HAVE DONESOMETHING CRIMINAL
 ALL THE SHAME SEEMED TO BE THERE
 AND SHE HADINNOCENTLY MARRIED THIS MAN WITH THE BELIEF THAT HE AND HIS FAMILY WEREA GLORY TO HER
 SHE SHOWED HER USUAL RETICENCE TO HER PARENTS AND ONLYSAID THAT IF LYDGATE HAD DONE AS SHE WISHED HE WOULD HAVE LEFTMIDDLEMARCH LONG AGO
SHE BEARS IT BEYOND ANYTHING SAID HER MOTHER WHEN SHE WAS GONE
AH THANK GOD
 SAID MR
 VINCY WHO WAS MUCH BROKEN DOWN
BUT ROSAMOND WENT HOME WITH A SENSE OF JUSTIFIED REPUGNANCE TOWARDS HERHUSBAND
 WHAT HAD HE REALLY DONEHOW HAD HE REALLY ACTED
 SHE DID NOTKNOW
 WHY HAD HE NOT TOLD HER EVERYTHING
 HE DID NOT SPEAK TO HER ONTHE SUBJECT AND OF COURSE SHE COULD NOT SPEAK TO HIM
 IT CAME INTO HERMIND ONCE THAT SHE WOULD ASK HER FATHER TO LET HER GO HOME AGAIN BUTDWELLING ON THAT PROSPECT MADE IT SEEM UTTER DREARINESS TO HER AMARRIED WOMAN GONE BACK TO LIVE WITH HER PARENTSLIFE SEEMED TO HAVE NOMEANING FOR HER IN SUCH A POSITION SHE COULD NOT CONTEMPLATE HERSELFIN IT
THE NEXT TWO DAYS LYDGATE OBSERVED A CHANGE IN HER AND BELIEVED THATSHE HAD HEARD THE BAD NEWS
 WOULD SHE SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT IT OR WOULDSHE GO ON FOREVER IN THE SILENCE WHICH SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT SHEBELIEVED HIM GUILTY
 WE MUST REMEMBER THAT HE WAS IN A MORBID STATE OFMIND IN WHICH ALMOST ALL CONTACT WAS PAIN
 CERTAINLY ROSAMOND IN THISCASE HAD EQUAL REASON TO COMPLAIN OF RESERVE AND WANT OF CONFIDENCE ONHIS PART BUT IN THE BITTERNESS OF HIS SOUL HE EXCUSED HIMSELFWAS HENOT JUSTIFIED IN SHRINKING FROM THE TASK OF TELLING HER SINCE NOW SHEKNEW THE TRUTH SHE HAD NO IMPULSE TO SPEAK TO HIM
 BUT A DEEPERLYINGCONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE WAS IN FAULT MADE HIM RESTLESS AND THE SILENCEBETWEEN THEM BECAME INTOLERABLE TO HIM IT WAS AS IF THEY WERE BOTHADRIFT ON ONE PIECE OF WRECK AND LOOKED AWAY FROM EACH OTHER
HE THOUGHT I AM A FOOL
 HAVENT I GIVEN UP EXPECTING ANYTHING
 I HAVEMARRIED CARE NOT HELP
 AND THAT EVENING HE SAIDROSAMOND HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING THAT DISTRESSES YOU
YES SHE ANSWERED LAYING DOWN HER WORK WHICH SHE HAD BEEN CARRYINGON WITH A LANGUID SEMICONSCIOUSNESS MOST UNLIKE HER USUAL SELF
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD
EVERYTHING I SUPPOSE
 PAPA TOLD ME
THAT PEOPLE THINK ME DISGRACED
YES SAID ROSAMOND FAINTLY BEGINNING TO SEW AGAIN AUTOMATICALLY
THERE WAS SILENCE
 LYDGATE THOUGHT IF SHE HAS ANY TRUST IN MEANYNOTION OF WHAT I AM SHE OUGHT TO SPEAK NOW AND SAY THAT SHE DOES NOTBELIEVE I HAVE DESERVED DISGRACE
BUT ROSAMOND ON HER SIDE WENT ON MOVING HER FINGERS LANGUIDLY
 WHATEVERWAS TO BE SAID ON THE SUBJECT SHE EXPECTED TO COME FROM TERTIUS
 WHATDID SHE KNOW
 AND IF HE WERE INNOCENT OF ANY WRONG WHY DID HE NOT DOSOMETHING TO CLEAR HIMSELF
THIS SILENCE OF HERS BROUGHT A NEW RUSH OF GALL TO THAT BITTER MOOD INWHICH LYDGATE HAD BEEN SAYING TO HIMSELF THAT NOBODY BELIEVED INHIMEVEN FAREBROTHER HAD NOT COME FORWARD
 HE HAD BEGUN TO QUESTION HERWITH THE INTENT THAT THEIR CONVERSATION SHOULD DISPERSE THE CHILL FOGWHICH HAD GATHERED BETWEEN THEM BUT HE FELT HIS RESOLUTION CHECKED BYDESPAIRING RESENTMENT
 EVEN THIS TROUBLE LIKE THE REST SHE SEEMED TOREGARD AS IF IT WERE HERS ALONE
 HE WAS ALWAYS TO HER A BEING APARTDOING WHAT SHE OBJECTED TO
 HE STARTED FROM HIS CHAIR WITH AN ANGRYIMPULSE AND THRUSTING HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS WALKED UP AND DOWN THEROOM
 THERE WAS AN UNDERLYING CONSCIOUSNESS ALL THE WHILE THAT HESHOULD HAVE TO MASTER THIS ANGER AND TELL HER EVERYTHING AND CONVINCEHER OF THE FACTS
 FOR HE HAD ALMOST LEARNED THE LESSON THAT HE MUSTBEND HIMSELF TO HER NATURE AND THAT BECAUSE SHE CAME SHORT IN HERSYMPATHY HE MUST GIVE THE MORE
 SOON HE RECURRED TO HIS INTENTION OFOPENING HIMSELF THE OCCASION MUST NOT BE LOST
 IF HE COULD BRING HERTO FEEL WITH SOME SOLEMNITY THAT HERE WAS A SLANDER WHICH MUST BE METAND NOT RUN AWAY FROM AND THAT THE WHOLE TROUBLE HAD COME OUT OF HISDESPERATE WANT OF MONEY IT WOULD BE A MOMENT FOR URGING POWERFULLY ONHER THAT THEY SHOULD BE ONE IN THE RESOLVE TO DO WITH AS LITTLE MONEYAS POSSIBLE SO THAT THEY MIGHT WEATHER THE BAD TIME AND KEEPTHEMSELVES INDEPENDENT
 HE WOULD MENTION THE DEFINITE MEASURES WHICH HEDESIRED TO TAKE AND WIN HER TO A WILLING SPIRIT
 HE WAS BOUND TO TRYTHISAND WHAT ELSE WAS THERE FOR HIM TO DO
HE DID NOT KNOW HOW LONG HE HAD BEEN WALKING UNEASILY BACKWARDS ANDFORWARDS BUT ROSAMOND FELT THAT IT WAS LONG AND WISHED THAT HE WOULDSIT DOWN
 SHE TOO HAD BEGUN TO THINK THIS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR URGING ONTERTIUS WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO
 WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE TRUTH ABOUT ALL THISMISERY THERE WAS ONE DREAD WHICH ASSERTED ITSELF
LYDGATE AT LAST SEATED HIMSELF NOT IN HIS USUAL CHAIR BUT IN ONENEARER TO ROSAMOND LEANING ASIDE IN IT TOWARDS HER AND LOOKING AT HERGRAVELY BEFORE HE REOPENED THE SAD SUBJECT
 HE HAD CONQUERED HIMSELF SOFAR AND WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK WITH A SENSE OF SOLEMNITY AS ON ANOCCASION WHICH WAS NOT TO BE REPEATED
 HE HAD EVEN OPENED HIS LIPSWHEN ROSAMOND LETTING HER HANDS FALL LOOKED AT HIM AND SAIDSURELY TERTIUSWELL
SURELY NOW AT LAST YOU HAVE GIVEN UP THE IDEA OF STAYING INMIDDLEMARCH
 I CANNOT GO ON LIVING HERE
 LET US GO TO LONDON
 PAPA ANDEVERY ONE ELSE SAYS YOU HAD BETTER GO
 WHATEVER MISERY I HAVE TO PUTUP WITH IT WILL BE EASIER AWAY FROM HERE
LYDGATE FELT MISERABLY JARRED
 INSTEAD OF THAT CRITICAL OUTPOURING FORWHICH HE HAD PREPARED HIMSELF WITH EFFORT HERE WAS THE OLD ROUND TO BEGONE THROUGH AGAIN
 HE COULD NOT BEAR IT
 WITH A QUICK CHANGE OFCOUNTENANCE HE ROSE AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM
PERHAPS IF HE HAD BEEN STRONG ENOUGH TO PERSIST IN HIS DETERMINATION TOBE THE MORE BECAUSE SHE WAS LESS THAT EVENING MIGHT HAVE HAD A BETTERISSUE
 IF HIS ENERGY COULD HAVE BORNE DOWN THAT CHECK HE MIGHT STILLHAVE WROUGHT ON ROSAMONDS VISION AND WILL
 WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT ANYNATURES HOWEVER INFLEXIBLE OR PECULIAR WILL RESIST THIS EFFECT FROM AMORE MASSIVE BEING THAN THEIR OWN
 THEY MAY BE TAKEN BY STORM AND FORTHE MOMENT CONVERTED BECOMING PART OF THE SOUL WHICH ENWRAPS THEM INTHE ARDOR OF ITS MOVEMENT
 BUT POOR LYDGATE HAD A THROBBING PAIN WITHINHIM AND HIS ENERGY HAD FALLEN SHORT OF ITS TASK
THE BEGINNING OF MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND RESOLVE SEEMED AS FAR OFF ASEVER NAY IT SEEMED BLOCKED OUT BY THE SENSE OF UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORT
THEY LIVED ON FROM DAY TO DAY WITH THEIR THOUGHTS STILL APART LYDGATEGOING ABOUT WHAT WORK HE HAD IN A MOOD OF DESPAIR AND ROSAMONDFEELING WITH SOME JUSTIFICATION THAT HE WAS BEHAVING CRUELLY
 IT WASOF NO USE TO SAY ANYTHING TO TERTIUS BUT WHEN WILL LADISLAW CAME SHEWAS DETERMINED TO TELL HIM EVERYTHING
 IN SPITE OF HER GENERALRETICENCE SHE NEEDED SOME ONE WHO WOULD RECOGNIZE HER WRONGS

SOME DAYS LATER LYDGATE WAS RIDING TO LOWICK MANOR IN CONSEQUENCE OFA SUMMONS FROM DOROTHEA
 THE SUMMONS HAD NOT BEEN UNEXPECTED SINCE ITHAD FOLLOWED A LETTER FROM MR
 BULSTRODE IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HEHAD RESUMED HIS ARRANGEMENTS FOR QUITTING MIDDLEMARCH AND MUST REMINDLYDGATE OF HIS PREVIOUS COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT THE HOSPITAL TO THEPURPORT OF WHICH HE STILL ADHERED
 IT HAD BEEN HIS DUTY BEFORE TAKINGFURTHER STEPS TO REOPEN THE SUBJECT WITH MRS
 CASAUBON WHO NOWWISHED AS BEFORE TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION WITH LYDGATE
 YOUR VIEWSMAY POSSIBLY HAVE UNDERGONE SOME CHANGE WROTE MR
 BULSTRODE BUT INTHAT CASE ALSO IT IS DESIRABLE THAT YOU SHOULD LAY THEM BEFORE HER
DOROTHEA AWAITED HIS ARRIVAL WITH EAGER INTEREST
 THOUGH IN DEFERENCETO HER MASCULINE ADVISERS SHE HAD REFRAINED FROM WHAT SIR JAMES HADCALLED INTERFERING IN THIS BULSTRODE BUSINESS THE HARDSHIP OFLYDGATES POSITION WAS CONTINUALLY IN HER MIND AND WHEN BULSTRODEAPPLIED TO HER AGAIN ABOUT THE HOSPITAL SHE FELT THAT THE OPPORTUNITYWAS COME TO HER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN HINDERED FROM HASTENING
 IN HERLUXURIOUS HOME WANDERING UNDER THE BOUGHS OF HER OWN GREAT TREES HERTHOUGHT WAS GOING OUT OVER THE LOT OF OTHERS AND HER EMOTIONS WEREIMPRISONED
 THE IDEA OF SOME ACTIVE GOOD WITHIN HER REACH HAUNTED HERLIKE A PASSION AND ANOTHERS NEED HAVING ONCE COME TO HER AS ADISTINCT IMAGE PREOCCUPIED HER DESIRE WITH THE YEARNING TO GIVERELIEF AND MADE HER OWN EASE TASTELESS
 SHE WAS FULL OF CONFIDENT HOPEABOUT THIS INTERVIEW WITH LYDGATE NEVER HEEDING WHAT WAS SAID OF HISPERSONAL RESERVE NEVER HEEDING THAT SHE WAS A VERY YOUNG WOMAN
NOTHING COULD HAVE SEEMED MORE IRRELEVANT TO DOROTHEA THAN INSISTENCEON HER YOUTH AND SEX WHEN SHE WAS MOVED TO SHOW HER HUMAN FELLOWSHIP
AS SHE SAT WAITING IN THE LIBRARY SHE COULD DO NOTHING BUT LIVETHROUGH AGAIN ALL THE PAST SCENES WHICH HAD BROUGHT LYDGATE INTO HERMEMORIES
 THEY ALL OWED THEIR SIGNIFICANCE TO HER MARRIAGE AND ITSTROUBLESBUT NO THERE WERE TWO OCCASIONS IN WHICH THE IMAGE OF LYDGATEHAD COME PAINFULLY IN CONNECTION WITH HIS WIFE AND SOME ONE ELSE
 THEPAIN HAD BEEN ALLAYED FOR DOROTHEA BUT IT HAD LEFT IN HER AN AWAKENEDCONJECTURE AS TO WHAT LYDGATES MARRIAGE MIGHT BE TO HIM ASUSCEPTIBILITY TO THE SLIGHTEST HINT ABOUT MRS
 LYDGATE
 THESE THOUGHTSWERE LIKE A DRAMA TO HER AND MADE HER EYES BRIGHT AND GAVE ANATTITUDE OF SUSPENSE TO HER WHOLE FRAME THOUGH SHE WAS ONLY LOOKINGOUT FROM THE BROWN LIBRARY ON TO THE TURF AND THE BRIGHT GREEN BUDSWHICH STOOD IN RELIEF AGAINST THE DARK EVERGREENS
WHEN LYDGATE CAME IN SHE WAS ALMOST SHOCKED AT THE CHANGE IN HIS FACEWHICH WAS STRIKINGLY PERCEPTIBLE TO HER WHO HAD NOT SEEN HIM FOR TWOMONTHS
 IT WAS NOT THE CHANGE OF EMACIATION BUT THAT EFFECT WHICH EVENYOUNG FACES WILL VERY SOON SHOW FROM THE PERSISTENT PRESENCE OFRESENTMENT AND DESPONDENCY
 HER CORDIAL LOOK WHEN SHE PUT OUT HER HANDTO HIM SOFTENED HIS EXPRESSION BUT ONLY WITH MELANCHOLY
I HAVE WISHED VERY MUCH TO SEE YOU FOR A LONG WHILE MR
 LYDGATESAID DOROTHEA WHEN THEY WERE SEATED OPPOSITE EACH OTHER BUT I PUT OFFASKING YOU TO COME UNTIL MR
 BULSTRODE APPLIED TO ME AGAIN ABOUT THEHOSPITAL
 I KNOW THAT THE ADVANTAGE OF KEEPING THE MANAGEMENT OF ITSEPARATE FROM THAT OF THE INFIRMARY DEPENDS ON YOU OR AT LEAST ONTHE GOOD WHICH YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO HOPE FOR FROM HAVING IT UNDER YOURCONTROL
 AND I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT REFUSE TO TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT YOUTHINK
YOU WANT TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU SHOULD GIVE A GENEROUS SUPPORT TO THEHOSPITAL SAID LYDGATE
 I CANNOT CONSCIENTIOUSLY ADVISE YOU TO DO ITIN DEPENDENCE ON ANY ACTIVITY OF MINE
 I MAY BE OBLIGED TO LEAVE THETOWN
HE SPOKE CURTLY FEELING THE ACHE OF DESPAIR AS TO HIS BEING ABLE TOCARRY OUT ANY PURPOSE THAT ROSAMOND HAD SET HER MIND AGAINST
NOT BECAUSE THERE IS NO ONE TO BELIEVE IN YOU
 SAID DOROTHEA POURINGOUT HER WORDS IN CLEARNESS FROM A FULL HEART
 I KNOW THE UNHAPPYMISTAKES ABOUT YOU
 I KNEW THEM FROM THE FIRST MOMENT TO BE MISTAKES
YOU HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING VILE
 YOU WOULD NOT DO ANYTHINGDISHONORABLE
IT WAS THE FIRST ASSURANCE OF BELIEF IN HIM THAT HAD FALLEN ONLYDGATES EARS
 HE DREW A DEEP BREATH AND SAID THANK YOU
 HE COULDSAY NO MORE IT WAS SOMETHING VERY NEW AND STRANGE IN HIS LIFE THATTHESE FEW WORDS OF TRUST FROM A WOMAN SHOULD BE SO MUCH TO HIM
I BESEECH YOU TO TELL ME HOW EVERYTHING WAS SAID DOROTHEAFEARLESSLY
 I AM SURE THAT THE TRUTH WOULD CLEAR YOU
LYDGATE STARTED UP FROM HIS CHAIR AND WENT TOWARDS THE WINDOWFORGETTING WHERE HE WAS
 HE HAD SO OFTEN GONE OVER IN HIS MIND THEPOSSIBILITY OF EXPLAINING EVERYTHING WITHOUT AGGRAVATING APPEARANCESTHAT WOULD TELL PERHAPS UNFAIRLY AGAINST BULSTRODE AND HAD SO OFTENDECIDED AGAINST ITHE HAD SO OFTEN SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HIS ASSERTIONSWOULD NOT CHANGE PEOPLES IMPRESSIONSTHAT DOROTHEAS WORDS SOUNDEDLIKE A TEMPTATION TO DO SOMETHING WHICH IN HIS SOBERNESS HE HADPRONOUNCED TO BE UNREASONABLE
TELL ME PRAY SAID DOROTHEA WITH SIMPLE EARNESTNESS THEN WE CANCONSULT TOGETHER
 IT IS WICKED TO LET PEOPLE THINK EVIL OF ANY ONEFALSELY WHEN IT CAN BE HINDERED
LYDGATE TURNED REMEMBERING WHERE HE WAS AND SAW DOROTHEAS FACELOOKING UP AT HIM WITH A SWEET TRUSTFUL GRAVITY
 THE PRESENCE OF ANOBLE NATURE GENEROUS IN ITS WISHES ARDENT IN ITS CHARITY CHANGESTHE LIGHTS FOR US WE BEGIN TO SEE THINGS AGAIN IN THEIR LARGERQUIETER MASSES AND TO BELIEVE THAT WE TOO CAN BE SEEN AND JUDGED INTHE WHOLENESS OF OUR CHARACTER
 THAT INFLUENCE WAS BEGINNING TO ACT ONLYDGATE WHO HAD FOR MANY DAYS BEEN SEEING ALL LIFE AS ONE WHO ISDRAGGED AND STRUGGLING AMID THE THRONG
 HE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND FELTTHAT HE WAS RECOVERING HIS OLD SELF IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE WASWITH ONE WHO BELIEVED IN IT
I DONT WANT HE SAID TO BEAR HARD ON BULSTRODE WHO HAS LENT MEMONEY OF WHICH I WAS IN NEEDTHOUGH I WOULD RATHER HAVE GONE WITHOUT ITNOW
 HE IS HUNTED DOWN AND MISERABLE AND HAS ONLY A POOR THREAD OFLIFE IN HIM
 BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING
 IT WILL BE ACOMFORT TO ME TO SPEAK WHERE BELIEF HAS GONE BEFOREHAND AND WHERE ISHALL NOT SEEM TO BE OFFERING ASSERTIONS OF MY OWN HONESTY
 YOU WILLFEEL WHAT IS FAIR TO ANOTHER AS YOU FEEL WHAT IS FAIR TO ME
DO TRUST ME SAID DOROTHEA I WILL NOT REPEAT ANYTHING WITHOUT YOURLEAVE
 BUT AT THE VERY LEAST I COULD SAY THAT YOU HAVE MADE ALL THECIRCUMSTANCES CLEAR TO ME AND THAT I KNOW YOU ARE NOT IN ANY WAYGUILTY
 MR
 FAREBROTHER WOULD BELIEVE ME AND MY UNCLE AND SIR JAMESCHETTAM
 NAY THERE ARE PERSONS IN MIDDLEMARCH TO WHOM I COULD GOALTHOUGH THEY DONT KNOW MUCH OF ME THEY WOULD BELIEVE ME
 THEY WOULDKNOW THAT I COULD HAVE NO OTHER MOTIVE THAN TRUTH AND JUSTICE
 I WOULDTAKE ANY PAINS TO CLEAR YOU
 I HAVE VERY LITTLE TO DO
 THERE IS NOTHINGBETTER THAT I CAN DO IN THE WORLD
DOROTHEAS VOICE AS SHE MADE THIS CHILDLIKE PICTURE OF WHAT SHE WOULDDO MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALMOST TAKEN AS A PROOF THAT SHE COULD DO ITEFFECTIVELY
 THE SEARCHING TENDERNESS OF HER WOMANS TONES SEEMED MADEFOR A DEFENCE AGAINST READY ACCUSERS
 LYDGATE DID NOT STAY TO THINKTHAT SHE WAS QUIXOTIC HE GAVE HIMSELF UP FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISLIFE TO THE EXQUISITE SENSE OF LEANING ENTIRELY ON A GENEROUSSYMPATHY WITHOUT ANY CHECK OF PROUD RESERVE
 AND HE TOLD HEREVERYTHING FROM THE TIME WHEN UNDER THE PRESSURE OF HIS DIFFICULTIESHE UNWILLINGLY MADE HIS FIRST APPLICATION TO BULSTRODE GRADUALLY INTHE RELIEF OF SPEAKING GETTING INTO A MORE THOROUGH UTTERANCE OF WHATHAD GONE ON IN HIS MINDENTERING FULLY INTO THE FACT THAT HIS TREATMENTOF THE PATIENT WAS OPPOSED TO THE DOMINANT PRACTICE INTO HIS DOUBTS ATTHE LAST HIS IDEAL OF MEDICAL DUTY AND HIS UNEASY CONSCIOUSNESS THATTHE ACCEPTANCE OF THE MONEY HAD MADE SOME DIFFERENCE IN HIS PRIVATEINCLINATION AND PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR THOUGH NOT IN HIS FULFILMENT OFANY PUBLICLY RECOGNIZED OBLIGATION
IT HAS COME TO MY KNOWLEDGE SINCE HE ADDED THAT HAWLEY SENT SOMEONE TO EXAMINE THE HOUSEKEEPER AT STONE COURT AND SHE SAID THAT SHEGAVE THE PATIENT ALL THE OPIUM IN THE PHIAL I LEFT AS WELL AS A GOODDEAL OF BRANDY
 BUT THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO ORDINARYPRESCRIPTIONS EVEN OF FIRSTRATE MEN
 THE SUSPICIONS AGAINST ME HAD NOHOLD THERE THEY ARE GROUNDED ON THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I TOOK MONEY THATBULSTRODE HAD STRONG MOTIVES FOR WISHING THE MAN TO DIE AND THAT HEGAVE ME THE MONEY AS A BRIBE TO CONCUR IN SOME MALPRACTICES OR OTHERAGAINST THE PATIENTTHAT IN ANY CASE I ACCEPTED A BRIBE TO HOLD MYTONGUE
 THEY ARE JUST THE SUSPICIONS THAT CLING THE MOST OBSTINATELYBECAUSE THEY LIE IN PEOPLES INCLINATION AND CAN NEVER BE DISPROVED
HOW MY ORDERS CAME TO BE DISOBEYED IS A QUESTION TO WHICH I DONT KNOWTHE ANSWER
 IT IS STILL POSSIBLE THAT BULSTRODE WAS INNOCENT OF ANYCRIMINAL INTENTIONEVEN POSSIBLE THAT HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEDISOBEDIENCE AND MERELY ABSTAINED FROM MENTIONING IT
 BUT ALL THAT HASNOTHING TO DO WITH THE PUBLIC BELIEF
 IT IS ONE OF THOSE CASES ON WHICHA MAN IS CONDEMNED ON THE GROUND OF HIS CHARACTERIT IS BELIEVED THATHE HAS COMMITTED A CRIME IN SOME UNDEFINED WAY BECAUSE HE HAD THEMOTIVE FOR DOING IT AND BULSTRODES CHARACTER HAS ENVELOPED MEBECAUSE I TOOK HIS MONEY
 I AM SIMPLY BLIGHTEDLIKE A DAMAGED EAR OFCORNTHE BUSINESS IS DONE AND CANT BE UNDONE
OH IT IS HARD
 SAID DOROTHEA
 I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTY THERE ISIN YOUR VINDICATING YOURSELF
 AND THAT ALL THIS SHOULD HAVE COME TO YOUWHO HAD MEANT TO LEAD A HIGHER LIFE THAN THE COMMON AND TO FIND OUTBETTER WAYSI CANNOT BEAR TO REST IN THIS AS UNCHANGEABLE
 I KNOW YOUMEANT THAT
 I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME WHEN YOU FIRST SPOKE TO MEABOUT THE HOSPITAL
 THERE IS NO SORROW I HAVE THOUGHT MORE ABOUT THANTHATTO LOVE WHAT IS GREAT AND TRY TO REACH IT AND YET TO FAIL
YES SAID LYDGATE FEELING THAT HERE HE HAD FOUND ROOM FOR THE FULLMEANING OF HIS GRIEF
 I HAD SOME AMBITION
 I MEANT EVERYTHING TO BEDIFFERENT WITH ME
 I THOUGHT I HAD MORE STRENGTH AND MASTERY
 BUT THEMOST TERRIBLE OBSTACLES ARE SUCH AS NOBODY CAN SEE EXCEPT ONESELF
SUPPOSE SAID DOROTHEA MEDITATIVELYSUPPOSE WE KEPT ON THEHOSPITAL ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT PLAN AND YOU STAYED HERE THOUGH ONLYWITH THE FRIENDSHIP AND SUPPORT OF A FEW THE EVIL FEELING TOWARDS YOUWOULD GRADUALLY DIE OUT THERE WOULD COME OPPORTUNITIES IN WHICH PEOPLEWOULD BE FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAD BEEN UNJUST TO YOUBECAUSE THEY WOULD SEE THAT YOUR PURPOSES WERE PURE
 YOU MAY STILL WINA GREAT FAME LIKE THE LOUIS AND LAENNEC I HAVE HEARD YOU SPEAK OF ANDWE SHALL ALL BE PROUD OF YOU SHE ENDED WITH A SMILE
THAT MIGHT DO IF I HAD MY OLD TRUST IN MYSELF SAID LYDGATEMOURNFULLY
 NOTHING GALLS ME MORE THAN THE NOTION OF TURNING ROUND ANDRUNNING AWAY BEFORE THIS SLANDER LEAVING IT UNCHECKED BEHIND ME
STILL I CANT ASK ANY ONE TO PUT A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY INTO A PLANWHICH DEPENDS ON ME
IT WOULD BE QUITE WORTH MY WHILE SAID DOROTHEA SIMPLY
 ONLY THINK
I AM VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH MY MONEY BECAUSE THEY TELL ME I HAVE TOOLITTLE FOR ANY GREAT SCHEME OF THE SORT I LIKE BEST AND YET I HAVE TOOMUCH
 I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO
 I HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED AYEAR OF MY OWNFORTUNE AND NINETEEN HUNDRED AYEAR THAT MR
 CASAUBON LEFT ME ANDBETWEEN THREE AND FOUR THOUSAND OF READY MONEY IN THE BANK
 I WISHED TORAISE MONEY AND PAY IT OFF GRADUALLY OUT OF MY INCOME WHICH I DONTWANT TO BUY LAND WITH AND FOUND A VILLAGE WHICH SHOULD BE A SCHOOL OFINDUSTRY BUT SIR JAMES AND MY UNCLE HAVE CONVINCED ME THAT THE RISKWOULD BE TOO GREAT
 SO YOU SEE THAT WHAT I SHOULD MOST REJOICE AT WOULDBE TO HAVE SOMETHING GOOD TO DO WITH MY MONEY I SHOULD LIKE IT TO MAKEOTHER PEOPLES LIVES BETTER TO THEM
 IT MAKES ME VERY UNEASYCOMING ALLTO ME WHO DONT WANT IT
A SMILE BROKE THROUGH THE GLOOM OF LYDGATES FACE
 THE CHILDLIKEGRAVEEYED EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH DOROTHEA SAID ALL THIS WASIRRESISTIBLEBLENT INTO AN ADORABLE WHOLE WITH HER READY UNDERSTANDINGOF HIGH EXPERIENCE
 OF LOWER EXPERIENCE SUCH AS PLAYS A GREAT PART INTHE WORLD POOR MRS
 CASAUBON HAD A VERY BLURRED SHORTSIGHTEDKNOWLEDGE LITTLE HELPED BY HER IMAGINATION
 BUT SHE TOOK THE SMILE ASENCOURAGEMENT OF HER PLAN
I THINK YOU SEE NOW THAT YOU SPOKE TOO SCRUPULOUSLY SHE SAID IN ATONE OF PERSUASION
 THE HOSPITAL WOULD BE ONE GOOD AND MAKING YOURLIFE QUITE WHOLE AND WELL AGAIN WOULD BE ANOTHER
LYDGATES SMILE HAD DIED AWAY
 YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS AS WELL AS THEMONEY TO DO ALL THAT IF IT COULD BE DONE HE SAID
 BUTHE HESITATED A LITTLE WHILE LOOKING VAGUELY TOWARDS THE WINDOW ANDSHE SAT IN SILENT EXPECTATION
 AT LAST HE TURNED TOWARDS HER AND SAIDIMPETUOUSLYWHY SHOULD I NOT TELL YOU
YOU KNOW WHAT SORT OF BOND MARRIAGE IS
 YOUWILL UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING
DOROTHEA FELT HER HEART BEGINNING TO BEAT FASTER
 HAD HE THAT SORROWTOO
 BUT SHE FEARED TO SAY ANY WORD AND HE WENT ON IMMEDIATELY
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME NOW TO DO ANYTHINGTO TAKE ANY STEP WITHOUTCONSIDERING MY WIFES HAPPINESS
 THE THING THAT I MIGHT LIKE TO DO IF IWERE ALONE IS BECOME IMPOSSIBLE TO ME
 I CANT SEE HER MISERABLE
 SHEMARRIED ME WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT SHE WAS GOING INTO AND IT MIGHT HAVEBEEN BETTER FOR HER IF SHE HAD NOT MARRIED ME
I KNOW I KNOWYOU COULD NOT GIVE HER PAIN IF YOU WERE NOT OBLIGED TODO IT SAID DOROTHEA WITH KEEN MEMORY OF HER OWN LIFE
AND SHE HAS SET HER MIND AGAINST STAYING
 SHE WISHES TO GO
 THETROUBLES SHE HAS HAD HERE HAVE WEARIED HER SAID LYDGATE BREAKING OFFAGAIN LEST HE SHOULD SAY TOO MUCH
BUT WHEN SHE SAW THE GOOD THAT MIGHT COME OF STAYING SAID DOROTHEAREMONSTRANTLY LOOKING AT LYDGATE AS IF HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE REASONSWHICH HAD JUST BEEN CONSIDERED
 HE DID NOT SPEAK IMMEDIATELY
SHE WOULD NOT SEE IT HE SAID AT LAST CURTLY FEELING AT FIRST THATTHIS STATEMENT MUST DO WITHOUT EXPLANATION
 AND INDEED I HAVE LOSTALL SPIRIT ABOUT CARRYING ON MY LIFE HERE
 HE PAUSED A MOMENT ANDTHEN FOLLOWING THE IMPULSE TO LET DOROTHEA SEE DEEPER INTO THEDIFFICULTY OF HIS LIFE HE SAID THE FACT IS THIS TROUBLE HAS COMEUPON HER CONFUSEDLY
 WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK TO EACH OTHER ABOUTIT
 I AM NOT SURE WHAT IS IN HER MIND ABOUT IT SHE MAY FEAR THAT IHAVE REALLY DONE SOMETHING BASE
 IT IS MY FAULT I OUGHT TO BE MOREOPEN
 BUT I HAVE BEEN SUFFERING CRUELLY
MAY I GO AND SEE HER
 SAID DOROTHEA EAGERLY
 WOULD SHE ACCEPT MYSYMPATHY
 I WOULD TELL HER THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN BLAMABLE BEFORE ANYONES JUDGMENT BUT YOUR OWN
 I WOULD TELL HER THAT YOU SHALL BE CLEAREDIN EVERY FAIR MIND
 I WOULD CHEER HER HEART
 WILL YOU ASK HER IF I MAYGO TO SEE HER
 I DID SEE HER ONCE
I AM SURE YOU MAY SAID LYDGATE SEIZING THE PROPOSITION WITH SOMEHOPE
 SHE WOULD FEEL HONOREDCHEERED I THINK BY THE PROOF THAT YOUAT LEAST HAVE SOME RESPECT FOR ME
 I WILL NOT SPEAK TO HER ABOUT YOURCOMINGTHAT SHE MAY NOT CONNECT IT WITH MY WISHES AT ALL
 I KNOW VERYWELL THAT I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE LEFT ANYTHING TO BE TOLD HER BY OTHERSBUTHE BROKE OFF AND THERE WAS A MOMENTS SILENCE
 DOROTHEA REFRAINED FROMSAYING WHAT WAS IN HER MINDHOW WELL SHE KNEW THAT THERE MIGHT BEINVISIBLE BARRIERS TO SPEECH BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE
 THIS WAS A POINTON WHICH EVEN SYMPATHY MIGHT MAKE A WOUND
 SHE RETURNED TO THE MOREOUTWARD ASPECT OF LYDGATES POSITION SAYING CHEERFULLYAND IF MRS
 LYDGATE KNEW THAT THERE WERE FRIENDS WHO WOULD BELIEVE INYOU AND SUPPORT YOU SHE MIGHT THEN BE GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD STAY INYOUR PLACE AND RECOVER YOUR HOPESAND DO WHAT YOU MEANT TO DO
 PERHAPSTHEN YOU WOULD SEE THAT IT WAS RIGHT TO AGREE WITH WHAT I PROPOSEDABOUT YOUR CONTINUING AT THE HOSPITAL
 SURELY YOU WOULD IF YOU STILLHAVE FAITH IN IT AS A MEANS OF MAKING YOUR KNOWLEDGE USEFUL
LYDGATE DID NOT ANSWER AND SHE SAW THAT HE WAS DEBATING WITH HIMSELF
YOU NEED NOT DECIDE IMMEDIATELY SHE SAID GENTLY
 A FEW DAYS HENCEIT WILL BE EARLY ENOUGH FOR ME TO SEND MY ANSWER TO MR
 BULSTRODE
LYDGATE STILL WAITED BUT AT LAST TURNED TO SPEAK IN HIS MOST DECISIVETONES
NO I PREFER THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO INTERVAL LEFT FOR WAVERING
 I AMNO LONGER SURE ENOUGH OF MYSELFI MEAN OF WHAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FORME TO DO UNDER THE CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY LIFE
 IT WOULD BEDISHONORABLE TO LET OTHERS ENGAGE THEMSELVES TO ANYTHING SERIOUS INDEPENDENCE ON ME
 I MIGHT BE OBLIGED TO GO AWAY AFTER ALL I SEE LITTLECHANCE OF ANYTHING ELSE
 THE WHOLE THING IS TOO PROBLEMATIC I CANNOTCONSENT TO BE THE CAUSE OF YOUR GOODNESS BEING WASTED
 NOLET THE NEWHOSPITAL BE JOINED WITH THE OLD INFIRMARY AND EVERYTHING GO ON AS ITMIGHT HAVE DONE IF I HAD NEVER COME
 I HAVE KEPT A VALUABLE REGISTERSINCE I HAVE BEEN THERE I SHALL SEND IT TO A MAN WHO WILL MAKE USE OFIT HE ENDED BITTERLY
 I CAN THINK OF NOTHING FOR A LONG WHILE BUTGETTING AN INCOME
IT HURTS ME VERY MUCH TO HEAR YOU SPEAK SO HOPELESSLY SAID DOROTHEA
IT WOULD BE A HAPPINESS TO YOUR FRIENDS WHO BELIEVE IN YOUR FUTUREIN YOUR POWER TO DO GREAT THINGS IF YOU WOULD LET THEM SAVE YOU FROMTHAT
 THINK HOW MUCH MONEY I HAVE IT WOULD BE LIKE TAKING A BURTHENFROM ME IF YOU TOOK SOME OF IT EVERY YEAR TILL YOU GOT FREE FROM THISFETTERING WANT OF INCOME
 WHY SHOULD NOT PEOPLE DO THESE THINGS
 IT ISSO DIFFICULT TO MAKE SHARES AT ALL EVEN
 THIS IS ONE WAY
GOD BLESS YOU MRS
 CASAUBON
 SAID LYDGATE RISING AS IF WITH THESAME IMPULSE THAT MADE HIS WORDS ENERGETIC AND RESTING HIS ARM ON THEBACK OF THE GREAT LEATHER CHAIR HE HAD BEEN SITTING IN
 IT IS GOODTHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE SUCH FEELINGS
 BUT I AM NOT THE MAN WHO OUGHT TOALLOW HIMSELF TO BENEFIT BY THEM
 I HAVE NOT GIVEN GUARANTEES ENOUGH
 IMUST NOT AT LEAST SINK INTO THE DEGRADATION OF BEING PENSIONED FOR WORKTHAT I NEVER ACHIEVED
 IT IS VERY CLEAR TO ME THAT I MUST NOT COUNT ONANYTHING ELSE THAN GETTING AWAY FROM MIDDLEMARCH AS SOON AS I CANMANAGE IT
 I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE FOR A LONG WHILE AT THE VERY BEST TOGET AN INCOME HERE ANDAND IT IS EASIER TO MAKE NECESSARY CHANGES IN ANEW PLACE
 I MUST DO AS OTHER MEN DO AND THINK WHAT WILL PLEASE THEWORLD AND BRING IN MONEY LOOK FOR A LITTLE OPENING IN THE LONDONCROWD AND PUSH MYSELF SET UP IN A WATERINGPLACE OR GO TO SOMESOUTHERN TOWN WHERE THERE ARE PLENTY OF IDLE ENGLISH AND GET MYSELFPUFFEDTHAT IS THE SORT OF SHELL I MUST CREEP INTO AND TRY TO KEEP MYSOUL ALIVE IN
NOW THAT IS NOT BRAVE SAID DOROTHEATO GIVE UP THE FIGHT
NO IT IS NOT BRAVE SAID LYDGATE BUT IF A MAN IS AFRAID OFCREEPING PARALYSIS
 THEN IN ANOTHER TONE YET YOU HAVE MADE A GREATDIFFERENCE IN MY COURAGE BY BELIEVING IN ME
 EVERYTHING SEEMS MOREBEARABLE SINCE I HAVE TALKED TO YOU AND IF YOU CAN CLEAR ME IN A FEWOTHER MINDS ESPECIALLY IN FAREBROTHERS I SHALL BE DEEPLY GRATEFUL
THE POINT I WISH YOU NOT TO MENTION IS THE FACT OF DISOBEDIENCE TO MYORDERS
 THAT WOULD SOON GET DISTORTED
 AFTER ALL THERE IS NO EVIDENCEFOR ME BUT PEOPLES OPINION OF ME BEFOREHAND
 YOU CAN ONLY REPEAT MYOWN REPORT OF MYSELF
MR
 FAREBROTHER WILL BELIEVEOTHERS WILL BELIEVE SAID DOROTHEA
 ICAN SAY OF YOU WHAT WILL MAKE IT STUPIDITY TO SUPPOSE THAT YOU WOULD BEBRIBED TO DO A WICKEDNESS
I DONT KNOW SAID LYDGATE WITH SOMETHING LIKE A GROAN IN HIS VOICE
I HAVE NOT TAKEN A BRIBE YET
 BUT THERE IS A PALE SHADE OF BRIBERYWHICH IS SOMETIMES CALLED PROSPERITY
 YOU WILL DO ME ANOTHER GREATKINDNESS THEN AND COME TO SEE MY WIFE
YES I WILL
 I REMEMBER HOW PRETTY SHE IS SAID DOROTHEA INTO WHOSEMIND EVERY IMPRESSION ABOUT ROSAMOND HAD CUT DEEP
 I HOPE SHE WILLLIKE ME
AS LYDGATE RODE AWAY HE THOUGHT THIS YOUNG CREATURE HAS A HEARTLARGE ENOUGH FOR THE VIRGIN MARY
 SHE EVIDENTLY THINKS NOTHING OF HEROWN FUTURE AND WOULD PLEDGE AWAY HALF HER INCOME AT ONCE AS IF SHEWANTED NOTHING FOR HERSELF BUT A CHAIR TO SIT IN FROM WHICH SHE CANLOOK DOWN WITH THOSE CLEAR EYES AT THE POOR MORTALS WHO PRAY TO HER
SHE SEEMS TO HAVE WHAT I NEVER SAW IN ANY WOMAN BEFOREA FOUNTAIN OFFRIENDSHIP TOWARDS MENA MAN CAN MAKE A FRIEND OF HER
 CASAUBON MUSTHAVE RAISED SOME HEROIC HALLUCINATION IN HER
 I WONDER IF SHE COULDHAVE ANY OTHER SORT OF PASSION FOR A MAN
 LADISLAW
THERE WAS CERTAINLYAN UNUSUAL FEELING BETWEEN THEM
 AND CASAUBON MUST HAVE HAD A NOTION OFIT
 WELLHER LOVE MIGHT HELP A MAN MORE THAN HER MONEY
DOROTHEA ON HER SIDE HAD IMMEDIATELY FORMED A PLAN OF RELIEVING LYDGATEFROM HIS OBLIGATION TO BULSTRODE WHICH SHE FELT SURE WAS A PARTTHOUGH SMALL OF THE GALLING PRESSURE HE HAD TO BEAR
 SHE SAT DOWN ATONCE UNDER THE INSPIRATION OF THEIR INTERVIEW AND WROTE A BRIEF NOTEIN WHICH SHE PLEADED THAT SHE HAD MORE CLAIM THAN MR
 BULSTRODE HAD TOTHE SATISFACTION OF PROVIDING THE MONEY WHICH HAD BEEN SERVICEABLE TOLYDGATETHAT IT WOULD BE UNKIND IN LYDGATE NOT TO GRANT HER THEPOSITION OF BEING HIS HELPER IN THIS SMALL MATTER THE FAVOR BEINGENTIRELY TO HER WHO HAD SO LITTLE THAT WAS PLAINLY MARKED OUT FOR HERTO DO WITH HER SUPERFLUOUS MONEY
 HE MIGHT CALL HER A CREDITOR OR BYANY OTHER NAME IF IT DID BUT IMPLY THAT HE GRANTED HER REQUEST
 SHEENCLOSED A CHECK FOR A THOUSAND POUNDS AND DETERMINED TO TAKE THELETTER WITH HER THE NEXT DAY WHEN SHE WENT TO SEE ROSAMOND
CHAPTER LXXVII
AND THUS THY FALL HATH LEFT A KIND OF BLOTTO MARK THE FULLFRAUGHT MAN AND BEST INDUEDWITH SOME SUSPICION
HENRY V
THE NEXT DAY LYDGATE HAD TO GO TO BRASSING AND TOLD ROSAMOND THAT HESHOULD BE AWAY UNTIL THE EVENING
 OF LATE SHE HAD NEVER GONE BEYOND HEROWN HOUSE AND GARDEN EXCEPT TO CHURCH AND ONCE TO SEE HER PAPA TOWHOM SHE SAID IF TERTIUS GOES AWAY YOU WILL HELP US TO MOVE WILLYOU NOT PAPA
 I SUPPOSE WE SHALL HAVE VERY LITTLE MONEY
 I AM SURE IHOPE SOME ONE WILL HELP US
 AND MR
 VINCY HAD SAID YES CHILD IDONT MIND A HUNDRED OR TWO
 I CAN SEE THE END OF THAT
 WITH THESEEXCEPTIONS SHE HAD SAT AT HOME IN LANGUID MELANCHOLY AND SUSPENSEFIXING HER MIND ON WILL LADISLAWS COMING AS THE ONE POINT OF HOPE ANDINTEREST AND ASSOCIATING THIS WITH SOME NEW URGENCY ON LYDGATE TO MAKEIMMEDIATE ARRANGEMENTS FOR LEAVING MIDDLEMARCH AND GOING TO LONDONTILL SHE FELT ASSURED THAT THE COMING WOULD BE A POTENT CAUSE OF THEGOING WITHOUT AT ALL SEEING HOW
 THIS WAY OF ESTABLISHING SEQUENCES ISTOO COMMON TO BE FAIRLY REGARDED AS A PECULIAR FOLLY IN ROSAMOND
 ANDIT IS PRECISELY THIS SORT OF SEQUENCE WHICH CAUSES THE GREATEST SHOCKWHEN IT IS SUNDERED FOR TO SEE HOW AN EFFECT MAY BE PRODUCED IS OFTENTO SEE POSSIBLE MISSINGS AND CHECKS BUT TO SEE NOTHING EXCEPT THEDESIRABLE CAUSE AND CLOSE UPON IT THE DESIRABLE EFFECT RIDS US OFDOUBT AND MAKES OUR MINDS STRONGLY INTUITIVE
 THAT WAS THE PROCESSGOING ON IN POOR ROSAMOND WHILE SHE ARRANGED ALL OBJECTS AROUND HERWITH THE SAME NICETY AS EVER ONLY WITH MORE SLOWNESSOR SAT DOWN TOTHE PIANO MEANING TO PLAY AND THEN DESISTING YET LINGERING ON THEMUSIC STOOL WITH HER WHITE FINGERS SUSPENDED ON THE WOODEN FRONT ANDLOOKING BEFORE HER IN DREAMY ENNUI
 HER MELANCHOLY HAD BECOME SO MARKEDTHAT LYDGATE FELT A STRANGE TIMIDITY BEFORE IT AS A PERPETUAL SILENTREPROACH AND THE STRONG MAN MASTERED BY HIS KEEN SENSIBILITIESTOWARDS THIS FAIR FRAGILE CREATURE WHOSE LIFE HE SEEMED SOMEHOW TO HAVEBRUISED SHRANK FROM HER LOOK AND SOMETIMES STARTED AT HER APPROACHFEAR OF HER AND FEAR FOR HER RUSHING IN ONLY THE MORE FORCIBLY AFTER ITHAD BEEN MOMENTARILY EXPELLED BY EXASPERATION
BUT THIS MORNING ROSAMOND DESCENDED FROM HER ROOM UPSTAIRSWHERE SHESOMETIMES SAT THE WHOLE DAY WHEN LYDGATE WAS OUTEQUIPPED FOR A WALK INTHE TOWN
 SHE HAD A LETTER TO POSTA LETTER ADDRESSED TO MR
 LADISLAWAND WRITTEN WITH CHARMING DISCRETION BUT INTENDED TO HASTEN HISARRIVAL BY A HINT OF TROUBLE
 THE SERVANTMAID THEIR SOLEHOUSESERVANT NOW NOTICED HER COMING DOWNSTAIRS IN HER WALKING DRESSAND THOUGHT THERE NEVER DID ANYBODY LOOK SO PRETTY IN A BONNET POORTHING
MEANWHILE DOROTHEAS MIND WAS FILLED WITH HER PROJECT OF GOING TOROSAMOND AND WITH THE MANY THOUGHTS BOTH OF THE PAST AND THE PROBABLEFUTURE WHICH GATHERED ROUND THE IDEA OF THAT VISIT
 UNTIL YESTERDAYWHEN LYDGATE HAD OPENED TO HER A GLIMPSE OF SOME TROUBLE IN HIS MARRIEDLIFE THE IMAGE OF MRS
 LYDGATE HAD ALWAYS BEEN ASSOCIATED FOR HER WITHTHAT OF WILL LADISLAW
 EVEN IN HER MOST UNEASY MOMENTSEVEN WHEN SHEHAD BEEN AGITATED BY MRS
 CADWALLADERS PAINFULLY GRAPHIC REPORT OFGOSSIPHER EFFORT NAY HER STRONGEST IMPULSIVE PROMPTING HAD BEENTOWARDS THE VINDICATION OF WILL FROM ANY SULLYING SURMISES AND WHENIN HER MEETING WITH HIM AFTERWARDS SHE HAD AT FIRST INTERPRETED HISWORDS AS A PROBABLE ALLUSION TO A FEELING TOWARDS MRS
 LYDGATE WHICH HEWAS DETERMINED TO CUT HIMSELF OFF FROM INDULGING SHE HAD HAD A QUICKSAD EXCUSING VISION OF THE CHARM THERE MIGHT BE IN HIS CONSTANTOPPORTUNITIES OF COMPANIONSHIP WITH THAT FAIR CREATURE WHO MOST LIKELYSHARED HIS OTHER TASTES AS SHE EVIDENTLY DID HIS DELIGHT IN MUSIC
 BUTTHERE HAD FOLLOWED HIS PARTING WORDSTHE FEW PASSIONATE WORDS IN WHICHHE HAD IMPLIED THAT SHE HERSELF WAS THE OBJECT OF WHOM HIS LOVE HELDHIM IN DREAD THAT IT WAS HIS LOVE FOR HER ONLY WHICH HE WAS RESOLVEDNOT TO DECLARE BUT TO CARRY AWAY INTO BANISHMENT
 FROM THE TIME OF THATPARTING DOROTHEA BELIEVING IN WILLS LOVE FOR HER BELIEVING WITH APROUD DELIGHT IN HIS DELICATE SENSE OF HONOR AND HIS DETERMINATION THATNO ONE SHOULD IMPEACH HIM JUSTLY FELT HER HEART QUITE AT REST AS TOTHE REGARD HE MIGHT HAVE FOR MRS
 LYDGATE
 SHE WAS SURE THAT THE REGARDWAS BLAMELESS
THERE ARE NATURES IN WHICH IF THEY LOVE US WE ARE CONSCIOUS OF HAVINGA SORT OF BAPTISM AND CONSECRATION THEY BIND US OVER TO RECTITUDE ANDPURITY BY THEIR PURE BELIEF ABOUT US AND OUR SINS BECOME THAT WORSTKIND OF SACRILEGE WHICH TEARS DOWN THE INVISIBLE ALTAR OF TRUST
 IFYOU ARE NOT GOOD NONE IS GOODTHOSE LITTLE WORDS MAY GIVE A TERRIFICMEANING TO RESPONSIBILITY MAY HOLD A VITRIOLIC INTENSITY FOR REMORSE
DOROTHEAS NATURE WAS OF THAT KIND HER OWN PASSIONATE FAULTS LAY ALONGTHE EASILY COUNTED OPEN CHANNELS OF HER ARDENT CHARACTER AND WHILE SHEWAS FULL OF PITY FOR THE VISIBLE MISTAKES OF OTHERS SHE HAD NOT YETANY MATERIAL WITHIN HER EXPERIENCE FOR SUBTLE CONSTRUCTIONS ANDSUSPICIONS OF HIDDEN WRONG
 BUT THAT SIMPLICITY OF HERS HOLDING UP ANIDEAL FOR OTHERS IN HER BELIEVING CONCEPTION OF THEM WAS ONE OF THEGREAT POWERS OF HER WOMANHOOD
 AND IT HAD FROM THE FIRST ACTED STRONGLYON WILL LADISLAW
 HE FELT WHEN HE PARTED FROM HER THAT THE BRIEFWORDS BY WHICH HE HAD TRIED TO CONVEY TO HER HIS FEELING ABOUT HERSELFAND THE DIVISION WHICH HER FORTUNE MADE BETWEEN THEM WOULD ONLY PROFITBY THEIR BREVITY WHEN DOROTHEA HAD TO INTERPRET THEM HE FELT THAT INHER MIND HE HAD FOUND HIS HIGHEST ESTIMATE
AND HE WAS RIGHT THERE
 IN THE MONTHS SINCE THEIR PARTING DOROTHEA HADFELT A DELICIOUS THOUGH SAD REPOSE IN THEIR RELATION TO EACH OTHER ASONE WHICH WAS INWARDLY WHOLE AND WITHOUT BLEMISH
 SHE HAD AN ACTIVEFORCE OF ANTAGONISM WITHIN HER WHEN THE ANTAGONISM TURNED ON THEDEFENCE EITHER OF PLANS OR PERSONS THAT SHE BELIEVED IN AND THE WRONGSWHICH SHE FELT THAT WILL HAD RECEIVED FROM HER HUSBAND AND THEEXTERNAL CONDITIONS WHICH TO OTHERS WERE GROUNDS FOR SLIGHTING HIMONLY GAVE THE MORE TENACITY TO HER AFFECTION AND ADMIRING JUDGMENT
 ANDNOW WITH THE DISCLOSURES ABOUT BULSTRODE HAD COME ANOTHER FACTAFFECTING WILLS SOCIAL POSITION WHICH ROUSED AFRESH DOROTHEAS INWARDRESISTANCE TO WHAT WAS SAID ABOUT HIM IN THAT PART OF HER WORLD WHICHLAY WITHIN PARK PALINGS
YOUNG LADISLAW THE GRANDSON OF A THIEVING JEW PAWNBROKER WAS A PHRASEWHICH HAD ENTERED EMPHATICALLY INTO THE DIALOGUES ABOUT THE BULSTRODEBUSINESS AT LOWICK TIPTON AND FRESHITT AND WAS A WORSE KIND OFPLACARD ON POOR WILLS BACK THAN THE ITALIAN WITH WHITE MICE
 UPRIGHTSIR JAMES CHETTAM WAS CONVINCED THAT HIS OWN SATISFACTION WAS RIGHTEOUSWHEN HE THOUGHT WITH SOME COMPLACENCY THAT HERE WAS AN ADDED LEAGUE TOTHAT MOUNTAINOUS DISTANCE BETWEEN LADISLAW AND DOROTHEA WHICH ENABLEDHIM TO DISMISS ANY ANXIETY IN THAT DIRECTION AS TOO ABSURD
 AND PERHAPSTHERE HAD BEEN SOME PLEASURE IN POINTING MR
 BROOKES ATTENTION TO THISUGLY BIT OF LADISLAWS GENEALOGY AS A FRESH CANDLE FOR HIM TO SEE HISOWN FOLLY BY
 DOROTHEA HAD OBSERVED THE ANIMUS WITH WHICH WILLS PARTIN THE PAINFUL STORY HAD BEEN RECALLED MORE THAN ONCE BUT SHE HADUTTERED NO WORD BEING CHECKED NOW AS SHE HAD NOT BEEN FORMERLY INSPEAKING OF WILL BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A DEEPER RELATION BETWEENTHEM WHICH MUST ALWAYS REMAIN IN CONSECRATED SECRECY
 BUT HER SILENCESHROUDED HER RESISTANT EMOTION INTO A MORE THOROUGH GLOW AND THISMISFORTUNE IN WILLS LOT WHICH IT SEEMED OTHERS WERE WISHING TO FLINGAT HIS BACK AS AN OPPROBRIUM ONLY GAVE SOMETHING MORE OF ENTHUSIASM TOHER CLINGING THOUGHT
SHE ENTERTAINED NO VISIONS OF THEIR EVER COMING INTO NEARER UNION ANDYET SHE HAD TAKEN NO POSTURE OF RENUNCIATION
 SHE HAD ACCEPTED HERWHOLE RELATION TO WILL VERY SIMPLY AS PART OF HER MARRIAGE SORROWS ANDWOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT VERY SINFUL IN HER TO KEEP UP AN INWARD WAILBECAUSE SHE WAS NOT COMPLETELY HAPPY BEING RATHER DISPOSED TO DWELL ONTHE SUPERFLUITIES OF HER LOT
 SHE COULD BEAR THAT THE CHIEF PLEASURESOF HER TENDERNESS SHOULD LIE IN MEMORY AND THE IDEA OF MARRIAGE CAMETO HER SOLELY AS A REPULSIVE PROPOSITION FROM SOME SUITOR OF WHOM SHEAT PRESENT KNEW NOTHING BUT WHOSE MERITS AS SEEN BY HER FRIENDSWOULD BE A SOURCE OF TORMENT TO HERSOMEBODY WHO WILL MANAGE YOURPROPERTY FOR YOU MY DEAR WAS MR
 BROOKES ATTRACTIVE SUGGESTION OFSUITABLE CHARACTERISTICS
 I SHOULD LIKE TO MANAGE IT MYSELF IF I KNEWWHAT TO DO WITH IT SAID DOROTHEA
 NOSHE ADHERED TO HER DECLARATIONTHAT SHE WOULD NEVER BE MARRIED AGAIN AND IN THE LONG VALLEY OF HERLIFE WHICH LOOKED SO FLAT AND EMPTY OF WAYMARKS GUIDANCE WOULD COME ASSHE WALKED ALONG THE ROAD AND SAW HER FELLOWPASSENGERS BY THE WAY
THIS HABITUAL STATE OF FEELING ABOUT WILL LADISLAW HAD BEEN STRONG INALL HER WAKING HOURS SINCE SHE HAD PROPOSED TO PAY A VISIT TO MRS
LYDGATE MAKING A SORT OF BACKGROUND AGAINST WHICH SHE SAW ROSAMONDSFIGURE PRESENTED TO HER WITHOUT HINDRANCES TO HER INTEREST ANDCOMPASSION
 THERE WAS EVIDENTLY SOME MENTAL SEPARATION SOME BARRIER TOCOMPLETE CONFIDENCE WHICH HAD ARISEN BETWEEN THIS WIFE AND THE HUSBANDWHO HAD YET MADE HER HAPPINESS A LAW TO HIM
 THAT WAS A TROUBLE WHICHNO THIRD PERSON MUST DIRECTLY TOUCH
 BUT DOROTHEA THOUGHT WITH DEEPPITY OF THE LONELINESS WHICH MUST HAVE COME UPON ROSAMOND FROM THESUSPICIONS CAST ON HER HUSBAND AND THERE WOULD SURELY BE HELP IN THEMANIFESTATION OF RESPECT FOR LYDGATE AND SYMPATHY WITH HER
I SHALL TALK TO HER ABOUT HER HUSBAND THOUGHT DOROTHEA AS SHE WASBEING DRIVEN TOWARDS THE TOWN
 THE CLEAR SPRING MORNING THE SCENT OFTHE MOIST EARTH THE FRESH LEAVES JUST SHOWING THEIR CREASEDUP WEALTHOF GREENERY FROM OUT THEIR HALFOPENED SHEATHS SEEMED PART OF THECHEERFULNESS SHE WAS FEELING FROM A LONG CONVERSATION WITH MR
FAREBROTHER WHO HAD JOYFULLY ACCEPTED THE JUSTIFYING EXPLANATION OFLYDGATES CONDUCT
 I SHALL TAKE MRS
 LYDGATE GOOD NEWS AND PERHAPSSHE WILL LIKE TO TALK TO ME AND MAKE A FRIEND OF ME
DOROTHEA HAD ANOTHER ERRAND IN LOWICK GATE IT WAS ABOUT A NEWFINETONED BELL FOR THE SCHOOLHOUSE AND AS SHE HAD TO GET OUT OF HERCARRIAGE VERY NEAR TO LYDGATES SHE WALKED THITHER ACROSS THE STREETHAVING TOLD THE COACHMAN TO WAIT FOR SOME PACKAGES
 THE STREET DOOR WASOPEN AND THE SERVANT WAS TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY OF LOOKING OUT AT THECARRIAGE WHICH WAS PAUSING WITHIN SIGHT WHEN IT BECAME APPARENT TO HERTHAT THE LADY WHO BELONGED TO IT WAS COMING TOWARDS HER
IS MRS
 LYDGATE AT HOME
 SAID DOROTHEA
IM NOT SURE MY LADY ILL SEE IF YOULL PLEASE TO WALK IN SAIDMARTHA A LITTLE CONFUSED ON THE SCORE OF HER KITCHEN APRON BUTCOLLECTED ENOUGH TO BE SURE THAT MUM WAS NOT THE RIGHT TITLE FOR THISQUEENLY YOUNG WIDOW WITH A CARRIAGE AND PAIR
 WILL YOU PLEASE TO WALKIN AND ILL GO AND SEE
SAY THAT I AM MRS
 CASAUBON SAID DOROTHEA AS MARTHA MOVED FORWARDINTENDING TO SHOW HER INTO THE DRAWINGROOM AND THEN TO GO UPSTAIRS TOSEE IF ROSAMOND HAD RETURNED FROM HER WALK
THEY CROSSED THE BROADER PART OF THE ENTRANCEHALL AND TURNED UP THEPASSAGE WHICH LED TO THE GARDEN
 THE DRAWINGROOM DOOR WAS UNLATCHEDAND MARTHA PUSHING IT WITHOUT LOOKING INTO THE ROOM WAITED FOR MRS
CASAUBON TO ENTER AND THEN TURNED AWAY THE DOOR HAVING SWUNG OPEN ANDSWUNG BACK AGAIN WITHOUT NOISE
DOROTHEA HAD LESS OF OUTWARD VISION THAN USUAL THIS MORNING BEINGFILLED WITH IMAGES OF THINGS AS THEY HAD BEEN AND WERE GOING TO BE
 SHEFOUND HERSELF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR WITHOUT SEEING ANYTHINGREMARKABLE BUT IMMEDIATELY SHE HEARD A VOICE SPEAKING IN LOW TONESWHICH STARTLED HER AS WITH A SENSE OF DREAMING IN DAYLIGHT ANDADVANCING UNCONSCIOUSLY A STEP OR TWO BEYOND THE PROJECTING SLAB OF ABOOKCASE SHE SAW IN THE TERRIBLE ILLUMINATION OF A CERTAINTY WHICHFILLED UP ALL OUTLINES SOMETHING WHICH MADE HER PAUSE MOTIONLESSWITHOUT SELFPOSSESSION ENOUGH TO SPEAK
SEATED WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS HER ON A SOFA WHICH STOOD AGAINST THE WALLON A LINE WITH THE DOOR BY WHICH SHE HAD ENTERED SHE SAW WILLLADISLAW CLOSE BY HIM AND TURNED TOWARDS HIM WITH A FLUSHEDTEARFULNESS WHICH GAVE A NEW BRILLIANCY TO HER FACE SAT ROSAMOND HERBONNET HANGING BACK WHILE WILL LEANING TOWARDS HER CLASPED BOTH HERUPRAISED HANDS IN HIS AND SPOKE WITH LOWTONED FERVOR
ROSAMOND IN HER AGITATED ABSORPTION HAD NOT NOTICED THE SILENTLYADVANCING FIGURE BUT WHEN DOROTHEA AFTER THE FIRST IMMEASURABLEINSTANT OF THIS VISION MOVED CONFUSEDLY BACKWARD AND FOUND HERSELFIMPEDED BY SOME PIECE OF FURNITURE ROSAMOND WAS SUDDENLY AWARE OF HERPRESENCE AND WITH A SPASMODIC MOVEMENT SNATCHED AWAY HER HANDS ANDROSE LOOKING AT DOROTHEA WHO WAS NECESSARILY ARRESTED
 WILL LADISLAWSTARTING UP LOOKED ROUND ALSO AND MEETING DOROTHEAS EYES WITH A NEWLIGHTNING IN THEM SEEMED CHANGING TO MARBLE
 BUT SHE IMMEDIATELYTURNED THEM AWAY FROM HIM TO ROSAMOND AND SAID IN A FIRM VOICEEXCUSE ME MRS
 LYDGATE THE SERVANT DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU WERE HERE
I CALLED TO DELIVER AN IMPORTANT LETTER FOR MR
 LYDGATE WHICH I WISHEDTO PUT INTO YOUR OWN HANDS
SHE LAID DOWN THE LETTER ON THE SMALL TABLE WHICH HAD CHECKED HERRETREAT AND THEN INCLUDING ROSAMOND AND WILL IN ONE DISTANT GLANCE ANDBOW SHE WENT QUICKLY OUT OF THE ROOM MEETING IN THE PASSAGE THESURPRISED MARTHA WHO SAID SHE WAS SORRY THE MISTRESS WAS NOT AT HOMEAND THEN SHOWED THE STRANGE LADY OUT WITH AN INWARD REFLECTION THATGRAND PEOPLE WERE PROBABLY MORE IMPATIENT THAN OTHERS
DOROTHEA WALKED ACROSS THE STREET WITH HER MOST ELASTIC STEP AND WASQUICKLY IN HER CARRIAGE AGAIN
DRIVE ON TO FRESHITT HALL SHE SAID TO THE COACHMAN AND ANY ONELOOKING AT HER MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT THOUGH SHE WAS PALER THAN USUALSHE WAS NEVER ANIMATED BY A MORE SELFPOSSESSED ENERGY
 AND THAT WASREALLY HER EXPERIENCE
 IT WAS AS IF SHE HAD DRUNK A GREAT DRAUGHT OFSCORN THAT STIMULATED HER BEYOND THE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO OTHER FEELINGS
SHE HAD SEEN SOMETHING SO FAR BELOW HER BELIEF THAT HER EMOTIONSRUSHED BACK FROM IT AND MADE AN EXCITED THRONG WITHOUT AN OBJECT
 SHENEEDED SOMETHING ACTIVE TO TURN HER EXCITEMENT OUT UPON
 SHE FELT POWERTO WALK AND WORK FOR A DAY WITHOUT MEAT OR DRINK
 AND SHE WOULD CARRYOUT THE PURPOSE WITH WHICH SHE HAD STARTED IN THE MORNING OF GOING TOFRESHITT AND TIPTON TO TELL SIR JAMES AND HER UNCLE ALL THAT SHE WISHEDTHEM TO KNOW ABOUT LYDGATE WHOSE MARRIED LONELINESS UNDER HIS TRIALNOW PRESENTED ITSELF TO HER WITH NEW SIGNIFICANCE AND MADE HER MOREARDENT IN READINESS TO BE HIS CHAMPION
 SHE HAD NEVER FELT ANYTHINGLIKE THIS TRIUMPHANT POWER OF INDIGNATION IN THE STRUGGLE OF HERMARRIED LIFE IN WHICH THERE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A QUICKLY SUBDUING PANGAND SHE TOOK IT AS A SIGN OF NEW STRENGTH
DODO HOW VERY BRIGHT YOUR EYES ARE
 SAID CELIA WHEN SIR JAMES WASGONE OUT OF THE ROOM
 AND YOU DONT SEE ANYTHING YOU LOOK AT ARTHUROR ANYTHING
 YOU ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING UNCOMFORTABLE I KNOW
 IS ITALL ABOUT MR
 LYDGATE OR HAS SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED
 CELIA HAD BEENUSED TO WATCH HER SISTER WITH EXPECTATION
YES DEAR A GREAT MANY THINGS HAVE HAPPENED SAID DODO IN HER FULLTONES
I WONDER WHAT SAID CELIA FOLDING HER ARMS COZILY AND LEANINGFORWARD UPON THEM
OH ALL THE TROUBLES OF ALL PEOPLE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH SAIDDOROTHEA LIFTING HER ARMS TO THE BACK OF HER HEAD
DEAR ME DODO ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE A SCHEME FOR THEM
 SAID CELIA ALITTLE UNEASY AT THIS HAMLETLIKE RAVING
BUT SIR JAMES CAME IN AGAIN READY TO ACCOMPANY DOROTHEA TO THE GRANGEAND SHE FINISHED HER EXPEDITION WELL NOT SWERVING IN HER RESOLUTIONUNTIL SHE DESCENDED AT HER OWN DOOR
CHAPTER LXXVIII
WOULD IT WERE YESTERDAY AND I I THE GRAVEWITH HER SWEET FAITH ABOVE FOR MONUMENT
ROSAMOND AND WILL STOOD MOTIONLESSTHEY DID NOT KNOW HOW LONGHELOOKING TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE DOROTHEA HAD STOOD AND SHE LOOKINGTOWARDS HIM WITH DOUBT
 IT SEEMED AN ENDLESS TIME TO ROSAMOND IN WHOSEINMOST SOUL THERE WAS HARDLY SO MUCH ANNOYANCE AS GRATIFICATION FROMWHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED
 SHALLOW NATURES DREAM OF AN EASY SWAY OVER THEEMOTIONS OF OTHERS TRUSTING IMPLICITLY IN THEIR OWN PETTY MAGIC TOTURN THE DEEPEST STREAMS AND CONFIDENT BY PRETTY GESTURES ANDREMARKS OF MAKING THE THING THAT IS NOT AS THOUGH IT WERE
 SHE KNEWTHAT WILL HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE BLOW BUT SHE HAD BEEN LITTLE USED TOIMAGINING OTHER PEOPLES STATES OF MIND EXCEPT AS A MATERIAL CUT INTOSHAPE BY HER OWN WISHES AND SHE BELIEVED IN HER OWN POWER TO SOOTHE ORSUBDUE
 EVEN TERTIUS THAT MOST PERVERSE OF MEN WAS ALWAYS SUBDUED INTHE LONGRUN EVENTS HAD BEEN OBSTINATE BUT STILL ROSAMOND WOULD HAVESAID NOW AS SHE DID BEFORE HER MARRIAGE THAT SHE NEVER GAVE UP WHATSHE HAD SET HER MIND ON
SHE PUT OUT HER ARM AND LAID THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS ON WILLSCOATSLEEVE
DONT TOUCH ME
 HE SAID WITH AN UTTERANCE LIKE THE CUT OF A LASHDARTING FROM HER AND CHANGING FROM PINK TO WHITE AND BACK AGAIN AS IFHIS WHOLE FRAME WERE TINGLING WITH THE PAIN OF THE STING
 HE WHEELEDROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM AND STOOD OPPOSITE TO HER WITH THETIPS OF HIS FINGERS IN HIS POCKETS AND HIS HEAD THROWN BACK LOOKINGFIERCELY NOT AT ROSAMOND BUT AT A POINT A FEW INCHES AWAY FROM HER
SHE WAS KEENLY OFFENDED BUT THE SIGNS SHE MADE OF THIS WERE SUCH ASONLY LYDGATE WAS USED TO INTERPRET
 SHE BECAME SUDDENLY QUIET ANDSEATED HERSELF UNTYING HER HANGING BONNET AND LAYING IT DOWN WITH HERSHAWL
 HER LITTLE HANDS WHICH SHE FOLDED BEFORE HER WERE VERY COLD
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFER FOR WILL IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO HAVE TAKENUP HIS HAT AND GONE AWAY BUT HE HAD FELT NO IMPULSE TO DO THIS ON THECONTRARY HE HAD A HORRIBLE INCLINATION TO STAY AND SHATTER ROSAMONDWITH HIS ANGER
 IT SEEMED AS IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAR THE FATALITY SHE HADDRAWN DOWN ON HIM WITHOUT VENTING HIS FURY AS IT WOULD BE TO A PANTHERTO BEAR THE JAVELINWOUND WITHOUT SPRINGING AND BITING
 AND YETHOWCOULD HE TELL A WOMAN THAT HE WAS READY TO CURSE HER
 HE WAS FUMINGUNDER A REPRESSIVE LAW WHICH HE WAS FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HE WASDANGEROUSLY POISED AND ROSAMONDS VOICE NOW BROUGHT THE DECISIVEVIBRATION
 IN FLUTELIKE TONES OF SARCASM SHE SAIDYOU CAN EASILY GO AFTER MRS
 CASAUBON AND EXPLAIN YOUR PREFERENCE
GO AFTER HER
 HE BURST OUT WITH A SHARP EDGE IN HIS VOICE
 DO YOUTHINK SHE WOULD TURN TO LOOK AT ME OR VALUE ANY WORD I EVER UTTERED TOHER AGAIN AT MORE THAN A DIRTY FEATHER
EXPLAIN
 HOW CAN A MAN EXPLAINAT THE EXPENSE OF A WOMAN
YOU CAN TELL HER WHAT YOU PLEASE SAID ROSAMOND WITH MORE TREMOR
DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE WOULD LIKE ME BETTER FOR SACRIFICING YOU
 SHE ISNOT A WOMAN TO BE FLATTERED BECAUSE I MADE MYSELF DESPICABLETO BELIEVETHAT I MUST BE TRUE TO HER BECAUSE I WAS A DASTARD TO YOU
HE BEGAN TO MOVE ABOUT WITH THE RESTLESSNESS OF A WILD ANIMAL THAT SEESPREY BUT CANNOT REACH IT
 PRESENTLY HE BURST OUT AGAINI HAD NO HOPE BEFORENOT MUCHOF ANYTHING BETTER TO COME
 BUT I HADONE CERTAINTYTHAT SHE BELIEVED IN ME
 WHATEVER PEOPLE HAD SAID OR DONEABOUT ME SHE BELIEVED IN ME
THATS GONE
 SHELL NEVER AGAIN THINK MEANYTHING BUT A PALTRY PRETENCETOO NICE TO TAKE HEAVEN EXCEPT UPONFLATTERING CONDITIONS AND YET SELLING MYSELF FOR ANY DEVILS CHANGE BYTHE SLY
 SHELL THINK OF ME AS AN INCARNATE INSULT TO HER FROM THEFIRST MOMENT WEWILL STOPPED AS IF HE HAD FOUND HIMSELF GRASPING SOMETHING THAT MUSTNOT BE THROWN AND SHATTERED
 HE FOUND ANOTHER VENT FOR HIS RAGE BYSNATCHING UP ROSAMONDS WORDS AGAIN AS IF THEY WERE REPTILES TO BETHROTTLED AND FLUNG OFF
EXPLAIN
 TELL A MAN TO EXPLAIN HOW HE DROPPED INTO HELL
 EXPLAIN MYPREFERENCE
 I NEVER HAD A PREFERENCE FOR HER ANY MORE THAN I HAVE APREFERENCE FOR BREATHING
 NO OTHER WOMAN EXISTS BY THE SIDE OF HER
 IWOULD RATHER TOUCH HER HAND IF IT WERE DEAD THAN I WOULD TOUCH ANYOTHER WOMANS LIVING
ROSAMOND WHILE THESE POISONED WEAPONS WERE BEING HURLED AT HER WASALMOST LOSING THE SENSE OF HER IDENTITY AND SEEMED TO BE WAKING INTOSOME NEW TERRIBLE EXISTENCE
 SHE HAD NO SENSE OF CHILL RESOLUTEREPULSION OF RETICENT SELFJUSTIFICATION SUCH AS SHE HAD KNOWN UNDERLYDGATES MOST STORMY DISPLEASURE ALL HER SENSIBILITY WAS TURNED INTOA BEWILDERING NOVELTY OF PAIN SHE FELT A NEW TERRIFIED RECOIL UNDER ALASH NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE
 WHAT ANOTHER NATURE FELT IN OPPOSITIONTO HER OWN WAS BEING BURNT AND BITTEN INTO HER CONSCIOUSNESS
 WHEN WILLHAD CEASED TO SPEAK SHE HAD BECOME AN IMAGE OF SICKENED MISERY HERLIPS WERE PALE AND HER EYES HAD A TEARLESS DISMAY IN THEM
 IF IT HADBEEN TERTIUS WHO STOOD OPPOSITE TO HER THAT LOOK OF MISERY WOULD HAVEBEEN A PANG TO HIM AND HE WOULD HAVE SUNK BY HER SIDE TO COMFORT HERWITH THAT STRONGARMED COMFORT WHICH SHE HAD OFTEN HELD VERY CHEAP
LET IT BE FORGIVEN TO WILL THAT HE HAD NO SUCH MOVEMENT OF PITY
 HE HADFELT NO BOND BEFOREHAND TO THIS WOMAN WHO HAD SPOILED THE IDEALTREASURE OF HIS LIFE AND HE HELD HIMSELF BLAMELESS
 HE KNEW THAT HEWAS CRUEL BUT HE HAD NO RELENTING IN HIM YET
AFTER HE HAD DONE SPEAKING HE STILL MOVED ABOUT HALF IN ABSENCE OFMIND AND ROSAMOND SAT PERFECTLY STILL
 AT LENGTH WILL SEEMING TOBETHINK HIMSELF TOOK UP HIS HAT YET STOOD SOME MOMENTS IRRESOLUTE
 HEHAD SPOKEN TO HER IN A WAY THAT MADE A PHRASE OF COMMON POLITENESSDIFFICULT TO UTTER AND YET NOW THAT HE HAD COME TO THE POINT OF GOINGAWAY FROM HER WITHOUT FURTHER SPEECH HE SHRANK FROM IT AS A BRUTALITYHE FELT CHECKED AND STULTIFIED IN HIS ANGER
 HE WALKED TOWARDS THEMANTELPIECE AND LEANED HIS ARM ON IT AND WAITED IN SILENCE FORHEHARDLY KNEW WHAT
 THE VINDICTIVE FIRE WAS STILL BURNING IN HIM AND HECOULD UTTER NO WORD OF RETRACTATION BUT IT WAS NEVERTHELESS IN HISMIND THAT HAVING COME BACK TO THIS HEARTH WHERE HE HAD ENJOYED ACARESSING FRIENDSHIP HE HAD FOUND CALAMITY SEATED THEREHE HAD HADSUDDENLY REVEALED TO HIM A TROUBLE THAT LAY OUTSIDE THE HOME AS WELL ASWITHIN IT
 AND WHAT SEEMED A FOREBODING WAS PRESSING UPON HIM AS WITHSLOW PINCERSTHAT HIS LIFE MIGHT COME TO BE ENSLAVED BY THIS HELPLESSWOMAN WHO HAD THROWN HERSELF UPON HIM IN THE DREARY SADNESS OF HERHEART
 BUT HE WAS IN GLOOMY REBELLION AGAINST THE FACT THAT HIS QUICKAPPREHENSIVENESS FORESHADOWED TO HIM AND WHEN HIS EYES FELL ONROSAMONDS BLIGHTED FACE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS THE MORE PITIABLEOF THE TWO FOR PAIN MUST ENTER INTO ITS GLORIFIED LIFE OF MEMORYBEFORE IT CAN TURN INTO COMPASSION
AND SO THEY REMAINED FOR MANY MINUTES OPPOSITE EACH OTHER FAR APARTIN SILENCE WILLS FACE STILL POSSESSED BY A MUTE RAGE AND ROSAMONDSBY A MUTE MISERY
 THE POOR THING HAD NO FORCE TO FLING OUT ANY PASSIONIN RETURN THE TERRIBLE COLLAPSE OF THE ILLUSION TOWARDS WHICH ALL HERHOPE HAD BEEN STRAINED WAS A STROKE WHICH HAD TOO THOROUGHLY SHAKENHER HER LITTLE WORLD WAS IN RUINS AND SHE FELT HERSELF TOTTERING INTHE MIDST AS A LONELY BEWILDERED CONSCIOUSNESS
WILL WISHED THAT SHE WOULD SPEAK AND BRING SOME MITIGATING SHADOWACROSS HIS OWN CRUEL SPEECH WHICH SEEMED TO STAND STARING AT THEM BOTHIN MOCKERY OF ANY ATTEMPT AT REVIVED FELLOWSHIP
 BUT SHE SAID NOTHINGAND AT LAST WITH A DESPERATE EFFORT OVER HIMSELF HE ASKED SHALL ICOME IN AND SEE LYDGATE THIS EVENING
IF YOU LIKE ROSAMOND ANSWERED JUST AUDIBLY
AND THEN WILL WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE MARTHA NEVER KNOWING THAT HE HADBEEN IN
AFTER HE WAS GONE ROSAMOND TRIED TO GET UP FROM HER SEAT BUT FELLBACK FAINTING
 WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AGAIN SHE FELT TOO ILL TO MAKETHE EXERTION OF RISING TO RING THE BELL AND SHE REMAINED HELPLESSUNTIL THE GIRL SURPRISED AT HER LONG ABSENCE THOUGHT FOR THE FIRSTTIME OF LOOKING FOR HER IN ALL THE DOWNSTAIRS ROOMS
 ROSAMOND SAIDTHAT SHE HAD FELT SUDDENLY SICK AND FAINT AND WANTED TO BE HELPEDUPSTAIRS
 WHEN THERE SHE THREW HERSELF ON THE BED WITH HER CLOTHES ONAND LAY IN APPARENT TORPOR AS SHE HAD DONE ONCE BEFORE ON A MEMORABLEDAY OF GRIEF
LYDGATE CAME HOME EARLIER THAN HE HAD EXPECTED ABOUT HALFPAST FIVEAND FOUND HER THERE
 THE PERCEPTION THAT SHE WAS ILL THREW EVERY OTHERTHOUGHT INTO THE BACKGROUND
 WHEN HE FELT HER PULSE HER EYES RESTED ONHIM WITH MORE PERSISTENCE THAN THEY HAD DONE FOR A LONG WHILE AS IFSHE FELT SOME CONTENT THAT HE WAS THERE
 HE PERCEIVED THE DIFFERENCE INA MOMENT AND SEATING HIMSELF BY HER PUT HIS ARM GENTLY UNDER HER ANDBENDING OVER HER SAID MY POOR ROSAMOND
 HAS SOMETHING AGITATED YOU
CLINGING TO HIM SHE FELL INTO HYSTERICAL SOBBINGS AND CRIES AND FORTHE NEXT HOUR HE DID NOTHING BUT SOOTHE AND TEND HER
 HE IMAGINED THATDOROTHEA HAD BEEN TO SEE HER AND THAT ALL THIS EFFECT ON HER NERVOUSSYSTEM WHICH EVIDENTLY INVOLVED SOME NEW TURNING TOWARDS HIMSELF WASDUE TO THE EXCITEMENT OF THE NEW IMPRESSIONS WHICH THAT VISIT HADRAISED
CHAPTER LXXIX
NOW I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT JUST AS THEY HAD ENDED THEIR TALK THEYDREW NIGH TO A VERY MIRY SLOUGH THAT WAS IN THE MIDST OF THE PLAINAND THEY BEING HEEDLESS DID BOTH FALL SUDDENLY INTO THE BOG
 THE NAMEOF THE SLOUGH WAS DESPOND
BUNYAN
WHEN ROSAMOND WAS QUIET AND LYDGATE HAD LEFT HER HOPING THAT SHEMIGHT SOON SLEEP UNDER THE EFFECT OF AN ANODYNE HE WENT INTO THEDRAWINGROOM TO FETCH A BOOK WHICH HE HAD LEFT THERE MEANING TO SPENDTHE EVENING IN HIS WORKROOM AND HE SAW ON THE TABLE DOROTHEAS LETTERADDRESSED TO HIM
 HE HAD NOT VENTURED TO ASK ROSAMOND IF MRS
 CASAUBONHAD CALLED BUT THE READING OF THIS LETTER ASSURED HIM OF THE FACT FORDOROTHEA MENTIONED THAT IT WAS TO BE CARRIED BY HERSELF
WHEN WILL LADISLAW CAME IN A LITTLE LATER LYDGATE MET HIM WITH ASURPRISE WHICH MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN TOLD OF THE EARLIERVISIT AND WILL COULD NOT SAY DID NOT MRS
 LYDGATE TELL YOU THAT ICAME THIS MORNING
POOR ROSAMOND IS ILL LYDGATE ADDED IMMEDIATELY ON HIS GREETING
NOT SERIOUSLY I HOPE SAID WILL
NOONLY A SLIGHT NERVOUS SHOCKTHE EFFECT OF SOME AGITATION
 SHE HASBEEN OVERWROUGHT LATELY
 THE TRUTH IS LADISLAW I AM AN UNLUCKY DEVIL
WE HAVE GONE THROUGH SEVERAL ROUNDS OF PURGATORY SINCE YOU LEFT AND IHAVE LATELY GOT ON TO A WORSE LEDGE OF IT THAN EVER
 I SUPPOSE YOU AREONLY JUST COME DOWNYOU LOOK RATHER BATTEREDYOU HAVE NOT BEEN LONGENOUGH IN THE TOWN TO HEAR ANYTHING
I TRAVELLED ALL NIGHT AND GOT TO THE WHITE HART AT EIGHT OCLOCK THISMORNING
 I HAVE BEEN SHUTTING MYSELF UP AND RESTING SAID WILLFEELING HIMSELF A SNEAK BUT SEEING NO ALTERNATIVE TO THIS EVASION
AND THEN HE HEARD LYDGATES ACCOUNT OF THE TROUBLES WHICH ROSAMOND HADALREADY DEPICTED TO HIM IN HER WAY
 SHE HAD NOT MENTIONED THE FACT OFWILLS NAME BEING CONNECTED WITH THE PUBLIC STORYTHIS DETAIL NOTIMMEDIATELY AFFECTING HERAND HE NOW HEARD IT FOR THE FIRST TIME
I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO TELL YOU THAT YOUR NAME IS MIXED UP WITH THEDISCLOSURES SAID LYDGATE WHO COULD UNDERSTAND BETTER THAN MOST MENHOW LADISLAW MIGHT BE STUNG BY THE REVELATION
 YOU WILL BE SURE TOHEAR IT AS SOON AS YOU TURN OUT INTO THE TOWN
 I SUPPOSE IT IS TRUETHAT RAFFLES SPOKE TO YOU
YES SAID WILL SARDONICALLY
 I SHALL BE FORTUNATE IF GOSSIP DOESNOT MAKE ME THE MOST DISREPUTABLE PERSON IN THE WHOLE AFFAIR
 I SHOULDTHINK THE LATEST VERSION MUST BE THAT I PLOTTED WITH RAFFLES TO MURDERBULSTRODE AND RAN AWAY FROM MIDDLEMARCH FOR THE PURPOSE
HE WAS THINKING HERE IS A NEW RING IN THE SOUND OF MY NAME TORECOMMEND IT IN HER HEARING HOWEVERWHAT DOES IT SIGNIFY NOW
BUT HE SAID NOTHING OF BULSTRODES OFFER TO HIM
 WILL WAS VERY OPEN ANDCARELESS ABOUT HIS PERSONAL AFFAIRS BUT IT WAS AMONG THE MOREEXQUISITE TOUCHES IN NATURES MODELLING OF HIM THAT HE HAD A DELICATEGENEROSITY WHICH WARNED HIM INTO RETICENCE HERE
 HE SHRANK FROM SAYINGTHAT HE HAD REJECTED BULSTRODES MONEY IN THE MOMENT WHEN HE WASLEARNING THAT IT WAS LYDGATES MISFORTUNE TO HAVE ACCEPTED IT
LYDGATE TOO WAS RETICENT IN THE MIDST OF HIS CONFIDENCE
 HE MADE NOALLUSION TO ROSAMONDS FEELING UNDER THEIR TROUBLE AND OF DOROTHEA HEONLY SAID MRS
 CASAUBON HAS BEEN THE ONE PERSON TO COME FORWARD ANDSAY THAT SHE HAD NO BELIEF IN ANY OF THE SUSPICIONS AGAINST ME
OBSERVING A CHANGE IN WILLS FACE HE AVOIDED ANY FURTHER MENTION OFHER FEELING HIMSELF TOO IGNORANT OF THEIR RELATION TO EACH OTHER NOTTO FEAR THAT HIS WORDS MIGHT HAVE SOME HIDDEN PAINFUL BEARING ON IT
AND IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT DOROTHEA WAS THE REAL CAUSE OF THE PRESENTVISIT TO MIDDLEMARCH
THE TWO MEN WERE PITYING EACH OTHER BUT IT WAS ONLY WILL WHO GUESSEDTHE EXTENT OF HIS COMPANIONS TROUBLE
 WHEN LYDGATE SPOKE WITHDESPERATE RESIGNATION OF GOING TO SETTLE IN LONDON AND SAID WITH AFAINT SMILE WE SHALL HAVE YOU AGAIN OLD FELLOW WILL FELTINEXPRESSIBLY MOURNFUL AND SAID NOTHING
 ROSAMOND HAD THAT MORNINGENTREATED HIM TO URGE THIS STEP ON LYDGATE AND IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IFHE WERE BEHOLDING IN A MAGIC PANORAMA A FUTURE WHERE HE HIMSELF WASSLIDING INTO THAT PLEASURELESS YIELDING TO THE SMALL SOLICITATIONS OFCIRCUMSTANCE WHICH IS A COMMONER HISTORY OF PERDITION THAN ANY SINGLEMOMENTOUS BARGAIN
WE ARE ON A PERILOUS MARGIN WHEN WE BEGIN TO LOOK PASSIVELY AT OURFUTURE SELVES AND SEE OUR OWN FIGURES LED WITH DULL CONSENT INTOINSIPID MISDOING AND SHABBY ACHIEVEMENT
 POOR LYDGATE WAS INWARDLYGROANING ON THAT MARGIN AND WILL WAS ARRIVING AT IT
 IT SEEMED TO HIMTHIS EVENING AS IF THE CRUELTY OF HIS OUTBURST TO ROSAMOND HAD MADE ANOBLIGATION FOR HIM AND HE DREADED THE OBLIGATION HE DREADED LYDGATESUNSUSPECTING GOODWILL HE DREADED HIS OWN DISTASTE FOR HIS SPOILEDLIFE WHICH WOULD LEAVE HIM IN MOTIVELESS LEVITY

WORDSWORTH ODE TO DUTY
WHEN DOROTHEA HAD SEEN MR
 FAREBROTHER IN THE MORNING SHE HAD PROMISEDTO GO AND DINE AT THE PARSONAGE ON HER RETURN FROM FRESHITT
 THERE WASA FREQUENT INTERCHANGE OF VISITS BETWEEN HER AND THE FAREBROTHERFAMILY WHICH ENABLED HER TO SAY THAT SHE WAS NOT AT ALL LONELY AT THEMANOR AND TO RESIST FOR THE PRESENT THE SEVERE PRESCRIPTION OF A LADYCOMPANION
 WHEN SHE REACHED HOME AND REMEMBERED HER ENGAGEMENT SHE WASGLAD OF IT AND FINDING THAT SHE HAD STILL AN HOUR BEFORE SHE COULDDRESS FOR DINNER SHE WALKED STRAIGHT TO THE SCHOOLHOUSE AND ENTEREDINTO A CONVERSATION WITH THE MASTER AND MISTRESS ABOUT THE NEW BELLGIVING EAGER ATTENTION TO THEIR SMALL DETAILS AND REPETITIONS ANDGETTING UP A DRAMATIC SENSE THAT HER LIFE WAS VERY BUSY
 SHE PAUSED ONHER WAY BACK TO TALK TO OLD MASTER BUNNEY WHO WAS PUTTING IN SOMEGARDENSEEDS AND DISCOURSED WISELY WITH THAT RURAL SAGE ABOUT THECROPS THAT WOULD MAKE THE MOST RETURN ON A PERCH OF GROUND AND THERESULT OF SIXTY YEARS EXPERIENCE AS TO SOILSNAMELY THAT IF YOUR SOILWAS PRETTY MELLOW IT WOULD DO BUT IF THERE CAME WET WET WET TO MAKEIT ALL OF A MUMMY WHY THENFINDING THAT THE SOCIAL SPIRIT HAD BEGUILED HER INTO BEING RATHER LATESHE DRESSED HASTILY AND WENT OVER TO THE PARSONAGE RATHER EARLIER THANWAS NECESSARY
 THAT HOUSE WAS NEVER DULL MR
 FAREBROTHER LIKE ANOTHERWHITE OF SELBORNE HAVING CONTINUALLY SOMETHING NEW TO TELL OF HISINARTICULATE GUESTS AND PROTEGES WHOM HE WAS TEACHING THE BOYS NOTTO TORMENT AND HE HAD JUST SET UP A PAIR OF BEAUTIFUL GOATS TO BE PETSOF THE VILLAGE IN GENERAL AND TO WALK AT LARGE AS SACRED ANIMALS
 THEEVENING WENT BY CHEERFULLY TILL AFTER TEA DOROTHEA TALKING MORE THANUSUAL AND DILATING WITH MR
 FAREBROTHER ON THE POSSIBLE HISTORIES OFCREATURES THAT CONVERSE COMPENDIOUSLY WITH THEIR ANTENNAE AND FORAUGHT WE KNOW MAY HOLD REFORMED PARLIAMENTS WHEN SUDDENLY SOMEINARTICULATE LITTLE SOUNDS WERE HEARD WHICH CALLED EVERYBODYSATTENTION
HENRIETTA NOBLE SAID MRS
 FAREBROTHER SEEING HER SMALL SISTERMOVING ABOUT THE FURNITURELEGS DISTRESSFULLY WHAT IS THE MATTER
I HAVE LOST MY TORTOISESHELL LOZENGEBOX
 I FEAR THE KITTEN HASROLLED IT AWAY SAID THE TINY OLD LADY INVOLUNTARILY CONTINUING HERBEAVERLIKE NOTES
IS IT A GREAT TREASURE AUNT
 SAID MR
 FAREBROTHER PUTTING UP HISGLASSES AND LOOKING AT THE CARPET
MR
 LADISLAW GAVE IT ME SAID MISS NOBLE
 A GERMAN BOXVERY PRETTYBUT IF IT FALLS IT ALWAYS SPINS AWAY AS FAR AS IT CAN
OH IF IT IS LADISLAWS PRESENT SAID MR
 FAREBROTHER IN A DEEP TONEOF COMPREHENSION GETTING UP AND HUNTING
 THE BOX WAS FOUND AT LASTUNDER A CHIFFONIER AND MISS NOBLE GRASPED IT WITH DELIGHT SAYING ITWAS UNDER A FENDER THE LAST TIME
THAT IS AN AFFAIR OF THE HEART WITH MY AUNT SAID MR
 FAREBROTHERSMILING AT DOROTHEA AS HE RESEATED HIMSELF
IF HENRIETTA NOBLE FORMS AN ATTACHMENT TO ANY ONE MRS
 CASAUBONSAID HIS MOTHER EMPHATICALLYSHE IS LIKE A DOGSHE WOULD TAKE THEIRSHOES FOR A PILLOW AND SLEEP THE BETTER
MR
 LADISLAWS SHOES I WOULD SAID HENRIETTA NOBLE
DOROTHEA MADE AN ATTEMPT AT SMILING IN RETURN
 SHE WAS SURPRISED ANDANNOYED TO FIND THAT HER HEART WAS PALPITATING VIOLENTLY AND THAT ITWAS QUITE USELESS TO TRY AFTER A RECOVERY OF HER FORMER ANIMATION
ALARMED AT HERSELFFEARING SOME FURTHER BETRAYAL OF A CHANGE SO MARKEDIN ITS OCCASION SHE ROSE AND SAID IN A LOW VOICE WITH UNDISGUISEDANXIETY I MUST GO I HAVE OVERTIRED MYSELF
MR
 FAREBROTHER QUICK IN PERCEPTION ROSE AND SAID IT IS TRUE YOUMUST HAVE HALFEXHAUSTED YOURSELF IN TALKING ABOUT LYDGATE
 THAT SORTOF WORK TELLS UPON ONE AFTER THE EXCITEMENT IS OVER
HE GAVE HER HIS ARM BACK TO THE MANOR BUT DOROTHEA DID NOT ATTEMPT TOSPEAK EVEN WHEN HE SAID GOODNIGHT
THE LIMIT OF RESISTANCE WAS REACHED AND SHE HAD SUNK BACK HELPLESSWITHIN THE CLUTCH OF INESCAPABLE ANGUISH
 DISMISSING TANTRIPP WITH AFEW FAINT WORDS SHE LOCKED HER DOOR AND TURNING AWAY FROM IT TOWARDSTHE VACANT ROOM SHE PRESSED HER HANDS HARD ON THE TOP OF HER HEAD ANDMOANED OUTOH I DID LOVE HIM
THEN CAME THE HOUR IN WHICH THE WAVES OF SUFFERING SHOOK HER TOOTHOROUGHLY TO LEAVE ANY POWER OF THOUGHT
 SHE COULD ONLY CRY IN LOUDWHISPERS BETWEEN HER SOBS AFTER HER LOST BELIEF WHICH SHE HAD PLANTEDAND KEPT ALIVE FROM A VERY LITTLE SEED SINCE THE DAYS IN ROMEAFTER HERLOST JOY OF CLINGING WITH SILENT LOVE AND FAITH TO ONE WHO MISPRIZEDBY OTHERS WAS WORTHY IN HER THOUGHTAFTER HER LOST WOMANS PRIDE OFREIGNING IN HIS MEMORYAFTER HER SWEET DIM PERSPECTIVE OF HOPE THATALONG SOME PATHWAY THEY SHOULD MEET WITH UNCHANGED RECOGNITION AND TAKEUP THE BACKWARD YEARS AS A YESTERDAY
IN THAT HOUR SHE REPEATED WHAT THE MERCIFUL EYES OF SOLITUDE HAVELOOKED ON FOR AGES IN THE SPIRITUAL STRUGGLES OF MANSHE BESOUGHTHARDNESS AND COLDNESS AND ACHING WEARINESS TO BRING HER RELIEF FROM THEMYSTERIOUS INCORPOREAL MIGHT OF HER ANGUISH SHE LAY ON THE BARE FLOORAND LET THE NIGHT GROW COLD AROUND HER WHILE HER GRAND WOMANS FRAMEWAS SHAKEN BY SOBS AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A DESPAIRING CHILD
THERE WERE TWO IMAGESTWO LIVING FORMS THAT TORE HER HEART IN TWO ASIF IT HAD BEEN THE HEART OF A MOTHER WHO SEEMS TO SEE HER CHILD DIVIDEDBY THE SWORD AND PRESSES ONE BLEEDING HALF TO HER BREAST WHILE HERGAZE GOES FORTH IN AGONY TOWARDS THE HALF WHICH IS CARRIED AWAY BY THELYING WOMAN THAT HAS NEVER KNOWN THE MOTHERS PANG
HERE WITH THE NEARNESS OF AN ANSWERING SMILE HERE WITHIN THEVIBRATING BOND OF MUTUAL SPEECH WAS THE BRIGHT CREATURE WHOM SHE HADTRUSTEDWHO HAD COME TO HER LIKE THE SPIRIT OF MORNING VISITING THE DIMVAULT WHERE SHE SAT AS THE BRIDE OF A WORNOUT LIFE AND NOW WITH AFULL CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH HAD NEVER AWAKENED BEFORE SHE STRETCHED OUTHER ARMS TOWARDS HIM AND CRIED WITH BITTER CRIES THAT THEIR NEARNESSWAS A PARTING VISION SHE DISCOVERED HER PASSION TO HERSELF IN THEUNSHRINKING UTTERANCE OF DESPAIR
AND THERE ALOOF YET PERSISTENTLY WITH HER MOVING WHEREVER SHE MOVEDWAS THE WILL LADISLAW WHO WAS A CHANGED BELIEF EXHAUSTED OF HOPE ADETECTED ILLUSIONNO A LIVING MAN TOWARDS WHOM THERE COULD NOT YETSTRUGGLE ANY WAIL OF REGRETFUL PITY FROM THE MIDST OF SCORN ANDINDIGNATION AND JEALOUS OFFENDED PRIDE
 THE FIRE OF DOROTHEAS ANGERWAS NOT EASILY SPENT AND IT FLAMED OUT IN FITFUL RETURNS OF SPURNINGREPROACH
 WHY HAD HE COME OBTRUDING HIS LIFE INTO HERS HERS THAT MIGHTHAVE BEEN WHOLE ENOUGH WITHOUT HIM
 WHY HAD HE BROUGHT HIS CHEAP REGARDAND HIS LIPBORN WORDS TO HER WHO HAD NOTHING PALTRY TO GIVE INEXCHANGE
 HE KNEW THAT HE WAS DELUDING HERWISHED IN THE VERY MOMENTOF FAREWELL TO MAKE HER BELIEVE THAT HE GAVE HER THE WHOLE PRICE OFHER HEART AND KNEW THAT HE HAD SPENT IT HALF BEFORE
 WHY HAD HE NOTSTAYED AMONG THE CROWD OF WHOM SHE ASKED NOTHINGBUT ONLY PRAYED THATTHEY MIGHT BE LESS CONTEMPTIBLE
BUT SHE LOST ENERGY AT LAST EVEN FOR HER LOUDWHISPERED CRIES ANDMOANS SHE SUBSIDED INTO HELPLESS SOBS AND ON THE COLD FLOOR SHESOBBED HERSELF TO SLEEP
IN THE CHILL HOURS OF THE MORNING TWILIGHT WHEN ALL WAS DIM AROUNDHER SHE AWOKENOT WITH ANY AMAZED WONDERING WHERE SHE WAS OR WHAT HADHAPPENED BUT WITH THE CLEAREST CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE WAS LOOKING INTOTHE EYES OF SORROW
 SHE ROSE AND WRAPPED WARM THINGS AROUND HER ANDSEATED HERSELF IN A GREAT CHAIR WHERE SHE HAD OFTEN WATCHED BEFORE
 SHEWAS VIGOROUS ENOUGH TO HAVE BORNE THAT HARD NIGHT WITHOUT FEELING ILLIN BODY BEYOND SOME ACHING AND FATIGUE BUT SHE HAD WAKED TO A NEWCONDITION SHE FELT AS IF HER SOUL HAD BEEN LIBERATED FROM ITS TERRIBLECONFLICT SHE WAS NO LONGER WRESTLING WITH HER GRIEF BUT COULD SITDOWN WITH IT AS A LASTING COMPANION AND MAKE IT A SHARER IN HERTHOUGHTS
 FOR NOW THE THOUGHTS CAME THICKLY
 IT WAS NOT IN DOROTHEASNATURE FOR LONGER THAN THE DURATION OF A PAROXYSM TO SIT IN THENARROW CELL OF HER CALAMITY IN THE BESOTTED MISERY OF A CONSCIOUSNESSTHAT ONLY SEES ANOTHERS LOT AS AN ACCIDENT OF ITS OWN
SHE BEGAN NOW TO LIVE THROUGH THAT YESTERDAY MORNING DELIBERATELYAGAIN FORCING HERSELF TO DWELL ON EVERY DETAIL AND ITS POSSIBLEMEANING
 WAS SHE ALONE IN THAT SCENE
 WAS IT HER EVENT ONLY
 SHE FORCEDHERSELF TO THINK OF IT AS BOUND UP WITH ANOTHER WOMANS LIFEA WOMANTOWARDS WHOM SHE HAD SET OUT WITH A LONGING TO CARRY SOME CLEARNESS ANDCOMFORT INTO HER BECLOUDED YOUTH
 IN HER FIRST OUTLEAP OF JEALOUSINDIGNATION AND DISGUST WHEN QUITTING THE HATEFUL ROOM SHE HAD FLUNGAWAY ALL THE MERCY WITH WHICH SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN THAT VISIT
 SHE HADENVELOPED BOTH WILL AND ROSAMOND IN HER BURNING SCORN AND IT SEEMED TOHER AS IF ROSAMOND WERE BURNED OUT OF HER SIGHT FOREVER
 BUT THAT BASEPROMPTING WHICH MAKES A WOMEN MORE CRUEL TO A RIVAL THAN TO A FAITHLESSLOVER COULD HAVE NO STRENGTH OF RECURRENCE IN DOROTHEA WHEN THEDOMINANT SPIRIT OF JUSTICE WITHIN HER HAD ONCE OVERCOME THE TUMULT ANDHAD ONCE SHOWN HER THE TRUER MEASURE OF THINGS
 ALL THE ACTIVE THOUGHTWITH WHICH SHE HAD BEFORE BEEN REPRESENTING TO HERSELF THE TRIALS OFLYDGATES LOT AND THIS YOUNG MARRIAGE UNION WHICH LIKE HER OWNSEEMED TO HAVE ITS HIDDEN AS WELL AS EVIDENT TROUBLESALL THIS VIVIDSYMPATHETIC EXPERIENCE RETURNED TO HER NOW AS A POWER IT ASSERTEDITSELF AS ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE ASSERTS ITSELF AND WILL NOT LET US SEE ASWE SAW IN THE DAY OF OUR IGNORANCE
 SHE SAID TO HER OWN IRREMEDIABLEGRIEF THAT IT SHOULD MAKE HER MORE HELPFUL INSTEAD OF DRIVING HERBACK FROM EFFORT
AND WHAT SORT OF CRISIS MIGHT NOT THIS BE IN THREE LIVES WHOSE CONTACTWITH HERS LAID AN OBLIGATION ON HER AS IF THEY HAD BEEN SUPPLIANTSBEARING THE SACRED BRANCH
 THE OBJECTS OF HER RESCUE WERE NOT TO BESOUGHT OUT BY HER FANCY THEY WERE CHOSEN FOR HER
 SHE YEARNED TOWARDSTHE PERFECT RIGHT THAT IT MIGHT MAKE A THRONE WITHIN HER AND RULE HERERRANT WILL
 WHAT SHOULD I DOHOW SHOULD I ACT NOW THIS VERY DAY IFI COULD CLUTCH MY OWN PAIN AND COMPEL IT TO SILENCE AND THINK OFTHOSE THREE
IT HAD TAKEN LONG FOR HER TO COME TO THAT QUESTION AND THERE WAS LIGHTPIERCING INTO THE ROOM
 SHE OPENED HER CURTAINS AND LOOKED OUT TOWARDSTHE BIT OF ROAD THAT LAY IN VIEW WITH FIELDS BEYOND OUTSIDE THEENTRANCEGATES
 ON THE ROAD THERE WAS A MAN WITH A BUNDLE ON HIS BACKAND A WOMAN CARRYING HER BABY IN THE FIELD SHE COULD SEE FIGURESMOVINGPERHAPS THE SHEPHERD WITH HIS DOG
 FAR OFF IN THE BENDING SKYWAS THE PEARLY LIGHT AND SHE FELT THE LARGENESS OF THE WORLD AND THEMANIFOLD WAKINGS OF MEN TO LABOR AND ENDURANCE
 SHE WAS A PART OF THATINVOLUNTARY PALPITATING LIFE AND COULD NEITHER LOOK OUT ON IT FROMHER LUXURIOUS SHELTER AS A MERE SPECTATOR NOR HIDE HER EYES IN SELFISHCOMPLAINING
WHAT SHE WOULD RESOLVE TO DO THAT DAY DID NOT YET SEEM QUITE CLEAR BUTSOMETHING THAT SHE COULD ACHIEVE STIRRED HER AS WITH AN APPROACHINGMURMUR WHICH WOULD SOON GATHER DISTINCTNESS
 SHE TOOK OFF THE CLOTHESWHICH SEEMED TO HAVE SOME OF THE WEARINESS OF A HARD WATCHING IN THEMAND BEGAN TO MAKE HER TOILET
 PRESENTLY SHE RANG FOR TANTRIPP WHO CAMEIN HER DRESSINGGOWN
WHY MADAM YOUVE NEVER BEEN IN BED THIS BLESSED NIGHT BURST OUTTANTRIPP LOOKING FIRST AT THE BED AND THEN AT DOROTHEAS FACE WHICHIN SPITE OF BATHING HAD THE PALE CHEEKS AND PINK EYELIDS OF A MATERDOLOROSA
 YOULL KILL YOURSELF YOU WILL
 ANYBODY MIGHT THINK NOWYOU HAD A RIGHT TO GIVE YOURSELF A LITTLE COMFORT
DONT BE ALARMED TANTRIPP SAID DOROTHEA SMILING

 I SHALL BE GLAD OF A CUP OF COFFEE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
 ANDI WANT YOU TO BRING ME MY NEW DRESS AND MOST LIKELY I SHALL WANT MYNEW BONNET TODAY

 THERES A REASON INMOURNING AS IVE ALWAYS SAID AND THREE FOLDS AT THE BOTTOM OF YOURSKIRT AND A PLAIN QUILLING IN YOUR BONNETAND IF EVER ANYBODY LOOKEDLIKE AN ANGEL ITS YOU IN A NET QUILLINGIS WHATS CONSISTENT FOR ASECOND YEAR
 AT LEAST THATS MY THINKING ENDED TANTRIPP LOOKINGANXIOUSLY AT THE FIRE AND IF ANYBODY WAS TO MARRY ME FLATTERINGHIMSELF I SHOULD WEAR THOSE HIJEOUS WEEPERS TWO YEARS FOR HIM HED BEDECEIVED BY HIS OWN VANITY THATS ALL
THE FIRE WILL DO MY GOOD TAN SAID DOROTHEA SPEAKING AS SHE USED TODO IN THE OLD LAUSANNE DAYS ONLY WITH A VERY LOW VOICE GET ME THECOFFEE
SHE FOLDED HERSELF IN THE LARGE CHAIR AND LEANED HER HEAD AGAINST ITIN FATIGUED QUIESCENCE WHILE TANTRIPP WENT AWAY WONDERING AT THISSTRANGE CONTRARINESS IN HER YOUNG MISTRESSTHAT JUST THE MORNING WHENSHE HAD MORE OF A WIDOWS FACE THAN EVER SHE SHOULD HAVE ASKED FOR HERLIGHTER MOURNING WHICH SHE HAD WAIVED BEFORE
 TANTRIPP WOULD NEVER HAVEFOUND THE CLEW TO THIS MYSTERY
 DOROTHEA WISHED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHEHAD NOT THE LESS AN ACTIVE LIFE BEFORE HER BECAUSE SHE HAD BURIED APRIVATE JOY AND THE TRADITION THAT FRESH GARMENTS BELONGED TO ALLINITIATION HAUNTING HER MIND MADE HER GRASP AFTER EVEN THAT SLIGHTOUTWARD HELP TOWARDS CALM RESOLVE
 FOR THE RESOLVE WAS NOT EASY
NEVERTHELESS AT ELEVEN OCLOCK SHE WAS WALKING TOWARDS MIDDLEMARCHHAVING MADE UP HER MIND THAT SHE WOULD MAKE AS QUIETLY AND UNNOTICEABLYAS POSSIBLE HER SECOND ATTEMPT TO SEE AND SAVE ROSAMOND

FAUST R THEIL
WHEN DOROTHEA WAS AGAIN AT LYDGATES DOOR SPEAKING TO MARTHA HE WAS INTHE ROOM CLOSE BY WITH THE DOOR AJAR PREPARING TO GO OUT
 HE HEARD HERVOICE AND IMMEDIATELY CAME TO HER
DO YOU THINK THAT MRS
 LYDGATE CAN RECEIVE ME THIS MORNING
 SHE SAIDHAVING REFLECTED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO LEAVE OUT ALL ALLUSION TOHER PREVIOUS VISIT
I HAVE NO DOUBT SHE WILL SAID LYDGATE SUPPRESSING HIS THOUGHT ABOUTDOROTHEAS LOOKS WHICH WERE AS MUCH CHANGED AS ROSAMONDS IF YOUWILL BE KIND ENOUGH TO COME IN AND LET ME TELL HER THAT YOU ARE HERE
SHE HAS NOT BEEN VERY WELL SINCE YOU WERE HERE YESTERDAY BUT SHE ISBETTER THIS MORNING AND I THINK IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT SHE WILL BECHEERED BY SEEING YOU AGAIN
IT WAS PLAIN THAT LYDGATE AS DOROTHEA HAD EXPECTED KNEW NOTHING ABOUTTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER YESTERDAYS VISIT NAY HE APPEARED TO IMAGINETHAT SHE HAD CARRIED IT OUT ACCORDING TO HER INTENTION
 SHE HADPREPARED A LITTLE NOTE ASKING ROSAMOND TO SEE HER WHICH SHE WOULD HAVEGIVEN TO THE SERVANT IF HE HAD NOT BEEN IN THE WAY BUT NOW SHE WAS INMUCH ANXIETY AS TO THE RESULT OF HIS ANNOUNCEMENT
AFTER LEADING HER INTO THE DRAWINGROOM HE PAUSED TO TAKE A LETTERFROM HIS POCKET AND PUT IT INTO HER HANDS SAYING I WROTE THIS LASTNIGHT AND WAS GOING TO CARRY IT TO LOWICK IN MY RIDE
 WHEN ONE ISGRATEFUL FOR SOMETHING TOO GOOD FOR COMMON THANKS WRITING IS LESSUNSATISFACTORY THAN SPEECHONE DOES NOT AT LEAST HEAR HOW INADEQUATETHE WORDS ARE
DOROTHEAS FACE BRIGHTENED
 IT IS I WHO HAVE MOST TO THANK FOR SINCEYOU HAVE LET ME TAKE THAT PLACE
 YOU HAVE CONSENTED
 SHE SAIDSUDDENLY DOUBTING
YES THE CHECK IS GOING TO BULSTRODE TODAY
HE SAID NO MORE BUT WENT UPSTAIRS TO ROSAMOND WHO HAD BUT LATELYFINISHED DRESSING HERSELF AND SAT LANGUIDLY WONDERING WHAT SHE SHOULDDO NEXT HER HABITUAL INDUSTRY IN SMALL THINGS EVEN IN THE DAYS OF HERSADNESS PROMPTING HER TO BEGIN SOME KIND OF OCCUPATION WHICH SHEDRAGGED THROUGH SLOWLY OR PAUSED IN FROM LACK OF INTEREST
 SHE LOOKEDILL BUT HAD RECOVERED HER USUAL QUIETUDE OF MANNER AND LYDGATE HADFEARED TO DISTURB HER BY ANY QUESTIONS
 HE HAD TOLD HER OF DOROTHEASLETTER CONTAINING THE CHECK AND AFTERWARDS HE HAD SAID LADISLAW ISCOME ROSY HE SAT WITH ME LAST NIGHT I DARE SAY HE WILL BE HERE AGAINTODAY
 I THOUGHT HE LOOKED RATHER BATTERED AND DEPRESSED
 ANDROSAMOND HAD MADE NO REPLY
NOW WHEN HE CAME UP HE SAID TO HER VERY GENTLY ROSY DEAR MRS
CASAUBON IS COME TO SEE YOU AGAIN YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER WOULD YOUNOT
 THAT SHE COLORED AND GAVE RATHER A STARTLED MOVEMENT DID NOTSURPRISE HIM AFTER THE AGITATION PRODUCED BY THE INTERVIEW YESTERDAYABENEFICENT AGITATION HE THOUGHT SINCE IT SEEMED TO HAVE MADE HER TURNTO HIM AGAIN
ROSAMOND DARED NOT SAY NO
 SHE DARED NOT WITH A TONE OF HER VOICE TOUCHTHE FACTS OF YESTERDAY
 WHY HAD MRS
 CASAUBON COME AGAIN
 THE ANSWERWAS A BLANK WHICH ROSAMOND COULD ONLY FILL UP WITH DREAD FOR WILLLADISLAWS LACERATING WORDS HAD MADE EVERY THOUGHT OF DOROTHEA A FRESHSMART TO HER
 NEVERTHELESS IN HER NEW HUMILIATING UNCERTAINTY SHEDARED DO NOTHING BUT COMPLY
 SHE DID NOT SAY YES BUT SHE ROSE AND LETLYDGATE PUT A LIGHT SHAWL OVER HER SHOULDERS WHILE HE SAID I AMGOING OUT IMMEDIATELY
 THEN SOMETHING CROSSED HER MIND WHICH PROMPTEDHER TO SAY PRAY TELL MARTHA NOT TO BRING ANY ONE ELSE INTO THEDRAWINGROOM
 AND LYDGATE ASSENTED THINKING THAT HE FULLY UNDERSTOODTHIS WISH
 HE LED HER DOWN TO THE DRAWINGROOM DOOR AND THEN TURNEDAWAY OBSERVING TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS RATHER A BLUNDERING HUSBAND TOBE DEPENDENT FOR HIS WIFES TRUST IN HIM ON THE INFLUENCE OF ANOTHERWOMAN
ROSAMOND WRAPPING HER SOFT SHAWL AROUND HER AS SHE WALKED TOWARDSDOROTHEA WAS INWARDLY WRAPPING HER SOUL IN COLD RESERVE
 HAD MRS
CASAUBON COME TO SAY ANYTHING TO HER ABOUT WILL
 IF SO IT WAS ALIBERTY THAT ROSAMOND RESENTED AND SHE PREPARED HERSELF TO MEET EVERYWORD WITH POLITE IMPASSIBILITY
 WILL HAD BRUISED HER PRIDE TOO SORELYFOR HER TO FEEL ANY COMPUNCTION TOWARDS HIM AND DOROTHEA HER OWNINJURY SEEMED MUCH THE GREATER
 DOROTHEA WAS NOT ONLY THE PREFERREDWOMAN BUT HAD ALSO A FORMIDABLE ADVANTAGE IN BEING LYDGATESBENEFACTOR AND TO POOR ROSAMONDS PAINED CONFUSED VISION IT SEEMEDTHAT THIS MRS
 CASAUBONTHIS WOMAN WHO PREDOMINATED IN ALL THINGSCONCERNING HERMUST HAVE COME NOW WITH THE SENSE OF HAVING THEADVANTAGE AND WITH ANIMOSITY PROMPTING HER TO USE IT
 INDEED NOTROSAMOND ONLY BUT ANY ONE ELSE KNOWING THE OUTER FACTS OF THE CASEAND NOT THE SIMPLE INSPIRATION ON WHICH DOROTHEA ACTED MIGHT WELL HAVEWONDERED WHY SHE CAME
LOOKING LIKE THE LOVELY GHOST OF HERSELF HER GRACEFUL SLIMNESS WRAPPEDIN HER SOFT WHITE SHAWL THE ROUNDED INFANTINE MOUTH AND CHEEKINEVITABLY SUGGESTING MILDNESS AND INNOCENCE ROSAMOND PAUSED AT THREEYARDS DISTANCE FROM HER VISITOR AND BOWED
 BUT DOROTHEA WHO HAD TAKENOFF HER GLOVES FROM AN IMPULSE WHICH SHE COULD NEVER RESIST WHEN SHEWANTED A SENSE OF FREEDOM CAME FORWARD AND WITH HER FACE FULL OF ASAD YET SWEET OPENNESS PUT OUT HER HAND
 ROSAMOND COULD NOT AVOIDMEETING HER GLANCE COULD NOT AVOID PUTTING HER SMALL HAND INTODOROTHEAS WHICH CLASPED IT WITH GENTLE MOTHERLINESS AND IMMEDIATELYA DOUBT OF HER OWN PREPOSSESSIONS BEGAN TO STIR WITHIN HER
 ROSAMONDSEYE WAS QUICK FOR FACES SHE SAW THAT MRS
 CASAUBONS FACE LOOKED PALEAND CHANGED SINCE YESTERDAY YET GENTLE AND LIKE THE FIRM SOFTNESS OFHER HAND
 BUT DOROTHEA HAD COUNTED A LITTLE TOO MUCH ON HER OWNSTRENGTH THE CLEARNESS AND INTENSITY OF HER MENTAL ACTION THIS MORNINGWERE THE CONTINUANCE OF A NERVOUS EXALTATION WHICH MADE HER FRAME ASDANGEROUSLY RESPONSIVE AS A BIT OF FINEST VENETIAN CRYSTAL AND INLOOKING AT ROSAMOND SHE SUDDENLY FOUND HER HEART SWELLING AND WASUNABLE TO SPEAKALL HER EFFORT WAS REQUIRED TO KEEP BACK TEARS
 SHESUCCEEDED IN THAT AND THE EMOTION ONLY PASSED OVER HER FACE LIKE THESPIRIT OF A SOB BUT IT ADDED TO ROSAMONDS IMPRESSION THAT MRS
CASAUBONS STATE OF MIND MUST BE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHATSHE HAD IMAGINED
SO THEY SAT DOWN WITHOUT A WORD OF PREFACE ON THE TWO CHAIRS THATHAPPENED TO BE NEAREST AND HAPPENED ALSO TO BE CLOSE TOGETHER THOUGHROSAMONDS NOTION WHEN SHE FIRST BOWED WAS THAT SHE SHOULD STAY A LONGWAY OFF FROM MRS
 CASAUBON
 BUT SHE CEASED THINKING HOW ANYTHING WOULDTURN OUTMERELY WONDERING WHAT WOULD COME
 AND DOROTHEA BEGAN TO SPEAKQUITE SIMPLY GATHERING FIRMNESS AS SHE WENT ON
I HAD AN ERRAND YESTERDAY WHICH I DID NOT FINISH THAT IS WHY I AMHERE AGAIN SO SOON
 YOU WILL NOT THINK ME TOO TROUBLESOME WHEN I TELLYOU THAT I CAME TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE INJUSTICE THAT HAS BEEN SHOWNTOWARDS MR
 LYDGATE
 IT WILL CHEER YOUWILL IT NOT
TO KNOW A GREATDEAL ABOUT HIM THAT HE MAY NOT LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT HIMSELF JUSTBECAUSE IT IS IN HIS OWN VINDICATION AND TO HIS OWN HONOR
 YOU WILLLIKE TO KNOW THAT YOUR HUSBAND HAS WARM FRIENDS WHO HAVE NOT LEFT OFFBELIEVING IN HIS HIGH CHARACTER
 YOU WILL LET ME SPEAK OF THIS WITHOUTTHINKING THAT I TAKE A LIBERTY
THE CORDIAL PLEADING TONES WHICH SEEMED TO FLOW WITH GENEROUSHEEDLESSNESS ABOVE ALL THE FACTS WHICH HAD FILLED ROSAMONDS MIND ASGROUNDS OF OBSTRUCTION AND HATRED BETWEEN HER AND THIS WOMAN CAME ASSOOTHINGLY AS A WARM STREAM OVER HER SHRINKING FEARS
 OF COURSE MRS
CASAUBON HAD THE FACTS IN HER MIND BUT SHE WAS NOT GOING TO SPEAK OFANYTHING CONNECTED WITH THEM
 THAT RELIEF WAS TOO GREAT FOR ROSAMOND TOFEEL MUCH ELSE AT THE MOMENT
 SHE ANSWERED PRETTILY IN THE NEW EASE OFHER SOULI KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD
 I SHALL LIKE TO HEAR ANYTHING YOU WILLSAY TO ME ABOUT TERTIUS
THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY SAID DOROTHEA WHEN I HAD ASKED HIM TOCOME TO LOWICK TO GIVE ME HIS OPINION ON THE AFFAIRS OF THE HOSPITALHE TOLD ME EVERYTHING ABOUT HIS CONDUCT AND FEELINGS IN THIS SAD EVENTWHICH HAS MADE IGNORANT PEOPLE CAST SUSPICIONS ON HIM
 THE REASON HETOLD ME WAS BECAUSE I WAS VERY BOLD AND ASKED HIM
 I BELIEVED THAT HEHAD NEVER ACTED DISHONORABLY AND I BEGGED HIM TO TELL ME THE HISTORY
HE CONFESSED TO ME THAT HE HAD NEVER TOLD IT BEFORE NOT EVEN TO YOUBECAUSE HE HAD A GREAT DISLIKE TO SAY I WAS NOT WRONG AS IF THATWERE PROOF WHEN THERE ARE GUILTY PEOPLE WHO WILL SAY SO
 THE TRUTH ISHE KNEW NOTHING OF THIS MAN RAFFLES OR THAT THERE WERE ANY BAD SECRETSABOUT HIM AND HE THOUGHT THAT MR
 BULSTRODE OFFERED HIM THE MONEYBECAUSE HE REPENTED OUT OF KINDNESS OF HAVING REFUSED IT BEFORE
 ALLHIS ANXIETY ABOUT HIS PATIENT WAS TO TREAT HIM RIGHTLY AND HE WAS ALITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE THAT THE CASE DID NOT END AS HE HAD EXPECTED BUTHE THOUGHT THEN AND STILL THINKS THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN NO WRONG INIT ON ANY ONES PART
 AND I HAVE TOLD MR
 FAREBROTHER AND MR
 BROOKEAND SIR JAMES CHETTAM THEY ALL BELIEVE IN YOUR HUSBAND
 THAT WILLCHEER YOU WILL IT NOT
 THAT WILL GIVE YOU COURAGE
DOROTHEAS FACE HAD BECOME ANIMATED AND AS IT BEAMED ON ROSAMOND VERYCLOSE TO HER SHE FELT SOMETHING LIKE BASHFUL TIMIDITY BEFORE ASUPERIOR IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS SELFFORGETFUL ARDOR
 SHE SAID WITHBLUSHING EMBARRASSMENT THANK YOU YOU ARE VERY KIND
AND HE FELT THAT HE HAD BEEN SO WRONG NOT TO POUR OUT EVERYTHING ABOUTTHIS TO YOU
 BUT YOU WILL FORGIVE HIM
 IT WAS BECAUSE HE FEELS SO MUCHMORE ABOUT YOUR HAPPINESS THAN ANYTHING ELSEHE FEELS HIS LIFE BOUNDINTO ONE WITH YOURS AND IT HURTS HIM MORE THAN ANYTHING THAT HISMISFORTUNES MUST HURT YOU
 HE COULD SPEAK TO ME BECAUSE I AM ANINDIFFERENT PERSON
 AND THEN I ASKED HIM IF I MIGHT COME TO SEE YOUBECAUSE I FELT SO MUCH FOR HIS TROUBLE AND YOURS
 THAT IS WHY I CAMEYESTERDAY AND WHY I AM COME TODAY
 TROUBLE IS SO HARD TO BEAR IS ITNOT
 HOW CAN WE LIVE AND THINK THAT ANY ONE HAS TROUBLEPIERCINGTROUBLEAND WE COULD HELP THEM AND NEVER TRY
DOROTHEA COMPLETELY SWAYED BY THE FEELING THAT SHE WAS UTTERINGFORGOT EVERYTHING BUT THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING FROM OUT THE HEART OF HEROWN TRIAL TO ROSAMONDS
 THE EMOTION HAD WROUGHT ITSELF MORE AND MOREINTO HER UTTERANCE TILL THE TONES MIGHT HAVE GONE TO ONES VERYMARROW LIKE A LOW CRY FROM SOME SUFFERING CREATURE IN THE DARKNESS
AND SHE HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY LAID HER HAND AGAIN ON THE LITTLE HAND THATSHE HAD PRESSED BEFORE
ROSAMOND WITH AN OVERMASTERING PANG AS IF A WOUND WITHIN HER HAD BEENPROBED BURST INTO HYSTERICAL CRYING AS SHE HAD DONE THE DAY BEFOREWHEN SHE CLUNG TO HER HUSBAND
 POOR DOROTHEA WAS FEELING A GREAT WAVEOF HER OWN SORROW RETURNING OVER HERHER THOUGHT BEING DRAWN TO THEPOSSIBLE SHARE THAT WILL LADISLAW MIGHT HAVE IN ROSAMONDS MENTALTUMULT
 SHE WAS BEGINNING TO FEAR THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TOSUPPRESS HERSELF ENOUGH TO THE END OF THIS MEETING AND WHILE HER HANDWAS STILL RESTING ON ROSAMONDS LAP THOUGH THE HAND UNDERNEATH IT WASWITHDRAWN SHE WAS STRUGGLING AGAINST HER OWN RISING SOBS
 SHE TRIED TOMASTER HERSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT THIS MIGHT BE A TURNINGPOINT INTHREE LIVESNOT IN HER OWN NO THERE THE IRREVOCABLE HAD HAPPENEDBUTIN THOSE THREE LIVES WHICH WERE TOUCHING HERS WITH THE SOLEMNNEIGHBORHOOD OF DANGER AND DISTRESS
 THE FRAGILE CREATURE WHO WASCRYING CLOSE TO HERTHERE MIGHT STILL BE TIME TO RESCUE HER FROM THEMISERY OF FALSE INCOMPATIBLE BONDS AND THIS MOMENT WAS UNLIKE ANYOTHER SHE AND ROSAMOND COULD NEVER BE TOGETHER AGAIN WITH THE SAMETHRILLING CONSCIOUSNESS OF YESTERDAY WITHIN THEM BOTH
 SHE FELT THERELATION BETWEEN THEM TO BE PECULIAR ENOUGH TO GIVE HER A PECULIARINFLUENCE THOUGH SHE HAD NO CONCEPTION THAT THE WAY IN WHICH HER OWNFEELINGS WERE INVOLVED WAS FULLY KNOWN TO MRS
 LYDGATE
IT WAS A NEWER CRISIS IN ROSAMONDS EXPERIENCE THAN EVEN DOROTHEA COULDIMAGINE SHE WAS UNDER THE FIRST GREAT SHOCK THAT HAD SHATTERED HERDREAMWORLD IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN EASILY CONFIDENT OF HERSELF ANDCRITICAL OF OTHERS AND THIS STRANGE UNEXPECTED MANIFESTATION OFFEELING IN A WOMAN WHOM SHE HAD APPROACHED WITH A SHRINKING AVERSIONAND DREAD AS ONE WHO MUST NECESSARILY HAVE A JEALOUS HATRED TOWARDSHER MADE HER SOUL TOTTER ALL THE MORE WITH A SENSE THAT SHE HAD BEENWALKING IN AN UNKNOWN WORLD WHICH HAD JUST BROKEN IN UPON HER
WHEN ROSAMONDS CONVULSED THROAT WAS SUBSIDING INTO CALM AND SHEWITHDREW THE HANDKERCHIEF WITH WHICH SHE HAD BEEN HIDING HER FACE HEREYES MET DOROTHEAS AS HELPLESSLY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN BLUE FLOWERS
WHAT WAS THE USE OF THINKING ABOUT BEHAVIOR AFTER THIS CRYING
 ANDDOROTHEA LOOKED ALMOST AS CHILDISH WITH THE NEGLECTED TRACE OF ASILENT TEAR
 PRIDE WAS BROKEN DOWN BETWEEN THESE TWO
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND DOROTHEA SAID WITH SOMETIMIDITY
 I THOUGHT HIS LOOKS WERE SADLY CHANGED WITH SUFFERING THEOTHER DAY
 I HAD NOT SEEN HIM FOR MANY WEEKS BEFORE
 HE SAID HE HADBEEN FEELING VERY LONELY IN HIS TRIAL BUT I THINK HE WOULD HAVE BORNEIT ALL BETTER IF HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO BE QUITE OPEN WITH YOU
TERTIUS IS SO ANGRY AND IMPATIENT IF I SAY ANYTHING SAID ROSAMONDIMAGINING THAT HE HAD BEEN COMPLAINING OF HER TO DOROTHEA
 HE OUGHTNOT TO WONDER THAT I OBJECT TO SPEAK TO HIM ON PAINFUL SUBJECTS
IT WAS HIMSELF HE BLAMED FOR NOT SPEAKING SAID DOROTHEA
 WHAT HESAID OF YOU WAS THAT HE COULD NOT BE HAPPY IN DOING ANYTHING WHICHMADE YOU UNHAPPYTHAT HIS MARRIAGE WAS OF COURSE A BOND WHICH MUSTAFFECT HIS CHOICE ABOUT EVERYTHING AND FOR THAT REASON HE REFUSED MYPROPOSAL THAT HE SHOULD KEEP HIS POSITION AT THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE THATWOULD BIND HIM TO STAY IN MIDDLEMARCH AND HE WOULD NOT UNDERTAKE TO DOANYTHING WHICH WOULD BE PAINFUL TO YOU
 HE COULD SAY THAT TO MEBECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT I HAD MUCH TRIAL IN MY MARRIAGE FROM MYHUSBANDS ILLNESS WHICH HINDERED HIS PLANS AND SADDENED HIM AND HEKNOWS THAT I HAVE FELT HOW HARD IT IS TO WALK ALWAYS IN FEAR OF HURTINGANOTHER WHO IS TIED TO US
DOROTHEA WAITED A LITTLE SHE HAD DISCERNED A FAINT PLEASURE STEALINGOVER ROSAMONDS FACE
 BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND SHE WENT ON WITH AGATHERING TREMOR MARRIAGE IS SO UNLIKE EVERYTHING ELSE
 THERE ISSOMETHING EVEN AWFUL IN THE NEARNESS IT BRINGS
 EVEN IF WE LOVED SOMEONE ELSE BETTER THANTHAN THOSE WE WERE MARRIED TO IT WOULD BE NOUSEPOOR DOROTHEA IN HER PALPITATING ANXIETY COULD ONLY SEIZE HERLANGUAGE BROKENLYI MEAN MARRIAGE DRINKS UP ALL OUR POWER OF GIVINGOR GETTING ANY BLESSEDNESS IN THAT SORT OF LOVE
 I KNOW IT MAY BE VERYDEARBUT IT MURDERS OUR MARRIAGEAND THEN THE MARRIAGE STAYS WITH USLIKE A MURDERAND EVERYTHING ELSE IS GONE
 AND THEN OUR HUSBANDIF HELOVED AND TRUSTED US AND WE HAVE NOT HELPED HIM BUT MADE A CURSE INHIS LIFEHER VOICE HAD SUNK VERY LOW THERE WAS A DREAD UPON HER OF PRESUMINGTOO FAR AND OF SPEAKING AS IF SHE HERSELF WERE PERFECTION ADDRESSINGERROR
 SHE WAS TOO MUCH PREOCCUPIED WITH HER OWN ANXIETY TO BE AWARETHAT ROSAMOND WAS TREMBLING TOO AND FILLED WITH THE NEED TO EXPRESSPITYING FELLOWSHIP RATHER THAN REBUKE SHE PUT HER HANDS ON ROSAMONDSAND SAID WITH MORE AGITATED RAPIDITYI KNOW I KNOW THAT THE FEELINGMAY BE VERY DEARIT HAS TAKEN HOLD OF US UNAWARESIT IS SO HARD IT MAYSEEM LIKE DEATH TO PART WITH ITAND WE ARE WEAKI AM WEAKTHE WAVES OF HER OWN SORROW FROM OUT OF WHICH SHE WAS STRUGGLING TOSAVE ANOTHER RUSHED OVER DOROTHEA WITH CONQUERING FORCE
 SHE STOPPEDIN SPEECHLESS AGITATION NOT CRYING BUT FEELING AS IF SHE WERE BEINGINWARDLY GRAPPLED
 HER FACE HAD BECOME OF A DEATHLIER PALENESS HERLIPS TREMBLED AND SHE PRESSED HER HANDS HELPLESSLY ON THE HANDS THATLAY UNDER THEM
ROSAMOND TAKEN HOLD OF BY AN EMOTION STRONGER THAN HER OWNHURRIEDALONG IN A NEW MOVEMENT WHICH GAVE ALL THINGS SOME NEW AWFULUNDEFINED ASPECTCOULD FIND NO WORDS BUT INVOLUNTARILY SHE PUT HERLIPS TO DOROTHEAS FOREHEAD WHICH WAS VERY NEAR HER AND THEN FOR AMINUTE THE TWO WOMEN CLASPED EACH OTHER AS IF THEY HAD BEEN IN ASHIPWRECK
YOU ARE THINKING WHAT IS NOT TRUE SAID ROSAMOND IN AN EAGERHALFWHISPER WHILE SHE WAS STILL FEELING DOROTHEAS ARMS ROUNDHERURGED BY A MYSTERIOUS NECESSITY TO FREE HERSELF FROM SOMETHING THATOPPRESSED HER AS IF IT WERE BLOOD GUILTINESS
THEY MOVED APART LOOKING AT EACH OTHER
WHEN YOU CAME IN YESTERDAYIT WAS NOT AS YOU THOUGHT SAID ROSAMONDIN THE SAME TONE
THERE WAS A MOVEMENT OF SURPRISED ATTENTION IN DOROTHEA
 SHE EXPECTED AVINDICATION OF ROSAMOND HERSELF
HE WAS TELLING ME HOW HE LOVED ANOTHER WOMAN THAT I MIGHT KNOW HECOULD NEVER LOVE ME SAID ROSAMOND GETTING MORE AND MORE HURRIED ASSHE WENT ON
 AND NOW I THINK HE HATES ME BECAUSEBECAUSE YOU MISTOOKHIM YESTERDAY
 HE SAYS IT IS THROUGH ME THAT YOU WILL THINK ILL OFHIMTHINK THAT HE IS A FALSE PERSON
 BUT IT SHALL NOT BE THROUGH ME
 HEHAS NEVER HAD ANY LOVE FOR MEI KNOW HE HAS NOTHE HAS ALWAYS THOUGHTSLIGHTLY OF ME
 HE SAID YESTERDAY THAT NO OTHER WOMAN EXISTED FOR HIMBESIDE YOU
 THE BLAME OF WHAT HAPPENED IS ENTIRELY MINE
 HE SAID HECOULD NEVER EXPLAIN TO YOUBECAUSE OF ME
 HE SAID YOU COULD NEVER THINKWELL OF HIM AGAIN
 BUT NOW I HAVE TOLD YOU AND HE CANNOT REPROACH MEANY MORE
ROSAMOND HAD DELIVERED HER SOUL UNDER IMPULSES WHICH SHE HAD NOT KNOWNBEFORE
 SHE HAD BEGUN HER CONFESSION UNDER THE SUBDUING INFLUENCE OFDOROTHEAS EMOTION AND AS SHE WENT ON SHE HAD GATHERED THE SENSE THATSHE WAS REPELLING WILLS REPROACHES WHICH WERE STILL LIKE AKNIFEWOUND WITHIN HER
THE REVULSION OF FEELING IN DOROTHEA WAS TOO STRONG TO BE CALLED JOY
IT WAS A TUMULT IN WHICH THE TERRIBLE STRAIN OF THE NIGHT AND MORNINGMADE A RESISTANT PAINSHE COULD ONLY PERCEIVE THAT THIS WOULD BE JOYWHEN SHE HAD RECOVERED HER POWER OF FEELING IT
 HER IMMEDIATECONSCIOUSNESS WAS ONE OF IMMENSE SYMPATHY WITHOUT CHECK SHE CARED FORROSAMOND WITHOUT STRUGGLE NOW AND RESPONDED EARNESTLY TO HER LASTWORDSNO HE CANNOT REPROACH YOU ANY MORE
WITH HER USUAL TENDENCY TO OVERESTIMATE THE GOOD IN OTHERS SHE FELT AGREAT OUTGOING OF HER HEART TOWARDS ROSAMOND FOR THE GENEROUS EFFORTWHICH HAD REDEEMED HER FROM SUFFERING NOT COUNTING THAT THE EFFORT WASA REFLEX OF HER OWN ENERGY
 AFTER THEY HAD BEEN SILENT A LITTLE SHESAIDYOU ARE NOT SORRY THAT I CAME THIS MORNING
NO YOU HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME SAID ROSAMOND
 I DID NOT THINKTHAT YOU WOULD BE SO GOOD
 I WAS VERY UNHAPPY
 I AM NOT HAPPY NOW
EVERYTHING IS SO SAD
BUT BETTER DAYS WILL COME
 YOUR HUSBAND WILL BE RIGHTLY VALUED
 AND HEDEPENDS ON YOU FOR COMFORT
 HE LOVES YOU BEST
 THE WORST LOSS WOULD BETO LOSE THATAND YOU HAVE NOT LOST IT SAID DOROTHEA
SHE TRIED TO THRUST AWAY THE TOO OVERPOWERING THOUGHT OF HER OWNRELIEF LEST SHE SHOULD FAIL TO WIN SOME SIGN THAT ROSAMONDS AFFECTIONWAS YEARNING BACK TOWARDS HER HUSBAND
TERTIUS DID NOT FIND FAULT WITH ME THEN
 SAID ROSAMONDUNDERSTANDING NOW THAT LYDGATE MIGHT HAVE SAID ANYTHING TO MRS
CASAUBON AND THAT SHE CERTAINLY WAS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER WOMEN
PERHAPS THERE WAS A FAINT TASTE OF JEALOUSY IN THE QUESTION
 A SMILEBEGAN TO PLAY OVER DOROTHEAS FACE AS SHE SAIDNO INDEED
 HOW COULD YOU IMAGINE IT
 BUT HERE THE DOOR OPENED ANDLYDGATE ENTERED
I AM COME BACK IN MY QUALITY OF DOCTOR HE SAID
 AFTER I WENT AWAYI WAS HAUNTED BY TWO PALE FACES MRS
 CASAUBON LOOKED AS MUCH IN NEEDOF CARE AS YOU ROSY
 AND I THOUGHT THAT I HAD NOT DONE MY DUTY INLEAVING YOU TOGETHER SO WHEN I HAD BEEN TO COLEMANS I CAME HOMEAGAIN
 I NOTICED THAT YOU WERE WALKING MRS
 CASAUBON AND THE SKY HASCHANGEDI THINK WE MAY HAVE RAIN
 MAY I SEND SOME ONE TO ORDER YOURCARRIAGE TO COME FOR YOU
OH NO
 I AM STRONG I NEED THE WALK SAID DOROTHEA RISING WITHANIMATION IN HER FACE
 MRS
 LYDGATE AND I HAVE CHATTED A GREAT DEALAND IT IS TIME FOR ME TO GO
 I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ACCUSED OF BEINGIMMODERATE AND SAYING TOO MUCH
SHE PUT OUT HER HAND TO ROSAMOND AND THEY SAID AN EARNEST QUIETGOODBY WITHOUT KISS OR OTHER SHOW OF EFFUSION THERE HAD BEEN BETWEENTHEM TOO MUCH SERIOUS EMOTION FOR THEM TO USE THE SIGNS OF ITSUPERFICIALLY
AS LYDGATE TOOK HER TO THE DOOR SHE SAID NOTHING OF ROSAMOND BUT TOLDHIM OF MR
 FAREBROTHER AND THE OTHER FRIENDS WHO HAD LISTENED WITHBELIEF TO HIS STORY
WHEN HE CAME BACK TO ROSAMOND SHE HAD ALREADY THROWN HERSELF ON THESOFA IN RESIGNED FATIGUE
WELL ROSY HE SAID STANDING OVER HER AND TOUCHING HER HAIR WHATDO YOU THINK OF MRS
 CASAUBON NOW YOU HAVE SEEN SO MUCH OF HER
I THINK SHE MUST BE BETTER THAN ANY ONE SAID ROSAMOND AND SHE ISVERY BEAUTIFUL
 IF YOU GO TO TALK TO HER SO OFTEN YOU WILL BE MOREDISCONTENTED WITH ME THAN EVER
LYDGATE LAUGHED AT THE SO OFTEN
 BUT HAS SHE MADE YOU ANY LESSDISCONTENTED WITH ME
I THINK SHE HAS SAID ROSAMOND LOOKING UP IN HIS FACE
 HOW HEAVYYOUR EYES ARE TERTIUSAND DO PUSH YOUR HAIR BACK
 HE LIFTED UP HISLARGE WHITE HAND TO OBEY HER AND FELT THANKFUL FOR THIS LITTLE MARK OFINTEREST IN HIM
 POOR ROSAMONDS VAGRANT FANCY HAD COME BACK TERRIBLYSCOURGEDMEEK ENOUGH TO NESTLE UNDER THE OLD DESPISED SHELTER
 AND THESHELTER WAS STILL THERE LYDGATE HAD ACCEPTED HIS NARROWED LOT WITH SADRESIGNATION
 HE HAD CHOSEN THIS FRAGILE CREATURE AND HAD TAKEN THEBURTHEN OF HER LIFE UPON HIS ARMS
 HE MUST WALK AS HE COULD CARRYINGTHAT BURTHEN PITIFULLY
CHAPTER LXXXII
MY GRIEF LIES ONWARD AND MY JOY BEHIND
SHAKESPEARE SONNETS
EXILES NOTORIOUSLY FEED MUCH ON HOPES AND ARE UNLIKELY TO STAY INBANISHMENT UNLESS THEY ARE OBLIGED
 WHEN WILL LADISLAW EXILED HIMSELFFROM MIDDLEMARCH HE HAD PLACED NO STRONGER OBSTACLE TO HIS RETURN THANHIS OWN RESOLVE WHICH WAS BY NO MEANS AN IRON BARRIER BUT SIMPLY ASTATE OF MIND LIABLE TO MELT INTO A MINUET WITH OTHER STATES OF MINDAND TO FIND ITSELF BOWING SMILING AND GIVING PLACE WITH POLITEFACILITY
 AS THE MONTHS WENT ON IT HAD SEEMED MORE AND MORE DIFFICULTTO HIM TO SAY WHY HE SHOULD NOT RUN DOWN TO MIDDLEMARCHMERELY FOR THESAKE OF HEARING SOMETHING ABOUT DOROTHEA AND IF ON SUCH A FLYING VISITHE SHOULD CHANCE BY SOME STRANGE COINCIDENCE TO MEET WITH HER THEREWAS NO REASON FOR HIM TO BE ASHAMED OF HAVING TAKEN AN INNOCENT JOURNEYWHICH HE HAD BEFOREHAND SUPPOSED THAT HE SHOULD NOT TAKE
 SINCE HE WASHOPELESSLY DIVIDED FROM HER HE MIGHT SURELY VENTURE INTO HERNEIGHBORHOOD AND AS TO THE SUSPICIOUS FRIENDS WHO KEPT A DRAGON WATCHOVER HERTHEIR OPINIONS SEEMED LESS AND LESS IMPORTANT WITH TIME ANDCHANGE OF AIR
AND THERE HAD COME A REASON QUITE IRRESPECTIVE OF DOROTHEA WHICHSEEMED TO MAKE A JOURNEY TO MIDDLEMARCH A SORT OF PHILANTHROPIC DUTY
WILL HAD GIVEN A DISINTERESTED ATTENTION TO AN INTENDED SETTLEMENT ON ANEW PLAN IN THE FAR WEST AND THE NEED FOR FUNDS IN ORDER TO CARRY OUTA GOOD DESIGN HAD SET HIM ON DEBATING WITH HIMSELF WHETHER IT WOULD NOTBE A LAUDABLE USE TO MAKE OF HIS CLAIM ON BULSTRODE TO URGE THEAPPLICATION OF THAT MONEY WHICH HAD BEEN OFFERED TO HIMSELF AS A MEANSOF CARRYING OUT A SCHEME LIKELY TO BE LARGELY BENEFICIAL
 THE QUESTIONSEEMED A VERY DUBIOUS ONE TO WILL AND HIS REPUGNANCE TO AGAIN ENTERINGINTO ANY RELATION WITH THE BANKER MIGHT HAVE MADE HIM DISMISS ITQUICKLY IF THERE HAD NOT ARISEN IN HIS IMAGINATION THE PROBABILITYTHAT HIS JUDGMENT MIGHT BE MORE SAFELY DETERMINED BY A VISIT TOMIDDLEMARCH
THAT WAS THE OBJECT WHICH WILL STATED TO HIMSELF AS A REASON FOR COMINGDOWN
 HE HAD MEANT TO CONFIDE IN LYDGATE AND DISCUSS THE MONEYQUESTION WITH HIM AND HE HAD MEANT TO AMUSE HIMSELF FOR THE FEWEVENINGS OF HIS STAY BY HAVING A GREAT DEAL OF MUSIC AND BADINAGE WITHFAIR ROSAMOND WITHOUT NEGLECTING HIS FRIENDS AT LOWICK PARSONAGEIFTHE PARSONAGE WAS CLOSE TO THE MANOR THAT WAS NO FAULT OF HIS
 HE HADNEGLECTED THE FAREBROTHERS BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE FROM A PROUDRESISTANCE TO THE POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INDIRECTLY SEEKING INTERVIEWSWITH DOROTHEA BUT HUNGER TAMES US AND WILL HAD BECOME VERY HUNGRY FORTHE VISION OF A CERTAIN FORM AND THE SOUND OF A CERTAIN VOICE
 NOTHINGHAD DONE INSTEADNOT THE OPERA OR THE CONVERSE OF ZEALOUS POLITICIANSOR THE FLATTERING RECEPTION IN DIM CORNERS OF HIS NEW HAND IN LEADINGARTICLES
THUS HE HAD COME DOWN FORESEEING WITH CONFIDENCE HOW ALMOST EVERYTHINGWOULD BE IN HIS FAMILIAR LITTLE WORLD FEARING INDEED THAT THEREWOULD BE NO SURPRISES IN HIS VISIT
 BUT HE HAD FOUND THAT HUMDRUM WORLDIN A TERRIBLY DYNAMIC CONDITION IN WHICH EVEN BADINAGE AND LYRISM HADTURNED EXPLOSIVE AND THE FIRST DAY OF THIS VISIT HAD BECOME THE MOSTFATAL EPOCH OF HIS LIFE
 THE NEXT MORNING HE FELT SO HARASSED WITH THENIGHTMARE OF CONSEQUENCESHE DREADED SO MUCH THE IMMEDIATE ISSUESBEFORE HIMTHAT SEEING WHILE HE BREAKFASTED THE ARRIVAL OF THERIVERSTON COACH HE WENT OUT HURRIEDLY AND TOOK HIS PLACE ON IT THATHE MIGHT BE RELIEVED AT LEAST FOR A DAY FROM THE NECESSITY OF DOINGOR SAYING ANYTHING IN MIDDLEMARCH
 WILL LADISLAW WAS IN ONE OF THOSETANGLED CRISES WHICH ARE COMMONER IN EXPERIENCE THAN ONE MIGHT IMAGINEFROM THE SHALLOW ABSOLUTENESS OF MENS JUDGMENTS
 HE HAD FOUND LYDGATEFOR WHOM HE HAD THE SINCEREST RESPECT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICHCLAIMED HIS THOROUGH AND FRANKLY DECLARED SYMPATHY AND THE REASON WHYIN SPITE OF THAT CLAIM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR WILL TO HAVEAVOIDED ALL FURTHER INTIMACY OR EVEN CONTACT WITH LYDGATE WASPRECISELY OF THE KIND TO MAKE SUCH A COURSE APPEAR IMPOSSIBLE
 TO ACREATURE OF WILLS SUSCEPTIBLE TEMPERAMENTWITHOUT ANY NEUTRAL REGIONOF INDIFFERENCE IN HIS NATURE READY TO TURN EVERYTHING THAT BEFELL HIMINTO THE COLLISIONS OF A PASSIONATE DRAMATHE REVELATION THAT ROSAMONDHAD MADE HER HAPPINESS IN ANY WAY DEPENDENT ON HIM WAS A DIFFICULTYWHICH HIS OUTBURST OF RAGE TOWARDS HER HAD IMMEASURABLY INCREASED FORHIM
 HE HATED HIS OWN CRUELTY AND YET HE DREADED TO SHOW THE FULNESSOF HIS RELENTING HE MUST GO TO HER AGAIN THE FRIENDSHIP COULD NOT BEPUT TO A SUDDEN END AND HER UNHAPPINESS WAS A POWER WHICH HE DREADED
AND ALL THE WHILE THERE WAS NO MORE FORETASTE OF ENJOYMENT IN THE LIFEBEFORE HIM THAN IF HIS LIMBS HAD BEEN LOPPED OFF AND HE WAS MAKING HISFRESH START ON CRUTCHES
 IN THE NIGHT HE HAD DEBATED WHETHER HE SHOULDNOT GET ON THE COACH NOT FOR RIVERSTON BUT FOR LONDON LEAVING A NOTETO LYDGATE WHICH WOULD GIVE A MAKESHIFT REASON FOR HIS RETREAT
 BUTTHERE WERE STRONG CORDS PULLING HIM BACK FROM THAT ABRUPT DEPARTURETHE BLIGHT ON HIS HAPPINESS IN THINKING OF DOROTHEA THE CRUSHING OFTHAT CHIEF HOPE WHICH HAD REMAINED IN SPITE OF THE ACKNOWLEDGEDNECESSITY FOR RENUNCIATION WAS TOO FRESH A MISERY FOR HIM TO RESIGNHIMSELF TO IT AND GO STRAIGHTWAY INTO A DISTANCE WHICH WAS ALSODESPAIR
THUS HE DID NOTHING MORE DECIDED THAN TAKING THE RIVERSTON COACH
 HECAME BACK AGAIN BY IT WHILE IT WAS STILL DAYLIGHT HAVING MADE UP HISMIND THAT HE MUST GO TO LYDGATES THAT EVENING
 THE RUBICON WE KNOWWAS A VERY INSIGNIFICANT STREAM TO LOOK AT ITS SIGNIFICANCE LAYENTIRELY IN CERTAIN INVISIBLE CONDITIONS
 WILL FELT AS IF HE WEREFORCED TO CROSS HIS SMALL BOUNDARY DITCH AND WHAT HE SAW BEYOND IT WASNOT EMPIRE BUT DISCONTENTED SUBJECTION
BUT IT IS GIVEN TO US SOMETIMES EVEN IN OUR EVERYDAY LIFE TO WITNESSTHE SAVING INFLUENCE OF A NOBLE NATURE THE DIVINE EFFICACY OF RESCUETHAT MAY LIE IN A SELFSUBDUING ACT OF FELLOWSHIP
 IF DOROTHEA AFTERHER NIGHTS ANGUISH HAD NOT TAKEN THAT WALK TO ROSAMONDWHY SHEPERHAPS WOULD HAVE BEEN A WOMAN WHO GAINED A HIGHER CHARACTER FORDISCRETION BUT IT WOULD CERTAINLY NOT HAVE BEEN AS WELL FOR THOSETHREE WHO WERE ON ONE HEARTH IN LYDGATES HOUSE AT HALFPAST SEVEN THATEVENING
ROSAMOND HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR WILLS VISIT AND SHE RECEIVED HIM WITHA LANGUID COLDNESS WHICH LYDGATE ACCOUNTED FOR BY HER NERVOUSEXHAUSTION OF WHICH HE COULD NOT SUPPOSE THAT IT HAD ANY RELATION TOWILL
 AND WHEN SHE SAT IN SILENCE BENDING OVER A BIT OF WORK HEINNOCENTLY APOLOGIZED FOR HER IN AN INDIRECT WAY BY BEGGING HER TO LEANBACKWARD AND REST
 WILL WAS MISERABLE IN THE NECESSITY FOR PLAYING THEPART OF A FRIEND WHO WAS MAKING HIS FIRST APPEARANCE AND GREETING TOROSAMOND WHILE HIS THOUGHTS WERE BUSY ABOUT HER FEELING SINCE THATSCENE OF YESTERDAY WHICH SEEMED STILL INEXORABLY TO ENCLOSE THEM BOTHLIKE THE PAINFUL VISION OF A DOUBLE MADNESS
 IT HAPPENED THAT NOTHINGCALLED LYDGATE OUT OF THE ROOM BUT WHEN ROSAMOND POURED OUT THE TEAAND WILL CAME NEAR TO FETCH IT SHE PLACED A TINY BIT OF FOLDED PAPERIN HIS SAUCER
 HE SAW IT AND SECURED IT QUICKLY BUT AS HE WENT BACK TOHIS INN HE HAD NO EAGERNESS TO UNFOLD THE PAPER
 WHAT ROSAMOND HADWRITTEN TO HIM WOULD PROBABLY DEEPEN THE PAINFUL IMPRESSIONS OF THEEVENING
 STILL HE OPENED AND READ IT BY HIS BEDCANDLE
 THERE WEREONLY THESE FEW WORDS IN HER NEATLY FLOWING HANDI HAVE TOLD MRS
 CASAUBON
 SHE IS NOT UNDER ANY MISTAKE ABOUT YOU
 ITOLD HER BECAUSE SHE CAME TO SEE ME AND WAS VERY KIND
 YOU WILL HAVENOTHING TO REPROACH ME WITH NOW
 I SHALL NOT HAVE MADE ANY DIFFERENCETO YOU
THE EFFECT OF THESE WORDS WAS NOT QUITE ALL GLADNESS
 AS WILL DWELT ONTHEM WITH EXCITED IMAGINATION HE FELT HIS CHEEKS AND EARS BURNING ATTHE THOUGHT OF WHAT HAD OCCURRED BETWEEN DOROTHEA AND ROSAMONDAT THEUNCERTAINTY HOW FAR DOROTHEA MIGHT STILL FEEL HER DIGNITY WOUNDED INHAVING AN EXPLANATION OF HIS CONDUCT OFFERED TO HER
 THERE MIGHT STILLREMAIN IN HER MIND A CHANGED ASSOCIATION WITH HIM WHICH MADE ANIRREMEDIABLE DIFFERENCEA LASTING FLAW
 WITH ACTIVE FANCY HE WROUGHTHIMSELF INTO A STATE OF DOUBT LITTLE MORE EASY THAN THAT OF THE MAN WHOHAS ESCAPED FROM WRECK BY NIGHT AND STANDS ON UNKNOWN GROUND IN THEDARKNESS
 UNTIL THAT WRETCHED YESTERDAYEXCEPT THE MOMENT OF VEXATIONLONG AGO IN THE VERY SAME ROOM AND IN THE VERY SAME PRESENCEALL THEIRVISION ALL THEIR THOUGHT OF EACH OTHER HAD BEEN AS IN A WORLD APARTWHERE THE SUNSHINE FELL ON TALL WHITE LILIES WHERE NO EVIL LURKED ANDNO OTHER SOUL ENTERED
 BUT NOWWOULD DOROTHEA MEET HIM IN THAT WORLDAGAIN
CHAPTER LXXXIII
AND NOW GOODMORROW TO OUR WAKING SOULSWHICH WATCH NOT ONE ANOTHER OUT OF FEARFOR LOVE ALL LOVE OF OTHER SIGHTS CONTROLSAND MAKES ONE LITTLE ROOM AN EVERYWHERE
DR
 DONNE
ON THE SECOND MORNING AFTER DOROTHEAS VISIT TO ROSAMOND SHE HAD HADTWO NIGHTS OF SOUND SLEEP AND HAD NOT ONLY LOST ALL TRACES OF FATIGUEBUT FELT AS IF SHE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF SUPERFLUOUS STRENGTHTHAT IS TOSAY MORE STRENGTH THAN SHE COULD MANAGE TO CONCENTRATE ON ANYOCCUPATION
 THE DAY BEFORE SHE HAD TAKEN LONG WALKS OUTSIDE THEGROUNDS AND HAD PAID TWO VISITS TO THE PARSONAGE BUT SHE NEVER IN HERLIFE TOLD ANY ONE THE REASON WHY SHE SPENT HER TIME IN THAT FRUITLESSMANNER AND THIS MORNING SHE WAS RATHER ANGRY WITH HERSELF FOR HERCHILDISH RESTLESSNESS
 TODAY WAS TO BE SPENT QUITE DIFFERENTLY
 WHATWAS THERE TO BE DONE IN THE VILLAGE
 OH DEAR
 NOTHING
 EVERYBODY WASWELL AND HAD FLANNEL NOBODYS PIG HAD DIED AND IT WAS SATURDAYMORNING WHEN THERE WAS A GENERAL SCRUBBING OF DOORS AND DOORSTONESAND WHEN IT WAS USELESS TO GO INTO THE SCHOOL
 BUT THERE WERE VARIOUSSUBJECTS THAT DOROTHEA WAS TRYING TO GET CLEAR UPON AND SHE RESOLVEDTO THROW HERSELF ENERGETICALLY INTO THE GRAVEST OF ALL
 SHE SAT DOWN INTHE LIBRARY BEFORE HER PARTICULAR LITTLE HEAP OF BOOKS ON POLITICALECONOMY AND KINDRED MATTERS OUT OF WHICH SHE WAS TRYING TO GET LIGHTAS TO THE BEST WAY OF SPENDING MONEY SO AS NOT TO INJURE ONESNEIGHBORS ORWHAT COMES TO THE SAME THINGSO AS TO DO THEM THE MOSTGOOD
 HERE WAS A WEIGHTY SUBJECT WHICH IF SHE COULD BUT LAY HOLD OFIT WOULD CERTAINLY KEEP HER MIND STEADY
 UNHAPPILY HER MIND SLIPPEDOFF IT FOR A WHOLE HOUR AND AT THE END SHE FOUND HERSELF READINGSENTENCES TWICE OVER WITH AN INTENSE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MANY THINGS BUTNOT OF ANY ONE THING CONTAINED IN THE TEXT
 THIS WAS HOPELESS
 SHOULDSHE ORDER THE CARRIAGE AND DRIVE TO TIPTON
 NO FOR SOME REASON OROTHER SHE PREFERRED STAYING AT LOWICK
 BUT HER VAGRANT MIND MUST BEREDUCED TO ORDER THERE WAS AN ART IN SELFDISCIPLINE AND SHE WALKEDROUND AND ROUND THE BROWN LIBRARY CONSIDERING BY WHAT SORT OF MANOEUVRESHE COULD ARREST HER WANDERING THOUGHTS
 PERHAPS A MERE TASK WAS THEBEST MEANSSOMETHING TO WHICH SHE MUST GO DOGGEDLY
 WAS THERE NOT THEGEOGRAPHY OF ASIA MINOR IN WHICH HER SLACKNESS HAD OFTEN BEEN REBUKEDBY MR
 CASAUBON
 SHE WENT TO THE CABINET OF MAPS AND UNROLLED ONE THISMORNING SHE MIGHT MAKE HERSELF FINALLY SURE THAT PAPHLAGONIA WAS NOT ONTHE LEVANTINE COAST AND FIX HER TOTAL DARKNESS ABOUT THE CHALYBESFIRMLY ON THE SHORES OF THE EUXINE
 A MAP WAS A FINE THING TO STUDYWHEN YOU WERE DISPOSED TO THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE BEING MADE UP OFNAMES THAT WOULD TURN INTO A CHIME IF YOU WENT BACK UPON THEM
 DOROTHEASET EARNESTLY TO WORK BENDING CLOSE TO HER MAP AND UTTERING THE NAMESIN AN AUDIBLE SUBDUED TONE WHICH OFTEN GOT INTO A CHIME
 SHE LOOKEDAMUSINGLY GIRLISH AFTER ALL HER DEEP EXPERIENCENODDING HER HEAD ANDMARKING THE NAMES OFF ON HER FINGERS WITH A LITTLE PURSING OF HER LIPAND NOW AND THEN BREAKING OFF TO PUT HER HANDS ON EACH SIDE OF HER FACEAND SAY OH DEAR
 OH DEAR
THERE WAS NO REASON WHY THIS SHOULD END ANY MORE THAN A MERRYGOROUNDBUT IT WAS AT LAST INTERRUPTED BY THE OPENING OF THE DOOR AND THEANNOUNCEMENT OF MISS NOBLE
THE LITTLE OLD LADY WHOSE BONNET HARDLY REACHED DOROTHEAS SHOULDERWAS WARMLY WELCOMED BUT WHILE HER HAND WAS BEING PRESSED SHE MADE MANYOF HER BEAVERLIKE NOISES AS IF SHE HAD SOMETHING DIFFICULT TO SAY
DO SIT DOWN SAID DOROTHEA ROLLING A CHAIR FORWARD
 AM I WANTED FORANYTHING
 I SHALL BE SO GLAD IF I CAN DO ANYTHING
I WILL NOT STAY SAID MISS NOBLE PUTTING HER HAND INTO HER SMALLBASKET AND HOLDING SOME ARTICLE INSIDE IT NERVOUSLY I HAVE LEFT AFRIEND IN THE CHURCHYARD
 SHE LAPSED INTO HER INARTICULATE SOUNDS ANDUNCONSCIOUSLY DREW FORTH THE ARTICLE WHICH SHE WAS FINGERING
 IT WASTHE TORTOISESHELL LOZENGEBOX AND DOROTHEA FELT THE COLOR MOUNTING TOHER CHEEKS
MR
 LADISLAW CONTINUED THE TIMID LITTLE WOMAN
 HE FEARS HE HASOFFENDED YOU AND HAS BEGGED ME TO ASK IF YOU WILL SEE HIM FOR A FEWMINUTES
DOROTHEA DID NOT ANSWER ON THE INSTANT IT WAS CROSSING HER MIND THATSHE COULD NOT RECEIVE HIM IN THIS LIBRARY WHERE HER HUSBANDSPROHIBITION SEEMED TO DWELL
 SHE LOOKED TOWARDS THE WINDOW
 COULD SHEGO OUT AND MEET HIM IN THE GROUNDS
 THE SKY WAS HEAVY AND THE TREESHAD BEGUN TO SHIVER AS AT A COMING STORM
 BESIDES SHE SHRANK FROMGOING OUT TO HIM
DO SEE HIM MRS
 CASAUBON SAID MISS NOBLE PATHETICALLY ELSE IMUST GO BACK AND SAY NO AND THAT WILL HURT HIM
YES I WILL SEE HIM SAID DOROTHEA
 PRAY TELL HIM TO COME
WHAT ELSE WAS THERE TO BE DONE
 THERE WAS NOTHING THAT SHE LONGED FORAT THAT MOMENT EXCEPT TO SEE WILL THE POSSIBILITY OF SEEING HIM HADTHRUST ITSELF INSISTENTLY BETWEEN HER AND EVERY OTHER OBJECT AND YETSHE HAD A THROBBING EXCITEMENT LIKE AN ALARM UPON HERA SENSE THAT SHEWAS DOING SOMETHING DARINGLY DEFIANT FOR HIS SAKE
WHEN THE LITTLE LADY HAD TROTTED AWAY ON HER MISSION DOROTHEA STOOD INTHE MIDDLE OF THE LIBRARY WITH HER HANDS FALLING CLASPED BEFORE HERMAKING NO ATTEMPT TO COMPOSE HERSELF IN AN ATTITUDE OF DIGNIFIEDUNCONSCIOUSNESS
 WHAT SHE WAS LEAST CONSCIOUS OF JUST THEN WAS HER OWNBODY SHE WAS THINKING OF WHAT WAS LIKELY TO BE IN WILLS MIND AND OFTHE HARD FEELINGS THAT OTHERS HAD HAD ABOUT HIM
 HOW COULD ANY DUTYBIND HER TO HARDNESS
 RESISTANCE TO UNJUST DISPRAISE HAD MINGLED WITHHER FEELING FOR HIM FROM THE VERY FIRST AND NOW IN THE REBOUND OF HERHEART AFTER HER ANGUISH THE RESISTANCE WAS STRONGER THAN EVER
 IF ILOVE HIM TOO MUCH IT IS BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN USED SO ILLTHERE WAS AVOICE WITHIN HER SAYING THIS TO SOME IMAGINED AUDIENCE IN THE LIBRARYWHEN THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND SHE SAW WILL BEFORE HER
SHE DID NOT MOVE AND HE CAME TOWARDS HER WITH MORE DOUBT AND TIMIDITYIN HIS FACE THAN SHE HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE
 HE WAS IN A STATE OFUNCERTAINTY WHICH MADE HIM AFRAID LEST SOME LOOK OR WORD OF HIS SHOULDCONDEMN HIM TO A NEW DISTANCE FROM HER AND DOROTHEA WAS AFRAID OF HEROWN EMOTION
 SHE LOOKED AS IF THERE WERE A SPELL UPON HER KEEPINGHER MOTIONLESS AND HINDERING HER FROM UNCLASPING HER HANDS WHILE SOMEINTENSE GRAVE YEARNING WAS IMPRISONED WITHIN HER EYES
 SEEING THAT SHEDID NOT PUT OUT HER HAND AS USUAL WILL PAUSED A YARD FROM HER AND SAIDWITH EMBARRASSMENT I AM SO GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR SEEING ME
I WANTED TO SEE YOU SAID DOROTHEA HAVING NO OTHER WORDS AT COMMAND
IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HER TO SIT DOWN AND WILL DID NOT GIVE A CHEERFULINTERPRETATION TO THIS QUEENLY WAY OF RECEIVING HIM BUT HE WENT ON TOSAY WHAT HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO SAY
I FEAR YOU THINK ME FOOLISH AND PERHAPS WRONG FOR COMING BACK SO SOON
I HAVE BEEN PUNISHED FOR MY IMPATIENCE
 YOU KNOWEVERY ONE KNOWS NOWAPAINFUL STORY ABOUT MY PARENTAGE
 I KNEW OF IT BEFORE I WENT AWAY ANDI ALWAYS MEANT TO TELL YOU OF IT IFIF WE EVER MET AGAIN
THERE WAS A SLIGHT MOVEMENT IN DOROTHEA AND SHE UNCLASPED HER HANDSBUT IMMEDIATELY FOLDED THEM OVER EACH OTHER
BUT THE AFFAIR IS MATTER OF GOSSIP NOW WILL CONTINUED
 I WISHED YOUTO KNOW THAT SOMETHING CONNECTED WITH ITSOMETHING WHICH HAPPENEDBEFORE I WENT AWAY HELPED TO BRING ME DOWN HERE AGAIN
 AT LEAST ITHOUGHT IT EXCUSED MY COMING
 IT WAS THE IDEA OF GETTING BULSTRODE TOAPPLY SOME MONEY TO A PUBLIC PURPOSESOME MONEY WHICH HE HAD THOUGHT OFGIVING ME
 PERHAPS IT IS RATHER TO BULSTRODES CREDIT THAT HE PRIVATELYOFFERED ME COMPENSATION FOR AN OLD INJURY HE OFFERED TO GIVE ME A GOODINCOME TO MAKE AMENDS BUT I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW THE DISAGREEABLE STORY
WILL LOOKED DOUBTFULLY AT DOROTHEA BUT HIS MANNER WAS GATHERING SOMEOF THE DEFIANT COURAGE WITH WHICH HE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF THIS FACT IN HISDESTINY
 HE ADDED YOU KNOW THAT IT MUST BE ALTOGETHER PAINFUL TO ME
YESYESI KNOW SAID DOROTHEA HASTILY
I DID NOT CHOOSE TO ACCEPT AN INCOME FROM SUCH A SOURCE
 I WAS SURETHAT YOU WOULD NOT THINK WELL OF ME IF I DID SO SAID WILL
 WHY SHOULDHE MIND SAYING ANYTHING OF THAT SORT TO HER NOW
 SHE KNEW THAT HE HADAVOWED HIS LOVE FOR HER
 I FELT THATHE BROKE OFF NEVERTHELESS
YOU ACTED AS I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED YOU TO ACT SAID DOROTHEA HERFACE BRIGHTENING AND HER HEAD BECOMING A LITTLE MORE ERECT ON ITSBEAUTIFUL STEM
I DID NOT BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULD LET ANY CIRCUMSTANCE OF MY BIRTHCREATE A PREJUDICE IN YOU AGAINST ME THOUGH IT WAS SURE TO DO SO INOTHERS SAID WILL SHAKING HIS HEAD BACKWARD IN HIS OLD WAY ANDLOOKING WITH A GRAVE APPEAL INTO HER EYES
IF IT WERE A NEW HARDSHIP IT WOULD BE A NEW REASON FOR ME TO CLING TOYOU SAID DOROTHEA FERVIDLY
 NOTHING COULD HAVE CHANGED ME BUT HERHEART WAS SWELLING AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GO ON SHE MADE A GREATEFFORT OVER HERSELF TO SAY IN A LOW TREMULOUS VOICE BUT THINKING THATYOU WERE DIFFERENTNOT SO GOOD AS I HAD BELIEVED YOU TO BE
YOU ARE SURE TO BELIEVE ME BETTER THAN I AM IN EVERYTHING BUT ONESAID WILL GIVING WAY TO HIS OWN FEELING IN THE EVIDENCE OF HERS
 IMEAN IN MY TRUTH TO YOU
 WHEN I THOUGHT YOU DOUBTED OF THAT I DIDNTCARE ABOUT ANYTHING THAT WAS LEFT
 I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL OVER WITH MEAND THERE WAS NOTHING TO TRY FORONLY THINGS TO ENDURE
I DONT DOUBT YOU ANY LONGER SAID DOROTHEA PUTTING OUT HER HAND AVAGUE FEAR FOR HIM IMPELLING HER UNUTTERABLE AFFECTION
HE TOOK HER HAND AND RAISED IT TO HIS LIPS WITH SOMETHING LIKE A SOB
BUT HE STOOD WITH HIS HAT AND GLOVES IN THE OTHER HAND AND MIGHT HAVEDONE FOR THE PORTRAIT OF A ROYALIST
 STILL IT WAS DIFFICULT TO LOOSETHE HAND AND DOROTHEA WITHDRAWING IT IN A CONFUSION THAT DISTRESSEDHER LOOKED AND MOVED AWAY
SEE HOW DARK THE CLOUDS HAVE BECOME AND HOW THE TREES ARE TOSSEDSHE SAID WALKING TOWARDS THE WINDOW YET SPEAKING AND MOVING WITH ONLYA DIM SENSE OF WHAT SHE WAS DOING
WILL FOLLOWED HER AT A LITTLE DISTANCE AND LEANED AGAINST THE TALLBACK OF A LEATHER CHAIR ON WHICH HE VENTURED NOW TO LAY HIS HAT ANDGLOVES AND FREE HIMSELF FROM THE INTOLERABLE DURANCE OF FORMALITY TOWHICH HE HAD BEEN FOR THE FIRST TIME CONDEMNED IN DOROTHEAS PRESENCE
IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT HE FELT VERY HAPPY AT THAT MOMENT LEANING ONTHE CHAIR
 HE WAS NOT MUCH AFRAID OF ANYTHING THAT SHE MIGHT FEEL NOW
THEY STOOD SILENT NOT LOOKING AT EACH OTHER BUT LOOKING AT THEEVERGREENS WHICH WERE BEING TOSSED AND WERE SHOWING THE PALE UNDERSIDEOF THEIR LEAVES AGAINST THE BLACKENING SKY
 WILL NEVER ENJOYED THEPROSPECT OF A STORM SO MUCH IT DELIVERED HIM FROM THE NECESSITY OFGOING AWAY
 LEAVES AND LITTLE BRANCHES WERE HURLED ABOUT AND THETHUNDER WAS GETTING NEARER
 THE LIGHT WAS MORE AND MORE SOMBRE BUTTHERE CAME A FLASH OF LIGHTNING WHICH MADE THEM START AND LOOK AT EACHOTHER AND THEN SMILE
 DOROTHEA BEGAN TO SAY WHAT SHE HAD BEEN THINKINGOF
THAT WAS A WRONG THING FOR YOU TO SAY THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHINGTO TRY FOR
 IF WE HAD LOST OUR OWN CHIEF GOOD OTHER PEOPLES GOODWOULD REMAIN AND THAT IS WORTH TRYING FOR
 SOME CAN BE HAPPY
 I SEEMEDTO SEE THAT MORE CLEARLY THAN EVER WHEN I WAS THE MOST WRETCHED
 I CANHARDLY THINK HOW I COULD HAVE BORNE THE TROUBLE IF THAT FEELING HADNOT COME TO ME TO MAKE STRENGTH
YOU HAVE NEVER FELT THE SORT OF MISERY I FELT SAID WILL THE MISERYOF KNOWING THAT YOU MUST DESPISE ME
BUT I HAVE FELT WORSEIT WAS WORSE TO THINK ILL DOROTHEA HAD BEGUNIMPETUOUSLY BUT BROKE OFF
WILL COLORED
 HE HAD THE SENSE THAT WHATEVER SHE SAID WAS UTTERED INTHE VISION OF A FATALITY THAT KEPT THEM APART
 HE WAS SILENT A MOMENTAND THEN SAID PASSIONATELYWE MAY AT LEAST HAVE THE COMFORT OF SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER WITHOUTDISGUISE
 SINCE I MUST GO AWAYSINCE WE MUST ALWAYS BE DIVIDEDYOU MAYTHINK OF ME AS ONE ON THE BRINK OF THE GRAVE
WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING THERE CAME A VIVID FLASH OF LIGHTNING WHICH LITEACH OF THEM UP FOR THE OTHERAND THE LIGHT SEEMED TO BE THE TERROR OFA HOPELESS LOVE
 DOROTHEA DARTED INSTANTANEOUSLY FROM THE WINDOW WILLFOLLOWED HER SEIZING HER HAND WITH A SPASMODIC MOVEMENT AND SO THEYSTOOD WITH THEIR HANDS CLASPED LIKE TWO CHILDREN LOOKING OUT ON THESTORM WHILE THE THUNDER GAVE A TREMENDOUS CRACK AND ROLL ABOVE THEMAND THE RAIN BEGAN TO POUR DOWN
 THEN THEY TURNED THEIR FACES TOWARDSEACH OTHER WITH THE MEMORY OF HIS LAST WORDS IN THEM AND THEY DID NOTLOOSE EACH OTHERS HANDS
THERE IS NO HOPE FOR ME SAID WILL
 EVEN IF YOU LOVED ME AS WELL ASI LOVE YOUEVEN IF I WERE EVERYTHING TO YOUI SHALL MOST LIKELY ALWAYSBE VERY POOR ON A SOBER CALCULATION ONE CAN COUNT ON NOTHING BUT ACREEPING LOT
 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US EVER TO BELONG TO EACH OTHER
 ITIS PERHAPS BASE OF ME TO HAVE ASKED FOR A WORD FROM YOU
 I MEANT TO GOAWAY INTO SILENCE BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO WHAT I MEANT
DONT BE SORRY SAID DOROTHEA IN HER CLEAR TENDER TONES
 I WOULDRATHER SHARE ALL THE TROUBLE OF OUR PARTING
HER LIPS TREMBLED AND SO DID HIS
 IT WAS NEVER KNOWN WHICH LIPS WERETHE FIRST TO MOVE TOWARDS THE OTHER LIPS BUT THEY KISSED TREMBLINGLYAND THEN THEY MOVED APART
THE RAIN WAS DASHING AGAINST THE WINDOWPANES AS IF AN ANGRY SPIRITWERE WITHIN IT AND BEHIND IT WAS THE GREAT SWOOP OF THE WIND IT WASONE OF THOSE MOMENTS IN WHICH BOTH THE BUSY AND THE IDLE PAUSE WITH ACERTAIN AWE
DOROTHEA SAT DOWN ON THE SEAT NEAREST TO HER A LONG LOW OTTOMAN IN THEMIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND WITH HER HANDS FOLDED OVER EACH OTHER ON HERLAP LOOKED AT THE DREAR OUTER WORLD
 WILL STOOD STILL AN INSTANTLOOKING AT HER THEN SEATED HIMSELF BESIDE HER AND LAID HIS HAND ONHERS WHICH TURNED ITSELF UPWARD TO BE CLASPED
 THEY SAT IN THAT WAYWITHOUT LOOKING AT EACH OTHER UNTIL THE RAIN ABATED AND BEGAN TO FALLIN STILLNESS
 EACH HAD BEEN FULL OF THOUGHTS WHICH NEITHER OF THEMCOULD BEGIN TO UTTER
BUT WHEN THE RAIN WAS QUIET DOROTHEA TURNED TO LOOK AT WILL
 WITHPASSIONATE EXCLAMATION AS IF SOME TORTURE SCREW WERE THREATENING HIMHE STARTED UP AND SAID IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
HE WENT AND LEANED ON THE BACK OF THE CHAIR AGAIN AND SEEMED TO BEBATTLING WITH HIS OWN ANGER WHILE SHE LOOKED TOWARDS HIM SADLY
IT IS AS FATAL AS A MURDER OR ANY OTHER HORROR THAT DIVIDES PEOPLEHE BURST OUT AGAIN IT IS MORE INTOLERABLETO HAVE OUR LIFE MAIMED BYPETTY ACCIDENTS
NODONT SAY THATYOUR LIFE NEED NOT BE MAIMED SAID DOROTHEAGENTLY
YES IT MUST SAID WILL ANGRILY
 IT IS CRUEL OF YOU TO SPEAK INTHAT WAYAS IF THERE WERE ANY COMFORT
 YOU MAY SEE BEYOND THE MISERY OFIT BUT I DONT
 IT IS UNKINDIT IS THROWING BACK MY LOVE FOR YOU AS IFIT WERE A TRIFLE TO SPEAK IN THAT WAY IN THE FACE OF THE FACT
 WE CANNEVER BE MARRIED
SOME TIMEWE MIGHT SAID DOROTHEA IN A TREMBLING VOICE
WHEN
 SAID WILL BITTERLY
 WHAT IS THE USE OF COUNTING ON ANYSUCCESS OF MINE
 IT IS A MERE TOSS UP WHETHER I SHALL EVER DO MORE THANKEEP MYSELF DECENTLY UNLESS I CHOOSE TO SELL MYSELF AS A MERE PEN ANDA MOUTHPIECE
 I CAN SEE THAT CLEARLY ENOUGH
 I COULD NOT OFFER MYSELFTO ANY WOMAN EVEN IF SHE HAD NO LUXURIES TO RENOUNCE
THERE WAS SILENCE
 DOROTHEAS HEART WAS FULL OF SOMETHING THAT SHEWANTED TO SAY AND YET THE WORDS WERE TOO DIFFICULT
 SHE WAS WHOLLYPOSSESSED BY THEM AT THAT MOMENT DEBATE WAS MUTE WITHIN HER
 AND ITWAS VERY HARD THAT SHE COULD NOT SAY WHAT SHE WANTED TO SAY
 WILL WASLOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW ANGRILY
 IF HE WOULD HAVE LOOKED AT HER ANDNOT GONE AWAY FROM HER SIDE SHE THOUGHT EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEENEASIER
 AT LAST HE TURNED STILL RESTING AGAINST THE CHAIR ANDSTRETCHING HIS HAND AUTOMATICALLY TOWARDS HIS HAT SAID WITH A SORT OFEXASPERATION GOODBY
OH I CANNOT BEAR ITMY HEART WILL BREAK SAID DOROTHEA STARTINGFROM HER SEAT THE FLOOD OF HER YOUNG PASSION BEARING DOWN ALL THEOBSTRUCTIONS WHICH HAD KEPT HER SILENTTHE GREAT TEARS RISING ANDFALLING IN AN INSTANT I DONT MIND ABOUT POVERTYI HATE MY WEALTH
IN AN INSTANT WILL WAS CLOSE TO HER AND HAD HIS ARMS ROUND HER BUT SHEDREW HER HEAD BACK AND HELD HIS AWAY GENTLY THAT SHE MIGHT GO ONSPEAKING HER LARGE TEARFILLED EYES LOOKING AT HIS VERY SIMPLY WHILESHE SAID IN A SOBBING CHILDLIKE WAY WE COULD LIVE QUITE WELL ON MYOWN FORTUNEIT IS TOO MUCHSEVEN HUNDRED AYEARI WANT SO LITTLENO NEWCLOTHESAND I WILL LEARN WHAT EVERYTHING COSTS

CADWALLADER SORRY TO SEE HIS GOODNATURED FRIEND SO OVERMASTERED BYANGER
THAT IS NOT SO VERY EASY FOR A MAN OF ANY DIGNITYWITH ANY SENSE OFRIGHTWHEN THE AFFAIR HAPPENS TO BE IN HIS OWN FAMILY SAID SIR JAMESSTILL IN HIS WHITE INDIGNATION
 IT IS PERFECTLY SCANDALOUS
 IFLADISLAW HAD HAD A SPARK OF HONOR HE WOULD HAVE GONE OUT OF THE COUNTRYAT ONCE AND NEVER SHOWN HIS FACE IN IT AGAIN
 HOWEVER I AM NOTSURPRISED
 THE DAY AFTER CASAUBONS FUNERAL I SAID WHAT OUGHT TO BEDONE
 BUT I WAS NOT LISTENED TO
YOU WANTED WHAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE YOU KNOW CHETTAM SAID MR
 BROOKE
YOU WANTED HIM SHIPPED OFF
 I TOLD YOU LADISLAW WAS NOT TO BE DONE ASWE LIKED WITH HE HAD HIS IDEAS
 HE WAS A REMARKABLE FELLOWI ALWAYSSAID HE WAS A REMARKABLE FELLOW
YES SAID SIR JAMES UNABLE TO REPRESS A RETORT IT IS RATHER A PITYYOU FORMED THAT HIGH OPINION OF HIM
 WE ARE INDEBTED TO THAT FOR HISBEING LODGED IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
 WE ARE INDEBTED TO THAT FOR SEEING AWOMAN LIKE DOROTHEA DEGRADING HERSELF BY MARRYING HIM
 SIR JAMES MADELITTLE STOPPAGES BETWEEN HIS CLAUSES THE WORDS NOT COMING EASILY
 AMAN SO MARKED OUT BY HER HUSBANDS WILL THAT DELICACY OUGHT TO HAVEFORBIDDEN HER FROM SEEING HIM AGAINWHO TAKES HER OUT OF HER PROPERRANKINTO POVERTYHAS THE MEANNESS TO ACCEPT SUCH A SACRIFICEHASALWAYS HAD AN OBJECTIONABLE POSITIONA BAD ORIGINAND I BELIEVE ISA MAN OF LITTLE PRINCIPLE AND LIGHT CHARACTER
 THAT IS MY OPINION
 SIRJAMES ENDED EMPHATICALLY TURNING ASIDE AND CROSSING HIS LEG
I POINTED EVERYTHING OUT TO HER SAID MR
 BROOKE APOLOGETICALLYIMEAN THE POVERTY AND ABANDONING HER POSITION
 I SAID MY DEAR YOUDONT KNOW WHAT IT IS TO LIVE ON SEVEN HUNDRED AYEAR AND HAVE NOCARRIAGE AND THAT KIND OF THING AND GO AMONGST PEOPLE WHO DONT KNOWWHO YOU ARE
 I PUT IT STRONGLY TO HER
 BUT I ADVISE YOU TO TALK TODOROTHEA HERSELF
 THE FACT IS SHE HAS A DISLIKE TO CASAUBONSPROPERTY
 YOU WILL HEAR WHAT SHE SAYS YOU KNOW
NOEXCUSE MEI SHALL NOT SAID SIR JAMES WITH MORE COOLNESS
 ICANNOT BEAR TO SEE HER AGAIN IT IS TOO PAINFUL
 IT HURTS ME TOO MUCHTHAT A WOMAN LIKE DOROTHEA SHOULD HAVE DONE WHAT IS WRONG
BE JUST CHETTAM SAID THE EASY LARGELIPPED RECTOR WHO OBJECTED TOALL THIS UNNECESSARY DISCOMFORT
 MRS
 CASAUBON MAY BE ACTINGIMPRUDENTLY SHE IS GIVING UP A FORTUNE FOR THE SAKE OF A MAN AND WEMEN HAVE SO POOR AN OPINION OF EACH OTHER THAT WE CAN HARDLY CALL AWOMAN WISE WHO DOES THAT
 BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD NOT CONDEMN IT AS AWRONG ACTION IN THE STRICT SENSE OF THE WORD
YES I DO ANSWERED SIR JAMES
 I THINK THAT DOROTHEA COMMITS A WRONGACTION IN MARRYING LADISLAW
MY DEAR FELLOW WE ARE RATHER APT TO CONSIDER AN ACT WRONG BECAUSE ITIS UNPLEASANT TO US SAID THE RECTOR QUIETLY
 LIKE MANY MEN WHO TAKELIFE EASILY HE HAD THE KNACK OF SAYING A HOME TRUTH OCCASIONALLY TOTHOSE WHO FELT THEMSELVES VIRTUOUSLY OUT OF TEMPER
 SIR JAMES TOOK OUTHIS HANDKERCHIEF AND BEGAN TO BITE THE CORNER
IT IS VERY DREADFUL OF DODO THOUGH SAID CELIA WISHING TO JUSTIFYHER HUSBAND
 SHE SAID SHE NEVER WOULD MARRY AGAINNOT ANYBODY ATALL
I HEARD HER SAY THE SAME THING MYSELF SAID LADY CHETTAMMAJESTICALLY AS IF THIS WERE ROYAL EVIDENCE
OH THERE IS USUALLY A SILENT EXCEPTION IN SUCH CASES SAID MRS
CADWALLADER
 THE ONLY WONDER TO ME IS THAT ANY OF YOU ARE SURPRISED
YOU DID NOTHING TO HINDER IT
 IF YOU WOULD HAVE HAD LORD TRITON DOWNHERE TO WOO HER WITH HIS PHILANTHROPY HE MIGHT HAVE CARRIED HER OFFBEFORE THE YEAR WAS OVER
 THERE WAS NO SAFETY IN ANYTHING ELSE
 MR
CASAUBON HAD PREPARED ALL THIS AS BEAUTIFULLY AS POSSIBLE
 HE MADEHIMSELF DISAGREEABLEOR IT PLEASED GOD TO MAKE HIM SOAND THEN HE DAREDHER TO CONTRADICT HIM
 ITS THE WAY TO MAKE ANY TRUMPERY TEMPTING TOTICKET IT AT A HIGH PRICE IN THAT WAY
I DONT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY WRONG CADWALLADER SAID SIR JAMESSTILL FEELING A LITTLE STUNG AND TURNING ROUND IN HIS CHAIR TOWARDSTHE RECTOR
 HES NOT A MAN WE CAN TAKE INTO THE FAMILY
 AT LEAST IMUST SPEAK FOR MYSELF HE CONTINUED CAREFULLY KEEPING HIS EYES OFFMR
 BROOKE
 I SUPPOSE OTHERS WILL FIND HIS SOCIETY TOO PLEASANT TOCARE ABOUT THE PROPRIETY OF THE THING
WELL YOU KNOW CHETTAM SAID MR
 BROOKE GOODHUMOREDLY NURSING HISLEG I CANT TURN MY BACK ON DOROTHEA
 I MUST BE A FATHER TO HER UP TOA CERTAIN POINT
 I SAID MY DEAR I WONT REFUSE TO GIVE YOU AWAY
 IHAD SPOKEN STRONGLY BEFORE
 BUT I CAN CUT OFF THE ENTAIL YOU KNOW
 ITWILL COST MONEY AND BE TROUBLESOME BUT I CAN DO IT YOU KNOW
MR
 BROOKE NODDED AT SIR JAMES AND FELT THAT HE WAS BOTH SHOWING HISOWN FORCE OF RESOLUTION AND PROPITIATING WHAT WAS JUST IN THE BARONETSVEXATION
 HE HAD HIT ON A MORE INGENIOUS MODE OF PARRYING THAN HE WASAWARE OF
 HE HAD TOUCHED A MOTIVE OF WHICH SIR JAMES WAS ASHAMED
 THEMASS OF HIS FEELING ABOUT DOROTHEAS MARRIAGE TO LADISLAW WAS DUEPARTLY TO EXCUSABLE PREJUDICE OR EVEN JUSTIFIABLE OPINION PARTLY TO AJEALOUS REPUGNANCE HARDLY LESS IN LADISLAWS CASE THAN IN CASAUBONS
HE WAS CONVINCED THAT THE MARRIAGE WAS A FATAL ONE FOR DOROTHEA
 BUTAMID THAT MASS RAN A VEIN OF WHICH HE WAS TOO GOOD AND HONORABLE A MANTO LIKE THE AVOWAL EVEN TO HIMSELF IT WAS UNDENIABLE THAT THE UNION OFTHE TWO ESTATESTIPTON AND FRESHITTLYING CHARMINGLY WITHIN ARINGFENCE WAS A PROSPECT THAT FLATTERED HIM FOR HIS SON AND HEIR
HENCE WHEN MR
 BROOKE NODDINGLY APPEALED TO THAT MOTIVE SIR JAMES FELTA SUDDEN EMBARRASSMENT THERE WAS A STOPPAGE IN HIS THROAT HE EVENBLUSHED
 HE HAD FOUND MORE WORDS THAN USUAL IN THE FIRST JET OF HISANGER BUT MR
 BROOKES PROPITIATION WAS MORE CLOGGING TO HIS TONGUETHAN MR
 CADWALLADERS CAUSTIC HINT
BUT CELIA WAS GLAD TO HAVE ROOM FOR SPEECH AFTER HER UNCLES SUGGESTIONOF THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY AND SHE SAID THOUGH WITH AS LITTLE EAGERNESSOF MANNER AS IF THE QUESTION HAD TURNED ON AN INVITATION TO DINNER DOYOU MEAN THAT DODO IS GOING TO BE MARRIED DIRECTLY UNCLE
IN THREE WEEKS YOU KNOW SAID MR
 BROOKE HELPLESSLY
 I CAN DONOTHING TO HINDER IT CADWALLADER HE ADDED TURNING FOR A LITTLECOUNTENANCE TOWARD THE RECTOR WHO SAIDI SHOULD NOT MAKE ANY FUSS ABOUT IT
 IF SHE LIKES TO BE POOR THATIS HER AFFAIR
 NOBODY WOULD HAVE SAID ANYTHING IF SHE HAD MARRIED THEYOUNG FELLOW BECAUSE HE WAS RICH
 PLENTY OF BENEFICED CLERGY ARE POORERTHAN THEY WILL BE
 HERE IS ELINOR CONTINUED THE PROVOKING HUSBANDSHE VEXED HER FRIENDS BY ME I HAD HARDLY A THOUSAND AYEARI WAS ALOUTNOBODY COULD SEE ANYTHING IN MEMY SHOES WERE NOT THE RIGHTCUTALL THE MEN WONDERED HOW A WOMAN COULD LIKE ME
 UPON MY WORD IMUST TAKE LADISLAWS PART UNTIL I HEAR MORE HARM OF HIM
HUMPHREY THAT IS ALL SOPHISTRY AND YOU KNOW IT SAID HIS WIFE
EVERYTHING IS ALL ONETHAT IS THE BEGINNING AND END WITH YOU
 AS IFYOU HAD NOT BEEN A CADWALLADER
 DOES ANY ONE SUPPOSE THAT I WOULD HAVETAKEN SUCH A MONSTER AS YOU BY ANY OTHER NAME
AND A CLERGYMAN TOO OBSERVED LADY CHETTAM WITH APPROBATION
 ELINORCANNOT BE SAID TO HAVE DESCENDED BELOW HER RANK
 IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAYWHAT MR
 LADISLAW IS EH JAMES
SIR JAMES GAVE A SMALL GRUNT WHICH WAS LESS RESPECTFUL THAN HIS USUALMODE OF ANSWERING HIS MOTHER
 CELIA LOOKED UP AT HIM LIKE A THOUGHTFULKITTEN
IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT HIS BLOOD IS A FRIGHTFUL MIXTURE
 SAID MRS
CADWALLADER
 THE CASAUBON CUTTLEFISH FLUID TO BEGIN WITH AND THEN AREBELLIOUS POLISH FIDDLER OR DANCINGMASTER WAS IT
AND THEN AN OLDCLONONSENSE ELINOR SAID THE RECTOR RISING
 IT IS TIME FOR US TO GO
AFTER ALL HE IS A PRETTY SPRIG SAID MRS
 CADWALLADER RISING TOOAND WISHING TO MAKE AMENDS
 HE IS LIKE THE FINE OLD CRICHLEY PORTRAITSBEFORE THE IDIOTS CAME IN
ILL GO WITH YOU SAID MR
 BROOKE STARTING UP WITH ALACRITY
 YOUMUST ALL COME AND DINE WITH ME TOMORROW YOU KNOWEH CELIA MY DEAR
YOU WILL JAMESWONT YOU
 SAID CELIA TAKING HER HUSBANDS HAND
OH OF COURSE IF YOU LIKE SAID SIR JAMES PULLING DOWN HISWAISTCOAT BUT UNABLE YET TO ADJUST HIS FACE GOODHUMOREDLY
 THAT ISTO SAY IF IT IS NOT TO MEET ANYBODY ELSE
NO NO NO SAID MR
 BROOKE UNDERSTANDING THE CONDITION
 DOROTHEAWOULD NOT COME YOU KNOW UNLESS YOU HAD BEEN TO SEE HER
WHEN SIR JAMES AND CELIA WERE ALONE SHE SAID DO YOU MIND ABOUT MYHAVING THE CARRIAGE TO GO TO LOWICK JAMES
WHAT NOW DIRECTLY
 HE ANSWERED WITH SOME SURPRISE
YES IT IS VERY IMPORTANT SAID CELIA
REMEMBER CELIA I CANNOT SEE HER SAID SIR JAMES
NOT IF SHE GAVE UP MARRYING
WHAT IS THE USE OF SAYING THAT
HOWEVER IM GOING TO THE STABLES
ILL TELL BRIGGS TO BRING THE CARRIAGE ROUND
CELIA THOUGHT IT WAS OF GREAT USE IF NOT TO SAY THAT AT LEAST TO TAKEA JOURNEY TO LOWICK IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE DOROTHEAS MIND
 ALL THROUGHTHEIR GIRLHOOD SHE HAD FELT THAT SHE COULD ACT ON HER SISTER BY A WORDJUDICIOUSLY PLACEDBY OPENING A LITTLE WINDOW FOR THE DAYLIGHT OF HEROWN UNDERSTANDING TO ENTER AMONG THE STRANGE COLORED LAMPS BY WHICHDODO HABITUALLY SAW
 AND CELIA THE MATRON NATURALLY FELT MORE ABLE TOADVISE HER CHILDLESS SISTER
 HOW COULD ANY ONE UNDERSTAND DODO SO WELLAS CELIA DID OR LOVE HER SO TENDERLY
DOROTHEA BUSY IN HER BOUDOIR FELT A GLOW OF PLEASURE AT THE SIGHT OFHER SISTER SO SOON AFTER THE REVELATION OF HER INTENDED MARRIAGE
 SHEHAD PREFIGURED TO HERSELF EVEN WITH EXAGGERATION THE DISGUST OF HERFRIENDS AND SHE HAD EVEN FEARED THAT CELIA MIGHT BE KEPT ALOOF FROMHER
O KITTY I AM DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU
 SAID DOROTHEA PUTTING HER HANDSON CELIAS SHOULDERS AND BEAMING ON HER
 I ALMOST THOUGHT YOU WOULDNOT COME TO ME
I HAVE NOT BROUGHT ARTHUR BECAUSE I WAS IN A HURRY SAID CELIA ANDTHEY SAT DOWN ON TWO SMALL CHAIRS OPPOSITE EACH OTHER WITH THEIR KNEESTOUCHING
YOU KNOW DODO IT IS VERY BAD SAID CELIA IN HER PLACID GUTTURALLOOKING AS PRETTILY FREE FROM HUMORS AS POSSIBLE
 YOU HAVEDISAPPOINTED US ALL SO
 AND I CANT THINK THAT IT EVER WILL BEYOUNEVER CAN GO AND LIVE IN THAT WAY
 AND THEN THERE ARE ALL YOUR PLANS
YOU NEVER CAN HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT
 JAMES WOULD HAVE TAKEN ANY TROUBLEFOR YOU AND YOU MIGHT HAVE GONE ON ALL YOUR LIFE DOING WHAT YOULIKED
ON THE CONTRARY DEAR SAID DOROTHEA I NEVER COULD DO ANYTHING THATI LIKED
 I HAVE NEVER CARRIED OUT ANY PLAN YET
BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS WANTED THINGS THAT WOULDNT DO
 BUT OTHER PLANSWOULD HAVE COME
 AND HOW CAN YOU MARRY MR
 LADISLAW THAT WE NONE OFUS EVER THOUGHT YOU COULD MARRY
 IT SHOCKS JAMES SO DREADFULLY
 ANDTHEN IT IS ALL SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
 YOU WOULDHAVE MR
 CASAUBON BECAUSE HE HAD SUCH A GREAT SOUL AND WAS SO OLD ANDDISMAL AND LEARNED AND NOW TO THINK OF MARRYING MR
 LADISLAW WHO HASGOT NO ESTATE OR ANYTHING
 I SUPPOSE IT IS BECAUSE YOU MUST BE MAKINGYOURSELF UNCOMFORTABLE IN SOME WAY OR OTHER
DOROTHEA LAUGHED
WELL IT IS VERY SERIOUS DODO SAID CELIA BECOMING MORE IMPRESSIVE
HOW WILL YOU LIVE
 AND YOU WILL GO AWAY AMONG QUEER PEOPLE
 AND ISHALL NEVER SEE YOUAND YOU WONT MIND ABOUT LITTLE ARTHURAND ITHOUGHT YOU ALWAYS WOULDCELIAS RARE TEARS HAD GOT INTO HER EYES AND THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTHWERE AGITATED
DEAR CELIA SAID DOROTHEA WITH TENDER GRAVITY IF YOU DONT EVERSEE ME IT WILL NOT BE MY FAULT
YES IT WILL SAID CELIA WITH THE SAME TOUCHING DISTORTION OF HERSMALL FEATURES
 HOW CAN I COME TO YOU OR HAVE YOU WITH ME WHEN JAMESCANT BEAR IT
THAT IS BECAUSE HE THINKS IT IS NOT RIGHTHE THINKS YOUARE SO WRONG DODO
 BUT YOU ALWAYS WERE WRONG ONLY I CANT HELP LOVINGYOU
 AND NOBODY CAN THINK WHERE YOU WILL LIVE WHERE CAN YOU GO
I AM GOING TO LONDON SAID DOROTHEA
HOW CAN YOU ALWAYS LIVE IN A STREET
 AND YOU WILL BE SO POOR
 I COULDGIVE YOU HALF MY THINGS ONLY HOW CAN I WHEN I NEVER SEE YOU
BLESS YOU KITTY SAID DOROTHEA WITH GENTLE WARMTH
 TAKE COMFORTPERHAPS JAMES WILL FORGIVE ME SOME TIME
BUT IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF YOU WOULD NOT BE MARRIED SAID CELIADRYING HER EYES AND RETURNING TO HER ARGUMENT THEN THERE WOULD BENOTHING UNCOMFORTABLE
 AND YOU WOULD NOT DO WHAT NOBODY THOUGHT YOUCOULD DO
 JAMES ALWAYS SAID YOU OUGHT TO BE A QUEEN BUT THIS IS NOT ATALL BEING LIKE A QUEEN
 YOU KNOW WHAT MISTAKES YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEENMAKING DODO AND THIS IS ANOTHER
 NOBODY THINKS MR
 LADISLAW A PROPERHUSBAND FOR YOU
 AND YOU SAID YOU WOULD NEVER BE MARRIED AGAIN
IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT I MIGHT BE A WISER PERSON CELIA SAIDDOROTHEA AND THAT I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING BETTER IF I HAD BEENBETTER
 BUT THIS IS WHAT I AM GOING TO DO
 I HAVE PROMISED TO MARRY MR
LADISLAW AND I AM GOING TO MARRY HIM
THE TONE IN WHICH DOROTHEA SAID THIS WAS A NOTE THAT CELIA HAD LONGLEARNED TO RECOGNIZE
 SHE WAS SILENT A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN SAID ASIF SHE HAD DISMISSED ALL CONTEST IS HE VERY FOND OF YOU DODO
I HOPE SO
 I AM VERY FOND OF HIM
THAT IS NICE SAID CELIA COMFORTABLY
 ONLY I WOULD RATHER YOU HADSUCH A SORT OF HUSBAND AS JAMES IS WITH A PLACE VERY NEAR THAT ICOULD DRIVE TO
DOROTHEA SMILED AND CELIA LOOKED RATHER MEDITATIVE
 PRESENTLY SHESAID I CANNOT THINK HOW IT ALL CAME ABOUT
 CELIA THOUGHT IT WOULD BEPLEASANT TO HEAR THE STORY
I DARE SAY NOT SAID DOROTHEA PINCHING HER SISTERS CHIN
 IF YOUKNEW HOW IT CAME ABOUT IT WOULD NOT SEEM WONDERFUL TO YOU
CANT YOU TELL ME
 SAID CELIA SETTLING HER ARMS COZILY
NO DEAR YOU WOULD HAVE TO FEEL WITH ME ELSE YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW

 THEN SAID MR

 THEN SAID MR
 IMPLACABLE MIGHTI HAVE ALL THE WORLD GIVEN ME I COULD NOT BE RECONCILED TO HIMTHEREFORE LET US FORTHWITH BRING HIM IN GUILTY OF DEATH
PILGRIMSPROGRESS
WHEN IMMORTAL BUNYAN MAKES HIS PICTURE OF THE PERSECUTING PASSIONSBRINGING IN THEIR VERDICT OF GUILTY WHO PITIES FAITHFUL
 THAT IS ARARE AND BLESSED LOT WHICH SOME GREATEST MEN HAVE NOT ATTAINED TO KNOWOURSELVES GUILTLESS BEFORE A CONDEMNING CROWDTO BE SURE THAT WHAT WEARE DENOUNCED FOR IS SOLELY THE GOOD IN US
 THE PITIABLE LOT IS THAT OFTHE MAN WHO COULD NOT CALL HIMSELF A MARTYR EVEN THOUGH HE WERE TOPERSUADE HIMSELF THAT THE MEN WHO STONED HIM WERE BUT UGLY PASSIONSINCARNATEWHO KNOWS THAT HE IS STONED NOT FOR PROFESSING THE RIGHTBUT FOR NOT BEING THE MAN HE PROFESSED TO BE
THIS WAS THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT BULSTRODE WAS WITHERING UNDER WHILE HEMADE HIS PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTING FROM MIDDLEMARCH AND GOING TO ENDHIS STRICKEN LIFE IN THAT SAD REFUGE THE INDIFFERENCE OF NEW FACES
THE DUTEOUS MERCIFUL CONSTANCY OF HIS WIFE HAD DELIVERED HIM FROM ONEDREAD BUT IT COULD NOT HINDER HER PRESENCE FROM BEING STILL A TRIBUNALBEFORE WHICH HE SHRANK FROM CONFESSION AND DESIRED ADVOCACY
 HISEQUIVOCATIONS WITH HIMSELF ABOUT THE DEATH OF RAFFLES HAD SUSTAINED THECONCEPTION OF AN OMNISCIENCE WHOM HE PRAYED TO YET HE HAD A TERRORUPON HIM WHICH WOULD NOT LET HIM EXPOSE THEM TO JUDGMENT BY A FULLCONFESSION TO HIS WIFE THE ACTS WHICH HE HAD WASHED AND DILUTED WITHINWARD ARGUMENT AND MOTIVE AND FOR WHICH IT SEEMED COMPARATIVELY EASYTO WIN INVISIBLE PARDONWHAT NAME WOULD SHE CALL THEM BY
 THAT SHESHOULD EVER SILENTLY CALL HIS ACTS MURDER WAS WHAT HE COULD NOT BEAR
HE FELT SHROUDED BY HER DOUBT HE GOT STRENGTH TO FACE HER FROM THESENSE THAT SHE COULD NOT YET FEEL WARRANTED IN PRONOUNCING THAT WORSTCONDEMNATION ON HIM
 SOME TIME PERHAPSWHEN HE WAS DYINGHE WOULD TELLHER ALL IN THE DEEP SHADOW OF THAT TIME WHEN SHE HELD HIS HAND IN THEGATHERING DARKNESS SHE MIGHT LISTEN WITHOUT RECOILING FROM HIS TOUCH
PERHAPS BUT CONCEALMENT HAD BEEN THE HABIT OF HIS LIFE AND THEIMPULSE TO CONFESSION HAD NO POWER AGAINST THE DREAD OF A DEEPERHUMILIATION
HE WAS FULL OF TIMID CARE FOR HIS WIFE NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE DEPRECATEDANY HARSHNESS OF JUDGMENT FROM HER BUT BECAUSE HE FELT A DEEP DISTRESSAT THE SIGHT OF HER SUFFERING
 SHE HAD SENT HER DAUGHTERS AWAY TO BOARDAT A SCHOOL ON THE COAST THAT THIS CRISIS MIGHT BE HIDDEN FROM THEM ASFAR AS POSSIBLE
 SET FREE BY THEIR ABSENCE FROM THE INTOLERABLENECESSITY OF ACCOUNTING FOR HER GRIEF OR OF BEHOLDING THEIR FRIGHTENEDWONDER SHE COULD LIVE UNCONSTRAINEDLY WITH THE SORROW THAT WAS EVERYDAY STREAKING HER HAIR WITH WHITENESS AND MAKING HER EYELIDS LANGUID
TELL ME ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ME DO HARRIETBULSTRODE HAD SAID TO HER I MEAN WITH REGARD TO ARRANGEMENTS OFPROPERTY
 IT IS MY INTENTION NOT TO SELL THE LAND I POSSESS IN THISNEIGHBORHOOD BUT TO LEAVE IT TO YOU AS A SAFE PROVISION
 IF YOU HAVEANY WISH ON SUCH SUBJECTS DO NOT CONCEAL IT FROM ME
A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE HAD RETURNED FROM A VISIT TO HERBROTHERS SHE BEGAN TO SPEAK TO HER HUSBAND ON A SUBJECT WHICH HAD FORSOME TIME BEEN IN HER MIND
I SHOULD LIKE TO DO SOMETHING FOR MY BROTHERS FAMILY NICHOLAS ANDI THINK WE ARE BOUND TO MAKE SOME AMENDS TO ROSAMOND AND HER HUSBAND
WALTER SAYS MR
 LYDGATE MUST LEAVE THE TOWN AND HIS PRACTICE IS ALMOSTGOOD FOR NOTHING AND THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE LEFT TO SETTLE ANYWHEREWITH
 I WOULD RATHER DO WITHOUT SOMETHING FOR OURSELVES TO MAKE SOMEAMENDS TO MY POOR BROTHERS FAMILY
MRS
 BULSTRODE DID NOT WISH TO GO NEARER TO THE FACTS THAN IN THEPHRASE MAKE SOME AMENDS KNOWING THAT HER HUSBAND MUST UNDERSTANDHER
 HE HAD A PARTICULAR REASON WHICH SHE WAS NOT AWARE OF FORWINCING UNDER HER SUGGESTION
 HE HESITATED BEFORE HE SAIDIT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT YOUR WISH IN THE WAY YOU PROPOSE MYDEAR
 MR
 LYDGATE HAS VIRTUALLY REJECTED ANY FURTHER SERVICE FROM ME
HE HAS RETURNED THE THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH I LENT HIM
 MRS
 CASAUBONADVANCED HIM THE SUM FOR THAT PURPOSE
 HERE IS HIS LETTER
THE LETTER SEEMED TO CUT MRS
 BULSTRODE SEVERELY
 THE MENTION OF MRS
CASAUBONS LOAN SEEMED A REFLECTION OF THAT PUBLIC FEELING WHICH HELDIT A MATTER OF COURSE THAT EVERY ONE WOULD AVOID A CONNECTION WITH HERHUSBAND
 SHE WAS SILENT FOR SOME TIME AND THE TEARS FELL ONE AFTER THEOTHER HER CHIN TREMBLING AS SHE WIPED THEM AWAY
 BULSTRODE SITTINGOPPOSITE TO HER ACHED AT THE SIGHT OF THAT GRIEFWORN FACE WHICH TWOMONTHS BEFORE HAD BEEN BRIGHT AND BLOOMING
 IT HAD AGED TO KEEP SADCOMPANY WITH HIS OWN WITHERED FEATURES
 URGED INTO SOME EFFORT ATCOMFORTING HER HE SAIDTHERE IS ANOTHER MEANS HARRIET BY WHICH I MIGHT DO A SERVICE TO YOURBROTHERS FAMILY IF YOU LIKE TO ACT IN IT
 AND IT WOULD I THINK BEBENEFICIAL TO YOU IT WOULD BE AN ADVANTAGEOUS WAY OF MANAGING THE LANDWHICH I MEAN TO BE YOURS
SHE LOOKED ATTENTIVE
GARTH ONCE THOUGHT OF UNDERTAKING THE MANAGEMENT OF STONE COURT INORDER TO PLACE YOUR NEPHEW FRED THERE
 THE STOCK WAS TO REMAIN AS ITIS AND THEY WERE TO PAY A CERTAIN SHARE OF THE PROFITS INSTEAD OF ANORDINARY RENT
 THAT WOULD BE A DESIRABLE BEGINNING FOR THE YOUNG MANIN CONJUNCTION WITH HIS EMPLOYMENT UNDER GARTH
 WOULD IT BE ASATISFACTION TO YOU
YES IT WOULD SAID MRS
 BULSTRODE WITH SOME RETURN OF ENERGY
 POORWALTER IS SO CAST DOWN I WOULD TRY ANYTHING IN MY POWER TO DO HIM SOMEGOOD BEFORE I GO AWAY
 WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN BROTHER AND SISTER
YOU MUST MAKE THE PROPOSAL TO GARTH YOURSELF HARRIET SAID MR
BULSTRODE NOT LIKING WHAT HE HAD TO SAY BUT DESIRING THE END HE HADIN VIEW FOR OTHER REASONS BESIDES THE CONSOLATION OF HIS WIFE
 YOUMUST STATE TO HIM THAT THE LAND IS VIRTUALLY YOURS AND THAT HE NEEDHAVE NO TRANSACTIONS WITH ME
 COMMUNICATIONS CAN BE MADE THROUGHSTANDISH
 I MENTION THIS BECAUSE GARTH GAVE UP BEING MY AGENT
 I CANPUT INTO YOUR HANDS A PAPER WHICH HE HIMSELF DREW UP STATINGCONDITIONS AND YOU CAN PROPOSE HIS RENEWED ACCEPTANCE OF THEM
 I THINKIT IS NOT UNLIKELY THAT HE WILL ACCEPT WHEN YOU PROPOSE THE THING FORTHE SAKE OF YOUR NEPHEW

VICTOR HUGO LHOMME QUI RIT
MRS
 GARTH HEARING CALEB ENTER THE PASSAGE ABOUT TEATIME OPENED THEPARLORDOOR AND SAID THERE YOU ARE CALEB

MR
 GARTHS MEALS WERE MUCH SUBORDINATED TO BUSINESS
OH YES A GOOD DINNERCOLD MUTTON AND I DONT KNOW WHAT
 WHERE ISMARY
IN THE GARDEN WITH LETTY I THINK
FRED IS NOT COME YET
NO
 ARE YOU GOING OUT AGAIN WITHOUT TAKING TEA CALEB
 SAID MRS
GARTH SEEING THAT HER ABSENTMINDED HUSBAND WAS PUTTING ON AGAIN THEHAT WHICH HE HAD JUST TAKEN OFF
NO NO IM ONLY GOING TO MARY A MINUTE
MARY WAS IN A GRASSY CORNER OF THE GARDEN WHERE THERE WAS A SWINGLOFTILY HUNG BETWEEN TWO PEARTREES
 SHE HAD A PINK KERCHIEF TIED OVERHER HEAD MAKING A LITTLE POKE TO SHADE HER EYES FROM THE LEVELSUNBEAMS WHILE SHE WAS GIVING A GLORIOUS SWING TO LETTY WHO LAUGHEDAND SCREAMED WILDLY
SEEING HER FATHER MARY LEFT THE SWING AND WENT TO MEET HIM PUSHINGBACK THE PINK KERCHIEF AND SMILING AFAR OFF AT HIM WITH THE INVOLUNTARYSMILE OF LOVING PLEASURE
I CAME TO LOOK FOR YOU MARY SAID MR
 GARTH
 LET US WALK ABOUT ABIT
MARY KNEW QUITE WELL THAT HER FATHER HAD SOMETHING PARTICULAR TO SAYHIS EYEBROWS MADE THEIR PATHETIC ANGLE AND THERE WAS A TENDER GRAVITYIN HIS VOICE THESE THINGS HAD BEEN SIGNS TO HER WHEN SHE WAS LETTYSAGE
 SHE PUT HER ARM WITHIN HIS AND THEY TURNED BY THE ROW OFNUTTREES
IT WILL BE A SAD WHILE BEFORE YOU CAN BE MARRIED MARY SAID HERFATHER NOT LOOKING AT HER BUT AT THE END OF THE STICK WHICH HE HELDIN HIS OTHER HAND
NOT A SAD WHILE FATHERI MEAN TO BE MERRY SAID MARY LAUGHINGLY
 IHAVE BEEN SINGLE AND MERRY FOR FOURANDTWENTY YEARS AND MORE ISUPPOSE IT WILL NOT BE QUITE AS LONG AGAIN AS THAT
 THEN AFTER ALITTLE PAUSE SHE SAID MORE GRAVELY BENDING HER FACE BEFORE HERFATHERS IF YOU ARE CONTENTED WITH FRED
CALEB SCREWED UP HIS MOUTH AND TURNED HIS HEAD ASIDE WISELY
NOW FATHER YOU DID PRAISE HIM LAST WEDNESDAY
 YOU SAID HE HAD ANUNCOMMON NOTION OF STOCK AND A GOOD EYE FOR THINGS
DID I
 SAID CALEB RATHER SLYLY
YES I PUT IT ALL DOWN AND THE DATE ANNO DOMINI AND EVERYTHINGSAID MARY
 YOU LIKE THINGS TO BE NEATLY BOOKED
 AND THEN HIS BEHAVIORTO YOU FATHER IS REALLY GOOD HE HAS A DEEP RESPECT FOR YOU AND ITIS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A BETTER TEMPER THAN FRED HAS
AY AY YOU WANT TO COAX ME INTO THINKING HIM A FINE MATCH
NO INDEED FATHER
 I DONT LOVE HIM BECAUSE HE IS A FINE MATCH
WHAT FOR THEN
OH DEAR BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED HIM
 I SHOULD NEVER LIKESCOLDING ANY ONE ELSE SO WELL AND THAT IS A POINT TO BE THOUGHT OF INA HUSBAND
YOUR MIND IS QUITE SETTLED THEN MARY
 SAID CALEB RETURNING TO HISFIRST TONE
 THERES NO OTHER WISH COME INTO IT SINCE THINGS HAVE BEENGOING ON AS THEY HAVE BEEN OF LATE
 CALEB MEANT A GREAT DEAL IN THATVAGUE PHRASE BECAUSE BETTER LATE THAN NEVER
 A WOMAN MUST NOT FORCEHER HEARTSHELL DO A MAN NO GOOD BY THAT
MY FEELINGS HAVE NOT CHANGED FATHER SAID MARY CALMLY
 I SHALL BECONSTANT TO FRED AS LONG AS HE IS CONSTANT TO ME
 I DONT THINK EITHEROF US COULD SPARE THE OTHER OR LIKE ANY ONE ELSE BETTER HOWEVER MUCHWE MIGHT ADMIRE THEM
 IT WOULD MAKE TOO GREAT A DIFFERENCE TO USLIKESEEING ALL THE OLD PLACES ALTERED AND CHANGING THE NAME FOREVERYTHING
 WE MUST WAIT FOR EACH OTHER A LONG WHILE BUT FRED KNOWSTHAT
INSTEAD OF SPEAKING IMMEDIATELY CALEB STOOD STILL AND SCREWED HISSTICK ON THE GRASSY WALK
 THEN HE SAID WITH EMOTION IN HIS VOICEWELL IVE GOT A BIT OF NEWS
 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF FRED GOING TO LIVEAT STONE COURT AND MANAGING THE LAND THERE
HOW CAN THAT EVER BE FATHER
 SAID MARY WONDERINGLY
HE WOULD MANAGE IT FOR HIS AUNT BULSTRODE
 THE POOR WOMAN HAS BEEN TOME BEGGING AND PRAYING
 SHE WANTS TO DO THE LAD GOOD AND IT MIGHT BE AFINE THING FOR HIM
 WITH SAVING HE MIGHT GRADUALLY BUY THE STOCK ANDHE HAS A TURN FOR FARMING
OH FRED WOULD BE SO HAPPY
 IT IS TOO GOOD TO BELIEVE
AH BUT MIND YOU SAID CALEB TURNING HIS HEAD WARNINGLY I MUSTTAKE IT ON MY SHOULDERS AND BE RESPONSIBLE AND SEE AFTEREVERYTHING AND THAT WILL GRIEVE YOUR MOTHER A BIT THOUGH SHE MAYNTSAY SO
 FRED HAD NEED BE CAREFUL
PERHAPS IT IS TOO MUCH FATHER SAID MARY CHECKED IN HER JOY
 THEREWOULD BE NO HAPPINESS IN BRINGING YOU ANY FRESH TROUBLE
NAY NAY WORK IS MY DELIGHT CHILD WHEN IT DOESNT VEX YOUR MOTHER
AND THEN IF YOU AND FRED GET MARRIED HERE CALEBS VOICE SHOOK JUSTPERCEPTIBLY HELL BE STEADY AND SAVING AND YOUVE GOT YOUR MOTHERSCLEVERNESS AND MINE TOO IN A WOMANS SORT OF WAY AND YOULL KEEP HIMIN ORDER
 HELL BE COMING BYANDBY SO I WANTED TO TELL YOU FIRSTBECAUSE I THINK YOUD LIKE TO TELL HIM BY YOURSELF
 AFTER THAT ICOULD TALK IT WELL OVER WITH HIM AND WE COULD GO INTO BUSINESS AND THENATURE OF THINGS
OH YOU DEAR GOOD FATHER
 CRIED MARY PUTTING HER HANDS ROUND HERFATHERS NECK WHILE HE BENT HIS HEAD PLACIDLY WILLING TO BE CARESSED
I WONDER IF ANY OTHER GIRL THINKS HER FATHER THE BEST MAN IN THEWORLD
NONSENSE CHILD YOULL THINK YOUR HUSBAND BETTER
IMPOSSIBLE SAID MARY RELAPSING INTO HER USUAL TONE HUSBANDS AREAN INFERIOR CLASS OF MEN WHO REQUIRE KEEPING IN ORDER
WHEN THEY WERE ENTERING THE HOUSE WITH LETTY WHO HAD RUN TO JOIN THEMMARY SAW FRED AT THE ORCHARDGATE AND WENT TO MEET HIM
WHAT FINE CLOTHES YOU WEAR YOU EXTRAVAGANT YOUTH
 SAID MARY AS FREDSTOOD STILL AND RAISED HIS HAT TO HER WITH PLAYFUL FORMALITY
 YOU ARENOT LEARNING ECONOMY
NOW THAT IS TOO BAD MARY SAID FRED
 JUST LOOK AT THE EDGES OFTHESE COATCUFFS
 IT IS ONLY BY DINT OF GOOD BRUSHING THAT I LOOKRESPECTABLE
 I AM SAVING UP THREE SUITSONE FOR A WEDDINGSUIT
HOW VERY DROLL YOU WILL LOOK
LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN AN OLDFASHIONBOOK
OH NO THEY WILL KEEP TWO YEARS
TWO YEARS
 BE REASONABLE FRED SAID MARY TURNING TO WALK
 DONTENCOURAGE FLATTERING EXPECTATIONS
WHY NOT
 ONE LIVES ON THEM BETTER THAN ON UNFLATTERING ONES
 IF WECANT BE MARRIED IN TWO YEARS THE TRUTH WILL BE QUITE BAD ENOUGH WHENIT COMES
I HAVE HEARD A STORY OF A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO ONCE ENCOURAGEDFLATTERING EXPECTATIONS AND THEY DID HIM HARM
MARY IF YOUVE GOT SOMETHING DISCOURAGING TO TELL ME I SHALL BOLT ISHALL GO INTO THE HOUSE TO MR
 GARTH
 I AM OUT OF SPIRITS
 MY FATHER ISSO CUT UPHOME IS NOT LIKE ITSELF
 I CANT BEAR ANY MORE BAD NEWS
SHOULD YOU CALL IT BAD NEWS TO BE TOLD THAT YOU WERE TO LIVE AT STONECOURT AND MANAGE THE FARM AND BE REMARKABLY PRUDENT AND SAVE MONEYEVERY YEAR TILL ALL THE STOCK AND FURNITURE WERE YOUR OWN AND YOU WEREA DISTINGUISHED AGRICULTURAL CHARACTER AS MR
 BORTHROP TRUMBULLSAYSRATHER STOUT I FEAR AND WITH THE GREEK AND LATIN SADLYWEATHERWORN
YOU DONT MEAN ANYTHING EXCEPT NONSENSE MARY
 SAID FRED COLORINGSLIGHTLY NEVERTHELESS
THAT IS WHAT MY FATHER HAS JUST TOLD ME OF AS WHAT MAY HAPPEN AND HENEVER TALKS NONSENSE SAID MARY LOOKING UP AT FRED NOW WHILE HEGRASPED HER HAND AS THEY WALKED TILL IT RATHER HURT HER BUT SHE WOULDNOT COMPLAIN
OH I COULD BE A TREMENDOUSLY GOOD FELLOW THEN MARY AND WE COULD BEMARRIED DIRECTLY
NOT SO FAST SIR HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT I WOULD NOT RATHER DEFER OURMARRIAGE FOR SOME YEARS
 THAT WOULD LEAVE YOU TIME TO MISBEHAVE ANDTHEN IF I LIKED SOME ONE ELSE BETTER I SHOULD HAVE AN EXCUSE FORJILTING YOU
PRAY DONT JOKE MARY SAID FRED WITH STRONG FEELING
 TELL MESERIOUSLY THAT ALL THIS IS TRUE AND THAT YOU ARE HAPPY BECAUSE OFITBECAUSE YOU LOVE ME BEST
IT IS ALL TRUE FRED AND I AM HAPPY BECAUSE OF ITBECAUSE I LOVE YOUBEST SAID MARY IN A TONE OF OBEDIENT RECITATION
THEY LINGERED ON THE DOORSTEP UNDER THE STEEPROOFED PORCH AND FREDALMOST IN A WHISPER SAIDWHEN WE WERE FIRST ENGAGED WITH THE UMBRELLARING MARY YOU USEDTOTHE SPIRIT OF JOY BEGAN TO LAUGH MORE DECIDEDLY IN MARYS EYES BUT THEFATAL BEN CAME RUNNING TO THE DOOR WITH BROWNIE YAPPING BEHIND HIMAND BOUNCING AGAINST THEM SAIDFRED AND MARY
 ARE YOU EVER COMING IN
OR MAY I EAT YOUR CAKE
FINALE
EVERY LIMIT IS A BEGINNING AS WELL AS AN ENDING
 WHO CAN QUIT YOUNGLIVES AFTER BEING LONG IN COMPANY WITH THEM AND NOT DESIRE TO KNOWWHAT BEFELL THEM IN THEIR AFTERYEARS
 FOR THE FRAGMENT OF A LIFEHOWEVER TYPICAL IS NOT THE SAMPLE OF AN EVEN WEB PROMISES MAY NOT BEKEPT AND AN ARDENT OUTSET MAY BE FOLLOWED BY DECLENSION LATENT POWERSMAY FIND THEIR LONGWAITED OPPORTUNITY A PAST ERROR MAY URGE A GRANDRETRIEVAL
MARRIAGE WHICH HAS BEEN THE BOURNE OF SO MANY NARRATIVES IS STILL AGREAT BEGINNING AS IT WAS TO ADAM AND EVE WHO KEPT THEIR HONEYMOON INEDEN BUT HAD THEIR FIRST LITTLE ONE AMONG THE THORNS AND THISTLES OFTHE WILDERNESS
 IT IS STILL THE BEGINNING OF THE HOME EPICTHE GRADUALCONQUEST OR IRREMEDIABLE LOSS OF THAT COMPLETE UNION WHICH MAKES THEADVANCING YEARS A CLIMAX AND AGE THE HARVEST OF SWEET MEMORIES INCOMMON
SOME SET OUT LIKE CRUSADERS OF OLD WITH A GLORIOUS EQUIPMENT OF HOPEAND ENTHUSIASM AND GET BROKEN BY THE WAY WANTING PATIENCE WITH EACHOTHER AND THE WORLD
ALL WHO HAVE CARED FOR FRED VINCY AND MARY GARTH WILL LIKE TO KNOW THATTHESE TWO MADE NO SUCH FAILURE BUT ACHIEVED A SOLID MUTUAL HAPPINESS
FRED SURPRISED HIS NEIGHBORS IN VARIOUS WAYS
 HE BECAME RATHERDISTINGUISHED IN HIS SIDE OF THE COUNTY AS A THEORETIC AND PRACTICALFARMER AND PRODUCED A WORK ON THE CULTIVATION OF GREEN CROPS AND THEECONOMY OF CATTLEFEEDING WHICH WON HIM HIGH CONGRATULATIONS ATAGRICULTURAL MEETINGS
 IN MIDDLEMARCH ADMIRATION WAS MORE RESERVEDMOST PERSONS THERE WERE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE MERIT OF FREDSAUTHORSHIP WAS DUE TO HIS WIFE SINCE THEY HAD NEVER EXPECTED FREDVINCY TO WRITE ON TURNIPS AND MANGELWURZEL
BUT WHEN MARY WROTE A LITTLE BOOK FOR HER BOYS CALLED STORIES OFGREAT MEN TAKEN FROM PLUTARCH AND HAD IT PRINTED AND PUBLISHED BYGRIPP  CO
 MIDDLEMARCH EVERY ONE IN THE TOWN WAS WILLING TO GIVE THECREDIT OF THIS WORK TO FRED OBSERVING THAT HE HAD BEEN TO THEUNIVERSITY WHERE THE ANCIENTS WERE STUDIED AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACLERGYMAN IF HE HAD CHOSEN
IN THIS WAY IT WAS MADE CLEAR THAT MIDDLEMARCH HAD NEVER BEEN DECEIVEDAND THAT THERE WAS NO NEED TO PRAISE ANYBODY FOR WRITING A BOOK SINCEIT WAS ALWAYS DONE BY SOMEBODY ELSE
MOREOVER FRED REMAINED UNSWERVINGLY STEADY
 SOME YEARS AFTER HISMARRIAGE HE TOLD MARY THAT HIS HAPPINESS WAS HALF OWING TO FAREBROTHERWHO GAVE HIM A STRONG PULLUP AT THE RIGHT MOMENT
 I CANNOT SAY THAT HEWAS NEVER AGAIN MISLED BY HIS HOPEFULNESS THE YIELD OF CROPS OR THEPROFITS OF A CATTLE SALE USUALLY FELL BELOW HIS ESTIMATE AND HE WASALWAYS PRONE TO BELIEVE THAT HE COULD MAKE MONEY BY THE PURCHASE OF AHORSE WHICH TURNED OUT BADLYTHOUGH THIS MARY OBSERVED WAS OF COURSETHE FAULT OF THE HORSE NOT OF FREDS JUDGMENT
 HE KEPT HIS LOVE OFHORSEMANSHIP BUT HE RARELY ALLOWED HIMSELF A DAYS HUNTING AND WHENHE DID SO IT WAS REMARKABLE THAT HE SUBMITTED TO BE LAUGHED AT FORCOWARDLINESS AT THE FENCES SEEMING TO SEE MARY AND THE BOYS SITTING ONTHE FIVEBARRED GATE OR SHOWING THEIR CURLY HEADS BETWEEN HEDGE ANDDITCH
THERE WERE THREE BOYS MARY WAS NOT DISCONTENTED THAT SHE BROUGHT FORTHMENCHILDREN ONLY AND WHEN FRED WISHED TO HAVE A GIRL LIKE HER SHESAID LAUGHINGLY THAT WOULD BE TOO GREAT A TRIAL TO YOUR MOTHER
MRS
 VINCY IN HER DECLINING YEARS AND IN THE DIMINISHED LUSTRE OF HERHOUSEKEEPING WAS MUCH COMFORTED BY HER PERCEPTION THAT TWO AT LEAST OFFREDS BOYS WERE REAL VINCYS AND DID NOT FEATURE THE GARTHS
 BUTMARY SECRETLY REJOICED THAT THE YOUNGEST OF THE THREE WAS VERY MUCHWHAT HER FATHER MUST HAVE BEEN WHEN HE WORE A ROUND JACKET AND SHOWEDA MARVELLOUS NICETY OF AIM IN PLAYING AT MARBLES OR IN THROWING STONESTO BRING DOWN THE MELLOW PEARS
BEN AND LETTY GARTH WHO WERE UNCLE AND AUNT BEFORE THEY WERE WELL INTHEIR TEENS DISPUTED MUCH AS TO WHETHER NEPHEWS OR NIECES WERE MOREDESIRABLE BEN CONTENDING THAT IT WAS CLEAR GIRLS WERE GOOD FOR LESSTHAN BOYS ELSE THEY WOULD NOT BE ALWAYS IN PETTICOATS WHICH SHOWEDHOW LITTLE THEY WERE MEANT FOR WHEREUPON LETTY WHO ARGUED MUCH FROMBOOKS GOT ANGRY IN REPLYING THAT GOD MADE COATS OF SKINS FOR BOTH ADAMAND EVE ALIKEALSO IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT IN THE EAST THE MEN TOO WOREPETTICOATS
 BUT THIS LATTER ARGUMENT OBSCURING THE MAJESTY OF THEFORMER WAS ONE TOO MANY FOR BEN ANSWERED CONTEMPTUOUSLY THE MORESPOONEYS THEY
 AND IMMEDIATELY APPEALED TO HIS MOTHER WHETHER BOYSWERE NOT BETTER THAN GIRLS
 MRS
 GARTH PRONOUNCED THAT BOTH WERE ALIKENAUGHTY BUT THAT BOYS WERE UNDOUBTEDLY STRONGER COULD RUN FASTER ANDTHROW WITH MORE PRECISION TO A GREATER DISTANCE
 WITH THIS ORACULARSENTENCE BEN WAS WELL SATISFIED NOT MINDING THE NAUGHTINESS BUT LETTYTOOK IT ILL HER FEELING OF SUPERIORITY BEING STRONGER THAN HERMUSCLES
FRED NEVER BECAME RICHHIS HOPEFULNESS HAD NOT LED HIM TO EXPECT THATBUT HE GRADUALLY SAVED ENOUGH TO BECOME OWNER OF THE STOCK ANDFURNITURE AT STONE COURT AND THE WORK WHICH MR
 GARTH PUT INTO HISHANDS CARRIED HIM IN PLENTY THROUGH THOSE BAD TIMES WHICH ARE ALWAYSPRESENT WITH FARMERS
 MARY IN HER MATRONLY DAYS BECAME AS SOLID INFIGURE AS HER MOTHER BUT UNLIKE HER GAVE THE BOYS LITTLE FORMALTEACHING SO THAT MRS
 GARTH WAS ALARMED LEST THEY SHOULD NEVER BE WELLGROUNDED IN GRAMMAR AND GEOGRAPHY
 NEVERTHELESS THEY WERE FOUND QUITEFORWARD ENOUGH WHEN THEY WENT TO SCHOOL PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY HADLIKED NOTHING SO WELL AS BEING WITH THEIR MOTHER
 WHEN FRED WAS RIDINGHOME ON WINTER EVENINGS HE HAD A PLEASANT VISION BEFOREHAND OF THEBRIGHT HEARTH IN THE WAINSCOTED PARLOR AND WAS SORRY FOR OTHER MEN WHOCOULD NOT HAVE MARY FOR THEIR WIFE ESPECIALLY FOR MR
 FAREBROTHER
 HEWAS TEN TIMES WORTHIER OF YOU THAN I WAS FRED COULD NOW SAY TO HERMAGNANIMOUSLY
 TO BE SURE HE WAS MARY ANSWERED AND FOR THAT REASONHE COULD DO BETTER WITHOUT ME
 BUT YOUI SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT YOUWOULD HAVE BEENA CURATE IN DEBT FOR HORSEHIRE AND CAMBRICPOCKETHANDKERCHIEFS
ON INQUIRY IT MIGHT POSSIBLY BE FOUND THAT FRED AND MARY STILL INHABITSTONE COURTTHAT THE CREEPING PLANTS STILL CAST THE FOAM OF THEIRBLOSSOMS OVER THE FINE STONEWALL INTO THE FIELD WHERE THE WALNUTTREESSTAND IN STATELY ROWAND THAT ON SUNNY DAYS THE TWO LOVERS WHO WEREFIRST ENGAGED WITH THE UMBRELLARING MAY BE SEEN IN WHITEHAIREDPLACIDITY AT THE OPEN WINDOW FROM WHICH MARY GARTH IN THE DAYS OF OLDPETER FEATHERSTONE HAD OFTEN BEEN ORDERED TO LOOK OUT FOR MR
 LYDGATE
LYDGATES HAIR NEVER BECAME WHITE
 HE DIED WHEN HE WAS ONLY FIFTYLEAVING HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN PROVIDED FOR BY A HEAVY INSURANCE ON HISLIFE
 HE HAD GAINED AN EXCELLENT PRACTICE ALTERNATING ACCORDING TOTHE SEASON BETWEEN LONDON AND A CONTINENTAL BATHINGPLACE HAVINGWRITTEN A TREATISE ON GOUT A DISEASE WHICH HAS A GOOD DEAL OF WEALTHON ITS SIDE
 HIS SKILL WAS RELIED ON BY MANY PAYING PATIENTS BUT HEALWAYS REGARDED HIMSELF AS A FAILURE HE HAD NOT DONE WHAT HE ONCEMEANT TO DO
 HIS ACQUAINTANCES THOUGHT HIM ENVIABLE TO HAVE SO CHARMINGA WIFE AND NOTHING HAPPENED TO SHAKE THEIR OPINION
 ROSAMOND NEVERCOMMITTED A SECOND COMPROMISING INDISCRETION
 SHE SIMPLY CONTINUED TOBE MILD IN HER TEMPER INFLEXIBLE IN HER JUDGMENT DISPOSED TO ADMONISHHER HUSBAND AND ABLE TO FRUSTRATE HIM BY STRATAGEM
 AS THE YEARS WENTON HE OPPOSED HER LESS AND LESS WHENCE ROSAMOND CONCLUDED THAT HE HADLEARNED THE VALUE OF HER OPINION ON THE OTHER HAND SHE HAD A MORETHOROUGH CONVICTION OF HIS TALENTS NOW THAT HE GAINED A GOOD INCOMEAND INSTEAD OF THE THREATENED CAGE IN BRIDE STREET PROVIDED ONE ALLFLOWERS AND GILDING FIT FOR THE BIRD OF PARADISE THAT SHE RESEMBLED
IN BRIEF LYDGATE WAS WHAT IS CALLED A SUCCESSFUL MAN
 BUT HE DIEDPREMATURELY OF DIPHTHERIA AND ROSAMOND AFTERWARDS MARRIED AN ELDERLYAND WEALTHY PHYSICIAN WHO TOOK KINDLY TO HER FOUR CHILDREN
 SHE MADE AVERY PRETTY SHOW WITH HER DAUGHTERS DRIVING OUT IN HER CARRIAGE ANDOFTEN SPOKE OF HER HAPPINESS AS A REWARDSHE DID NOT SAY FOR WHATBUT PROBABLY SHE MEANT THAT IT WAS A REWARD FOR HER PATIENCE WITHTERTIUS WHOSE TEMPER NEVER BECAME FAULTLESS AND TO THE LASTOCCASIONALLY LET SLIP A BITTER SPEECH WHICH WAS MORE MEMORABLE THAN THESIGNS HE MADE OF HIS REPENTANCE
 HE ONCE CALLED HER HIS BASIL PLANTAND WHEN SHE ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION SAID THAT BASIL WAS A PLANTWHICH HAD FLOURISHED WONDERFULLY ON A MURDERED MANS BRAINS
 ROSAMONDHAD A PLACID BUT STRONG ANSWER TO SUCH SPEECHES
 WHY THEN HAD HE CHOSENHER
 IT WAS A PITY HE HAD NOT HAD MRS
 LADISLAW WHOM HE WAS ALWAYSPRAISING AND PLACING ABOVE HER
 AND THUS THE CONVERSATION ENDED WITHTHE ADVANTAGE ON ROSAMONDS SIDE
 BUT IT WOULD BE UNJUST NOT TO TELLTHAT SHE NEVER UTTERED A WORD IN DEPRECIATION OF DOROTHEA KEEPING INRELIGIOUS REMEMBRANCE THE GENEROSITY WHICH HAD COME TO HER AID IN THESHARPEST CRISIS OF HER LIFE
DOROTHEA HERSELF HAD NO DREAMS OF BEING PRAISED ABOVE OTHER WOMENFEELING THAT THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING BETTER WHICH SHE MIGHT HAVEDONE IF SHE HAD ONLY BEEN BETTER AND KNOWN BETTER
 STILL SHE NEVERREPENTED THAT SHE HAD GIVEN UP POSITION AND FORTUNE TO MARRY WILLLADISLAW AND HE WOULD HAVE HELD IT THE GREATEST SHAME AS WELL ASSORROW TO HIM IF SHE HAD REPENTED
 THEY WERE BOUND TO EACH OTHER BY ALOVE STRONGER THAN ANY IMPULSES WHICH COULD HAVE MARRED IT
 NO LIFEWOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO DOROTHEA WHICH WAS NOT FILLED WITH EMOTIONAND SHE HAD NOW A LIFE FILLED ALSO WITH A BENEFICENT ACTIVITY WHICH SHEHAD NOT THE DOUBTFUL PAINS OF DISCOVERING AND MARKING OUT FOR HERSELF
WILL BECAME AN ARDENT PUBLIC MAN WORKING WELL IN THOSE TIMES WHENREFORMS WERE BEGUN WITH A YOUNG HOPEFULNESS OF IMMEDIATE GOOD WHICH HASBEEN MUCH CHECKED IN OUR DAYS AND GETTING AT LAST RETURNED TOPARLIAMENT BY A CONSTITUENCY WHO PAID HIS EXPENSES
 DOROTHEA COULD HAVELIKED NOTHING BETTER SINCE WRONGS EXISTED THAN THAT HER HUSBANDSHOULD BE IN THE THICK OF A STRUGGLE AGAINST THEM AND THAT SHE SHOULDGIVE HIM WIFELY HELP
 MANY WHO KNEW HER THOUGHT IT A PITY THAT SOSUBSTANTIVE AND RARE A CREATURE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABSORBED INTO THE LIFEOF ANOTHER AND BE ONLY KNOWN IN A CERTAIN CIRCLE AS A WIFE AND MOTHER
BUT NO ONE STATED EXACTLY WHAT ELSE THAT WAS IN HER POWER SHE OUGHTRATHER TO HAVE DONENOT EVEN SIR JAMES CHETTAM WHO WENT NO FURTHERTHAN THE NEGATIVE PRESCRIPTION THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE MARRIED WILLLADISLAW
BUT THIS OPINION OF HIS DID NOT CAUSE A LASTING ALIENATION AND THE WAYIN WHICH THE FAMILY WAS MADE WHOLE AGAIN WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF ALLCONCERNED
 MR
 BROOKE COULD NOT RESIST THE PLEASURE OF CORRESPONDINGWITH WILL AND DOROTHEA AND ONE MORNING WHEN HIS PEN HAD BEENREMARKABLY FLUENT ON THE PROSPECTS OF MUNICIPAL REFORM IT RAN OFF INTOAN INVITATION TO THE GRANGE WHICH ONCE WRITTEN COULD NOT BE DONEAWAY WITH AT LESS COST THAN THE SACRIFICE HARDLY TO BE CONCEIVED OFTHE WHOLE VALUABLE LETTER
 DURING THE MONTHS OF THIS CORRESPONDENCE MR
BROOKE HAD CONTINUALLY IN HIS TALK WITH SIR JAMES CHETTAM BEENPRESUPPOSING OR HINTING THAT THE INTENTION OF CUTTING OFF THE ENTAILWAS STILL MAINTAINED AND THE DAY ON WHICH HIS PEN GAVE THE DARINGINVITATION HE WENT TO FRESHITT EXPRESSLY TO INTIMATE THAT HE HAD ASTRONGER SENSE THAN EVER OF THE REASONS FOR TAKING THAT ENERGETIC STEPAS A PRECAUTION AGAINST ANY MIXTURE OF LOW BLOOD IN THE HEIR OF THEBROOKES
BUT THAT MORNING SOMETHING EXCITING HAD HAPPENED AT THE HALL
 A LETTERHAD COME TO CELIA WHICH MADE HER CRY SILENTLY AS SHE READ IT AND WHENSIR JAMES UNUSED TO SEE HER IN TEARS ASKED ANXIOUSLY WHAT WAS THEMATTER SHE BURST OUT IN A WAIL SUCH AS HE HAD NEVER HEARD FROM HERBEFORE
DOROTHEA HAS A LITTLE BOY
 AND YOU WILL NOT LET ME GO AND SEE HER
 ANDI AM SURE SHE WANTS TO SEE ME
 AND SHE WILL NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITHTHE BABYSHE WILL DO WRONG THINGS WITH IT
 AND THEY THOUGHT SHE WOULDDIE
 IT IS VERY DREADFUL
 SUPPOSE IT HAD BEEN ME AND LITTLE ARTHUR ANDDODO HAD BEEN HINDERED FROM COMING TO SEE ME
 I WISH YOU WOULD BE LESSUNKIND JAMES
GOOD HEAVENS CELIA
 SAID SIR JAMES MUCH WROUGHT UPON WHAT DO YOUWISH
 I WILL DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE
 I WILL TAKE YOU TO TOWN TOMORROW IFYOU WISH IT
 AND CELIA DID WISH IT
IT WAS AFTER THIS THAT MR
 BROOKE CAME AND MEETING THE BARONET IN THEGROUNDS BEGAN TO CHAT WITH HIM IN IGNORANCE OF THE NEWS WHICH SIRJAMES FOR SOME REASON DID NOT CARE TO TELL HIM IMMEDIATELY
 BUT WHENTHE ENTAIL WAS TOUCHED ON IN THE USUAL WAY HE SAID MY DEAR SIR ITIS NOT FOR ME TO DICTATE TO YOU BUT FOR MY PART I WOULD LET THATALONE
 I WOULD LET THINGS REMAIN AS THEY ARE
MR
 BROOKE FELT SO MUCH SURPRISED THAT HE DID NOT AT ONCE FIND OUT HOWMUCH HE WAS RELIEVED BY THE SENSE THAT HE WAS NOT EXPECTED TO DOANYTHING IN PARTICULAR
SUCH BEING THE BENT OF CELIAS HEART IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT SIR JAMESSHOULD CONSENT TO A RECONCILIATION WITH DOROTHEA AND HER HUSBAND
 WHEREWOMEN LOVE EACH OTHER MEN LEARN TO SMOTHER THEIR MUTUAL DISLIKE
 SIRJAMES NEVER LIKED LADISLAW AND WILL ALWAYS PREFERRED TO HAVE SIRJAMESS COMPANY MIXED WITH ANOTHER KIND THEY WERE ON A FOOTING OFRECIPROCAL TOLERANCE WHICH WAS MADE QUITE EASY ONLY WHEN DOROTHEA ANDCELIA WERE PRESENT
IT BECAME AN UNDERSTOOD THING THAT MR
 AND MRS
 LADISLAW SHOULD PAY ATLEAST TWO VISITS DURING THE YEAR TO THE GRANGE AND THERE CAMEGRADUALLY A SMALL ROW OF COUSINS AT FRESHITT WHO ENJOYED PLAYING WITHTHE TWO COUSINS VISITING TIPTON AS MUCH AS IF THE BLOOD OF THESECOUSINS HAD BEEN LESS DUBIOUSLY MIXED
MR
 BROOKE LIVED TO A GOOD OLD AGE AND HIS ESTATE WAS INHERITED BYDOROTHEAS SON WHO MIGHT HAVE REPRESENTED MIDDLEMARCH BUT DECLINEDTHINKING THAT HIS OPINIONS HAD LESS CHANCE OF BEING STIFLED IF HEREMAINED OUT OF DOORS
SIR JAMES NEVER CEASED TO REGARD DOROTHEAS SECOND MARRIAGE AS AMISTAKE AND INDEED THIS REMAINED THE TRADITION CONCERNING IT INMIDDLEMARCH WHERE SHE WAS SPOKEN OF TO A YOUNGER GENERATION AS A FINEGIRL WHO MARRIED A SICKLY CLERGYMAN OLD ENOUGH TO BE HER FATHER ANDIN LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER HIS DEATH GAVE UP HER ESTATE TO MARRYHIS COUSINYOUNG ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN HIS SON WITH NO PROPERTY AND NOTWELLBORN
 THOSE WHO HAD NOT SEEN ANYTHING OF DOROTHEA USUALLY OBSERVEDTHAT SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A NICE WOMAN ELSE SHE WOULD NOT HAVEMARRIED EITHER THE ONE OR THE OTHER
CERTAINLY THOSE DETERMINING ACTS OF HER LIFE WERE NOT IDEALLYBEAUTIFUL
 THEY WERE THE MIXED RESULT OF YOUNG AND NOBLE IMPULSESTRUGGLING AMIDST THE CONDITIONS OF AN IMPERFECT SOCIAL STATE IN WHICHGREAT FEELINGS WILL OFTEN TAKE THE ASPECT OF ERROR AND GREAT FAITH THEASPECT OF ILLUSION
 FOR THERE IS NO CREATURE WHOSE INWARD BEING IS SOSTRONG THAT IT IS NOT GREATLY DETERMINED BY WHAT LIES OUTSIDE IT
 A NEWTHERESA WILL HARDLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF REFORMING A CONVENTUALLIFE ANY MORE THAN A NEW ANTIGONE WILL SPEND HER HEROIC PIETY INDARING ALL FOR THE SAKE OF A BROTHERS BURIAL THE MEDIUM IN WHICHTHEIR ARDENT DEEDS TOOK SHAPE IS FOREVER GONE
 BUT WE INSIGNIFICANTPEOPLE WITH OUR DAILY WORDS AND ACTS ARE PREPARING THE LIVES OF MANYDOROTHEAS SOME OF WHICH MAY PRESENT A FAR SADDER SACRIFICE THAN THATOF THE DOROTHEA WHOSE STORY WE KNOW
HER FINELY TOUCHED SPIRIT HAD STILL ITS FINE ISSUES THOUGH THEY WERENOT WIDELY VISIBLE
 HER FULL NATURE LIKE THAT RIVER OF WHICH CYRUSBROKE THE STRENGTH SPENT ITSELF IN CHANNELS WHICH HAD NO GREAT NAME ONTHE EARTH
 BUT THE EFFECT OF HER BEING ON THOSE AROUND HER WASINCALCULABLY DIFFUSIVE FOR THE GROWING GOOD OF THE WORLD IS PARTLYDEPENDENT ON UNHISTORIC ACTS AND THAT THINGS ARE NOT SO ILL WITH YOUAND ME AS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN IS HALF OWING TO THE NUMBER WHO LIVEDFAITHFULLY A HIDDEN LIFE AND REST IN UNVISITED TOMBS
