THE LITTLE PRINCE ANTOINE DE SAINTEXUPERY ANTOINE DE SAINTEXUPERY WHO WAS A FRENCH AUTHOR JOURNALIST AND PILOT WROTE THE LITTLE PRINCE IN  ONE YEAR BEFORE HIS DEATH
 THE LITTLE PRINCE APPEARS TO BE A SIMPLE CHILDRENS TALESOME WOULD SAY THAT IT IS ACTUALLY A PROFOUND AND DEEPLY MOVING TALEWRITTEN IN RIDDLES AND LACED WITH PHILOSOPHY AND POETIC METAPHOR
ONCE WHEN I WAS SIX YEARS OLD I SAW A MAGNIFICENT PICTURE IN A BOOK CALLED TRUE STORIES FROMNATURE ABOUT THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
 IT WAS A PICTURE OF A BOA CONSTRICTOR IN THE ACT OF SWALLOWING ANANIMAL
 HERE IS A COPY OF THE DRAWING
IN THE BOOK IT SAID BOA CONSTRICTORS SWALLOW THEIR PREY WHOLE WITHOUT CHEWING IT
 AFTER THAT THEYARE NOT ABLE TO MOVE AND THEY SLEEP THROUGH THE SIX MONTHS THAT THEY NEED FOR DIGESTION
 IPONDERED DEEPLY THEN OVER THE ADVENTURES OF THE JUNGLE
 AND AFTER SOME WORK WITH A COLOUREDPENCIL I SUCCEEDED IN MAKING MY FIRST DRAWING
 MY DRAWING NUMBER ONE
 IT LOOKED LIKE THISI SHOWED MY MASTERPIECE TO THE GROWNUPS AND ASKED THEM WHETHER THE DRAWING FRIGHTENED THEM
BUT THEY ANSWERED FRIGHTEN
 WHY SHOULD ANY ONE BE FRIGHTENED BY A HAT
 MY DRAWING WAS NOTA PICTURE OF A HAT
 IT WAS A PICTURE OF A BOA CONSTRICTOR DIGESTING AN ELEPHANT
 BUT SINCE THE GROWNUPS WERE NOT ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT I MADE ANOTHER DRAWING I DREW THE INSIDE OF THE BOACONSTRICTOR SO THAT THE GROWNUPS COULD SEE IT CLEARLY
 THEY ALWAYS NEED TO HAVE THINGS EXPLAINED
MY DRAWING NUMBER TWO LOOKED LIKE THISTHE GROWNUPS RESPONSE THIS TIME WAS TO ADVISE ME TO LAY ASIDE MY DRAWINGS OF BOACONSTRICTORS WHETHER FROM THE INSIDE OR THE OUTSIDE AND DEVOTE MYSELF INSTEAD TO GEOGRAPHYHISTORY ARITHMETIC AND GRAMMAR
 THAT IS WHY AT THE AGE OF SIX I GAVE UP WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AMAGNIFICENT CAREER AS A PAINTER
 I HAD BEEN DISHEARTENED BY THE FAILURE OF MY DRAWING NUMBERONE AND MY DRAWING NUMBER TWO
 GROWNUPS NEVER UNDERSTAND ANYTHING BY THEMSELVES AND IT ISTIRESOME FOR CHILDREN TO BE ALWAYS AND FOREVER EXPLAINING THINGS TO THEM
SO THEN I CHOSE ANOTHER PROFESSION AND LEARNED TO PILOT AIRPLANES
 I HAVE FLOWN A LITTLE OVER ALLPARTS OF THE WORLD AND IT IS TRUE THAT GEOGRAPHY HAS BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME
 AT A GLANCE I CANDISTINGUISH CHINA FROM ARIZONA
 IF ONE GETS LOST IN THE NIGHT SUCH KNOWLEDGE IS VALUABLE
 IN THECOURSE OF THIS LIFE I HAVE HAD A GREAT MANY ENCOUNTERS WITH A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEENCONCERNED WITH MATTERS OF CONSEQUENCE
 I HAVE LIVED A GREAT DEAL AMONG GROWNUPS
 I HAVE SEENTHEM INTIMATELY CLOSE AT HAND
 AND THAT HASNT MUCH IMPROVED MY OPINION OF THEM
WHENEVER I MET ONE OF THEM WHO SEEMED TO ME AT ALL CLEARSIGHTED I TRIED THE EXPERIMENT OFSHOWING HIM MY DRAWING NUMBER ONE WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS KEPT
 I WOULD TRY TO FIND OUT SO IF THISWAS A PERSON OF TRUE UNDERSTANDING
 BUT WHOEVER IT WAS HE OR SHE WOULD ALWAYS SAY THAT IS AHAT
 THEN I WOULD NEVER TALK TO THAT PERSON ABOUT BOA CONSTRICTORS OR PRIMEVAL FORESTS OR STARS
 IWOULD BRING MYSELF DOWN TO HIS LEVEL
 I WOULD TALK TO HIM ABOUT BRIDGE AND GOLF AND POLITICS ANDNECKTIES
 AND THE GROWNUP WOULD BE GREATLY PLEASED TO HAVE MET SUCH A SENSIBLE MAN
SO I LIVED MY LIFE ALONE WITHOUT ANYONE THAT I COULD REALLY TALK TO UNTIL I HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH MYPLANE IN THE DESERT OF SAHARA SIX YEARS AGO
 SOMETHING WAS BROKEN IN MY ENGINE
 AND AS I HADWITH ME NEITHER A MECHANIC NOR ANY PASSENGERS I SET MYSELF TO ATTEMPT THE DIFFICULT REPAIRS ALLALONE
 IT WAS A QUESTION OF LIFE OR DEATH FOR ME I HAD SCARCELY ENOUGH DRINKING WATER TO LAST AWEEK
THE FIRST NIGHT THEN I WENT TO SLEEP ON THE SAND A THOUSAND MILES FROM ANY HUMAN HABITATION
 IWAS MORE ISOLATED THAN A SHIPWRECKED SAILOR ON A RAFT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN
 THUS YOU CANIMAGINE MY AMAZEMENT AT SUNRISE WHEN I WAS AWAKENED BY AN ODD LITTLE VOICE
IT SAID IF YOU PLEASE DRAW ME A SHEEP
WHAT
DRAW ME A SHEEP
I JUMPED TO MY FEET COMPLETELY THUNDERSTRUCK
 I BLINKED MY EYES HARD
 I LOOKED CAREFULLY ALLAROUND ME
 AND I SAW A MOST EXTRAORDINARY SMALL PERSON WHO STOOD THERE EXAMINING ME WITHGREAT SERIOUSNESS
 HERE YOU MAY SEE THE BEST PORTRAIT THAT LATER I WAS ABLE TO MAKE OF HIM
 BUTMY DRAWING IS CERTAINLY VERY MUCH LESS CHARMING THAN ITS MODEL
THAT HOWEVER IS NOT MY FAULT
 THE GROWNUPS DISCOURAGED ME IN MY PAINTERS CAREER WHEN I WASSIX YEARS OLD AND I NEVER LEARNED TO DRAW ANYTHING EXCEPT BOAS FROM THE OUTSIDE AND BOAS FROMTHE INSIDE
NOW I STARED AT THIS SUDDEN APPARITION WITH MY EYES FAIRLY STARTING OUT OF MY HEAD INASTONISHMENT
 REMEMBER I HAD CRASHED IN THE DESERT A THOUSAND MILES FROM ANY INHABITED REGION
AND YET MY LITTLE MAN SEEMED NEITHER TO BE STRAYING UNCERTAINLY AMONG THE SANDS NOR TO BEFAINTING FROM FATIGUE OR HUNGER OR THIRST OR FEAR
 NOTHING ABOUT HIM GAVE ANY SUGGESTION OF A CHILDLOST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT A THOUSAND MILES FROM ANY HUMAN HABITATION
WHEN AT LAST I WAS ABLE TO SPEAK I SAID TO HIM BUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
 AND IN ANSWER HEREPEATED VERY SLOWLY AS IF HE WERE SPEAKING OF A MATTER OF GREAT CONSEQUENCEIF YOU PLEASE DRAW ME A SHEEP


WHEN A MYSTERY IS TOO OVERPOWERING ONE DARE NOT DISOBEY
 ABSURD AS IT MIGHT SEEM TO ME ATHOUSAND MILES FROM ANY HUMAN HABITATION AND IN DANGER OF DEATH I TOOK OUT OF MY POCKET A SHEETOF PAPER AND MY FOUNTAIN PEN
 BUT THEN I REMEMBERED HOW MY STUDIES HAD BEEN CONCENTRATED ONGEOGRAPHY HISTORY ARITHMETIC AND GRAMMAR AND I TOLD THE LITTLE CHAP A LITTLE CROSSLY TOO THAT IDID NOT KNOW HOW TO DRAW
 HE ANSWERED ME THAT DOESNT MATTER
 DRAW ME A SHEEP


BUT I HAD NEVER DRAWN A SHEEP
 SO I DREW FOR HIM ONE OF THE TWO PICTURES I HAD DRAWN SO OFTEN
 ITWAS THAT OF THE BOA CONSTRICTOR FROM THE OUTSIDE
 AND I WAS ASTOUNDED TO HEAR THE LITTLE FELLOWGREET IT WITH NO NO NO
 I DO NOT WANT AN ELEPHANT INSIDE A BOA CONSTRICTOR
 A BOA CONSTRICTOR IS AVERY DANGEROUS CREATURE AND AN ELEPHANT IS VERY CUMBERSOME
 WHERE I LIVE EVERYTHING IS VERYSMALL
 WHAT I NEED IS A SHEEP
 DRAW ME A SHEEP
SO THEN I MADE A DRAWING
 HE LOOKED AT IT CAREFULLY THEN HE SAID NO
 THIS SHEEP IS ALREADY VERYSICKLY
 MAKE ME ANOTHER
 SO I MADE ANOTHER DRAWING
 MY FRIEND SMILED GENTLY AND INDULGENTLY
YOU SEE YOURSELF HE SAID THAT THIS IS NOT A SHEEP
 THIS IS A RAM
 IT HAS HORNS
SO THEN I DID MY DRAWING OVER ONCE MORE
 BUT IT WAS REJECTED TOO JUST LIKE THE OTHERS
 THIS ONE ISTOO OLD
 I WANT A SHEEP THAT WILL LIVE A LONG TIME
BY THIS TIME MY PATIENCE WAS EXHAUSTED BECAUSE I WAS IN A HURRY TO START TAKING MY ENGINE APART
SO I TOSSED OFF THIS DRAWING
 AND I THREW OUT AN EXPLANATION WITH IT
THIS IS ONLY HIS BOX
 THE SHEEP YOU ASKED FOR IS INSIDE
I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO SEE A LIGHT BREAK OVER THE FACE OF MY YOUNG JUDGETHAT IS EXACTLY THE WAY I WANTED IT
 DO YOU THINK THAT THIS SHEEP WILL HAVE TO HAVE A GREAT DEAL OFGRASS
WHY
BECAUSE WHERE I LIVE EVERYTHING IS VERY SMALL


THERE WILL SURELY BE ENOUGH GRASS FOR HIM I SAID
IT IS A VERY SMALL SHEEP THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU
HE BENT HIS HEAD OVER THE DRAWING NOT SO SMALL THAT LOOK
 HE HAS GONE TO SLEEP


AND THAT IS HOW I MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE LITTLE PRINCE
IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO LEARN WHERE HE CAME FROM
 THE LITTLE PRINCE WHO ASKED ME SO MANYQUESTIONS NEVER SEEMED TO HEAR THE ONES I ASKED HIM
 IT WAS FROM WORDS DROPPED BY CHANCE THATLITTLE BY LITTLE EVERYTHING WAS REVEALED TO ME
THE FIRST TIME HE SAW MY AIRPLANE FOR INSTANCE I SHALL NOT DRAW MY AIRPLANE THAT WOULD BE MUCHTOO COMPLICATED FOR ME HE ASKED ME WHAT IS THAT OBJECT
THAT IS NOT AN OBJECT
 IT FLIES
 IT IS AN AIRPLANE
 IT IS MY AIRPLANE
 AND I WAS PROUD TO HAVE HIMLEARN THAT I COULD FLY
 HE CRIED OUT THEN WHAT
 YOU DROPPED DOWN FROM THE SKY
YES I ANSWERED MODESTLY
OH
 THAT IS FUNNY
 AND THE LITTLE PRINCE BROKE INTO A LOVELY PEAL OF LAUGHTER WHICH IRRITATED MEVERY MUCH
 I LIKE MY MISFORTUNES TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY
THEN HE ADDED SO YOU TOO COME FROM THE SKY
 WHICH IS YOUR PLANET
 AT THAT MOMENT I CAUGHTA GLEAM OF LIGHT IN THE IMPENETRABLE MYSTERY OF HIS PRESENCE AND I DEMANDED ABRUPTLY DO YOUCOME FROM ANOTHER PLANET
 BUT HE DID NOT REPLY
 HE TOSSED HIS HEAD GENTLY WITHOUT TAKING HISEYES FROM MY PLANE IT IS TRUE THAT ON THAT YOU CANT HAVE COME FROM VERY FAR AWAY


 AND HESANK INTO A REVERIE WHICH LASTED A LONG TIME
 THEN TAKING MY SHEEP OUT OF HIS POCKET HE BURIEDHIMSELF IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF HIS TREASURE
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW MY CURIOSITY WAS AROUSED BY THIS HALFCONFIDENCE ABOUT THE OTHER PLANETS
 IMADE A GREAT EFFORT THEREFORE TO FIND OUT MORE ON THIS SUBJECT
MY LITTLE MAN WHERE DO YOU COME FROM
 WHAT IS THIS WHERE I LIVE OF WHICH YOU SPEAK
 WHEREDO YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR SHEEP
AFTER A REFLECTIVE SILENCE HE ANSWERED THE THING THAT IS SO GOOD ABOUT THE BOX YOU HAVE GIVENME IS THAT AT NIGHT HE CAN USE IT AS HIS HOUSE
THAT IS SO
 AND IF YOU ARE GOOD I WILL GIVE YOU A STRING TOO SO THAT YOU CAN TIE HIM DURING THE DAYAND A POST TO TIE HIM TO
BUT THE LITTLE PRINCE SEEMED SHOCKED BY THIS OFFER TIE HIM
 WHAT A QUEER IDEA
BUT IF YOU DONT TIE HIM I SAID HE WILL WANDER OFF SOMEWHERE AND GET LOST
MY FRIEND BROKE INTO ANOTHER PEAL OF LAUGHTER BUT WHERE DO YOU THINK HE WOULD GO
ANYWHERE
 STRAIGHT AHEAD OF HIM
THEN THE LITTLE PRINCE SAID EARNESTLY THAT DOESNT MATTER
 WHERE I LIVE EVERYTHING IS SO SMALL
AND WITH PERHAPS A HINT OF SADNESS HE ADDED STRAIGHT AHEAD OF HIM NOBODY CAN GO VERY FAR


I HAD THUS LEARNED A SECOND FACT OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THIS WAS THAT THE PLANET THE LITTLE PRINCECAME FROM WAS SCARCELY ANY LARGER THAN A HOUSE
 BUT THAT DID NOT REALLY SURPRISE ME MUCH
 I KNEWVERY WELL THAT IN ADDITION TO THE GREAT PLANETS SUCH AS THE EARTH JUPITER MARS VENUS TO WHICHWE HAVE GIVEN NAMES THERE ARE ALSO HUNDREDS OF OTHERS SOME OF WHICH ARE SO SMALL THAT ONE HASA HARD TIME SEEING THEM THROUGH THE TELESCOPE
WHEN AN ASTRONOMER DISCOVERS ONE OF THESE HE DOES NOT GIVE IT A NAME BUT ONLY A NUMBER
 HEMIGHT CALL IT FOR EXAMPLE ASTEROID 
I HAVE SERIOUS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE PLANET FROM WHICH THE LITTLE PRINCE CAME IS THE ASTEROIDKNOWN AS B
 THIS ASTEROID HAS ONLY ONCE BEEN SEEN THROUGH THE TELESCOPE
 THAT WAS BY ATURKISH ASTRONOMER IN 
ON MAKING HIS DISCOVERY THE ASTRONOMER HAD PRESENTED IT TO THE INTERNATIONAL ASTRONOMICALCONGRESS IN A GREAT DEMONSTRATION
 BUT HE WAS IN TURKISH COSTUME AND SO NOBODY WOULD BELIEVEWHAT HE SAID
 GROWNUPS ARE LIKE THAT


FORTUNATELY HOWEVER FOR THE REPUTATION OF ASTEROID B A TURKISH DICTATOR MADE A LAW THAT HISSUBJECTS UNDER PAIN OF DEATH SHOULD CHANGE TO EUROPEAN COSTUME
 SO IN  THE ASTRONOMERGAVE HIS DEMONSTRATION ALL OVER AGAIN DRESSED WITH IMPRESSIVE STYLE AND ELEGANCE
 AND THIS TIMEEVERYBODY ACCEPTED HIS REPORT
IF I HAVE TOLD YOU THESE DETAILS ABOUT THE ASTEROID AND MADE A NOTE OF ITS NUMBER FOR YOU IT IS ONACCOUNT OF THE GROWNUPS AND THEIR WAYS
 WHEN YOU TELL THEM THAT YOU HAVE MADE A NEW FRIENDTHEY NEVER ASK YOU ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ESSENTIAL MATTERS
 THEY NEVER SAY TO YOU WHAT DOES HISVOICE SOUND LIKE
 WHAT GAMES DOES HE LOVE BEST
 DOES HE COLLECT BUTTERFLIES
 INSTEAD THEYDEMAND HOW OLD IS HE
 HOW MANY BROTHERS HAS HE
 HOW MUCH DOES HE WEIGH
 HOW MUCHMONEY DOES HIS FATHER MAKE
ONLY FROM THESE FIGURES DO THEY THINK THEY HAVE LEARNED ANYTHING ABOUT HIM
IF YOU WERE TO SAY TO THE GROWNUPS I SAW A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE MADE OF ROSY BRICK WITH GERANIUMSIN THE WINDOWS AND DOVES ON THE ROOF THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET ANY IDEA OF THAT HOUSE AT ALL
YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY TO THEM I SAW A HOUSE THAT COST  
 THEN THEY WOULD EXCLAIM OHWHAT A PRETTY HOUSE THAT IS
 JUST SO YOU MIGHT SAY TO THEM THE PROOF THAT THE LITTLE PRINCEEXISTED IS THAT HE WAS CHARMING THAT HE LAUGHED AND THAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR A SHEEP
 IF ANYBODYWANTS A SHEEP THAT IS A PROOF THAT HE EXISTS
 AND WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO TO TELL THEM THAT
 THEYWOULD SHRUG THEIR SHOULDERS AND TREAT YOU LIKE A CHILD
 BUT IF YOU SAID TO THEM THE PLANET HECAME FROM IS ASTEROID B THEN THEY WOULD BE CONVINCED AND LEAVE YOU IN PEACE FROM THEIRQUESTIONS
 THEY ARE LIKE THAT
 ONE MUST NOT HOLD IT AGAINST THEM
 CHILDREN SHOULD ALWAYS SHOWGREAT FORBEARANCE TOWARD GROWNUP PEOPLE
 BUT CERTAINLY FOR US WHO UNDERSTAND LIFE FIGURES ARE AMATTER OF INDIFFERENCE
I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO BEGIN THIS STORY IN THE FASHION OF THE FAIRYTALES
 I SHOULD HAVE LIKE TO SAYONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A LITTLE PRINCE WHO LIVED ON A PLANET THAT WAS SCARCELY ANY BIGGERTHAN HIMSELF AND WHO HAD NEED OF A SHEEP


TO THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND LIFE THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN A MUCH GREATER AIR OF TRUTH TO MY STORY
 FORIDO NOT WANT ANY ONE TO READ MY BOOK CARELESSLY
 I HAVE SUFFERED TOO MUCH GRIEF IN SETTING DOWNTHESE MEMORIES
 SIX YEARS HAVE ALREADY PASSED SINCE MY FRIEND WENT AWAY FROM ME WITH HISSHEEP
 IF I TRY TO DESCRIBE HIM HERE IT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT I SHALL NOT FORGET HIM
 TO FORGET A FRIENDIS SAD
 NOT EVERY ONE HAS HAD A FRIEND
 AND IF I FORGET HIM I MAY BECOME LIKE THE GROWNUPS WHOARE NO LONGER INTERESTED IN ANYTHING BUT FIGURES


 IT IS FOR THAT PURPOSE AGAIN THAT I HAVE BOUGHT ABOX OF PAINTS AND SOME PENCILS
IT IS HARD TO TAKE UP DRAWING AGAIN AT MY AGE WHEN I HAVE NEVER MADE ANY PICTURES EXCEPT THOSEOF THE BOA CONSTRICTOR FROM THE OUTSIDE AND THE BOA CONSTRICTOR FROM THE INSIDE SINCE I WAS SIX
 ISHALL CERTAINLY TRY TO MAKE MY PORTRAITS AS TRUE TO LIFE AS POSSIBLE
 BUT I AM NOT AT ALL SURE OFSUCCESS
 ONE DRAWING GOES ALONG ALL RIGHT AND ANOTHER HAS NO RESEMBLANCE TO ITS SUBJECT
 I MAKESOME ERRORS TOO IN THE LITTLE PRINCES HEIGHT IN ONE PLACE HE IS TOO TALL AND IN ANOTHER TOO SHORT
AND I FEEL SOME DOUBTS ABOUT THE COLOUR OF HIS COSTUME
 SO I FUMBLE ALONG AS BEST I CAN NOW GOODNOW BAD AND I HOPE GENERALLY FAIRTO MIDDLING
 IN CERTAIN MORE IMPORTANT DETAILS I SHALL MAKEMISTAKES ALSO
 BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL NOT BE MY FAULT
 MY FRIEND NEVER EXPLAINED ANYTHINGTO ME
 HE THOUGHT PERHAPS THAT I WAS LIKE HIMSELF
 BUT I ALAS DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SEE SHEEPTHROUGH THE WALLS OF BOXES
 PERHAPS I AM A LITTLE LIKE THE GROWNUPS
 I HAVE HAD TO GROW OLD
AS EACH DAY PASSED I WOULD LEARN IN OUR TALK SOMETHING ABOUT THE LITTLE PRINCES PLANET HISDEPARTURE FROM IT HIS JOURNEY
 THE INFORMATION WOULD COME VERY SLOWLY AS IT MIGHT CHANCE TO FALLFROM HIS THOUGHTS
 IT WAS IN THIS WAY THAT I HEARD ON THE THIRD DAY ABOUT THE CATASTROPHE OF THEBAOBABS
THIS TIME ONCE MORE I HAD THE SHEEP TO THANK FOR IT
 FOR THE LITTLE PRINCE ASKED ME ABRUPTLY AS IFSEIZED BY A GRAVE DOUBTIT IS TRUE ISNT IT THAT SHEEP EAT LITTLE BUSHES
YES THAT IS TRUE
 AH
 I AM GLAD
 I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT SHEEP SHOULD EAT LITTLE BUSHES
 BUT THE LITTLE PRINCE ADDED THEN IT FOLLOWS THAT THEY ALSO EAT BAOBABS
 I POINTED OUT TO THE LITTLE PRINCE THAT BAOBABS WERE NOT LITTLE BUSHES BUT ON THE CONTRARY TREES AS BIG AS CASTLES AND THAT EVEN IF HE TOOK A WHOLE HERD OF ELEPHANTS AWAY WITH HIM THE HERD WOULD NOT EAT UP ONE SINGLE BAOBAB
 THE IDEA OF THE HERD OF ELEPHANTS MADE THE LITTLE PRINCE LAUGH
 WE WOULD HAVE TO PUT THEM ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER HE SAID
 BUT HE MADE A WISE COMMENT BEFORE THEY GROW SO BIG THE BAOBABS START OUT BY BEING LITTLE
 THAT IS STRICTLY CORRECT I SAID
 BUT WHY DO YOU WANT THE SHEEP TO EAT THE LITTLE BAOBABS
 HE ANSWERED ME AT ONCE OH COME COME
 AS IF HE WERE SPEAKING OF SOMETHING THAT WAS SELF EVIDENT
 AND I WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE A GREAT MENTAL EFFORT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE
 INDEED AS I LEARNED THERE WERE ON THE PLANET WHERE THE LITTLE PRINCE LIVED AS ON ALL PLANETS GOOD PLANTS AND BAD PLANTS
 IN CONSEQUENCE THERE WERE GOOD SEEDS FROM GOOD PLANTS AND BAD SEEDS FROM BAD PLANTS
 BUT SEEDS ARE INVISIBLE
 THEY SLEEP DEEP IN THE HEART OF THE EARTHS DARKNESS UNTIL SOME ONE AMONG THEM IS SEIZED WITH THE DESIRE TO AWAKEN
 THEN THIS LITTLE SEED WILL STRETCH ITSELF AND BEGIN TIMIDLY AT FIRST TO PUSH A CHARMING LITTLE SPRIG INOFFENSIVELY UPWARD TOWARD THE SUN
 IF IT IS ONLY A SPROUT OF RADISH OR THE SPRIG OF A ROSEBUSH ONE WOULD LET IT GROW WHEREVER IT MIGHT WISH
 BUT WHEN IT IS A BAD PLANT ONE MUST DESTROY IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE VERY FIRST INSTANT THAT ONE RECOGNISES IT
 NOW THERE WERE SOME TERRIBLE SEEDS ON THE PLANET THAT WAS THE HOME OF THE LITTLE PRINCE AND THESE WERE THE SEEDS OF THE BAOBAB
 THE SOIL OF THAT PLANET WAS INFESTED WITH THEM
 A BAOBAB IS SOMETHING YOU WILL NEVER NEVER BE ABLE TO GET RID OF IF YOU ATTEND TO IT TOO LATE
 IT SPREADS OVER THE ENTIRE PLANET
 IT BORES CLEAR THROUGH IT WITH ITS ROOTS
 AND IF THE PLANET IS TOO SMALL AND THE BAOBABS ARE TOO MANY THEY SPLIT IT IN PIECES


 IT IS A QUESTION OF DISCIPLINE THE LITTLE PRINCE SAID TO ME LATER ON
 WHEN YOUVE FINISHED YOUR OWN TOILET IN THE MORNING THEN IT IS TIME TO ATTEND TO THE TOILET OF YOUR PLANET JUST SO WITH THE GREATEST CARE
 YOU MUST SEE TO IT THAT YOU PULL UP REGULARLY ALL THE BAOBABS AT THE VERY FIRST MOMENT WHEN THEY CAN BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE ROSEBUSHES WHICH THEY RESEMBLE SO CLOSELY IN THEIR EARLIEST YOUTH
 IT IS VERY TEDIOUS WORK THE LITTLE PRINCE ADDED BUT VERY EASY
 AND ONE DAY HE SAID TO ME YOU OUGHT TO MAKE A BEAUTIFUL DRAWING SO THAT THE CHILDREN WHERE YOU LIVE CAN SEE EXACTLY HOW ALL THIS IS
 THAT WOULD BE VERY USEFUL TO THEM IF THEY WERE TO TRAVEL SOME DAY
 SOMETIMES HE ADDED THERE IS NO HARM IN PUTTING OFF A PIECE OF WORK UNTIL ANOTHER DAY
 BUT WHEN IT IS A MATTER OF BAOBABS THAT ALWAYS MEANS A CATASTROPHE
 I KNEW A PLANET THAT WAS INHABITED BY A LAZY MAN
 HE NEGLECTED THREE LITTLE BUSHES


 SO AS THE LITTLE PRINCE DESCRIBED IT TO ME I HAVE MADE A DRAWING OF THAT PLANET
 I DO NOT MUCH LIKE TO TAKE THE TONE OF A MORALIST
 BUT THE DANGER OF THE BAOBABS IS SO LITTLE UNDERSTOOD AND SUCH CONSIDERABLE RISKS WOULD BE RUN BY ANYONE WHO MIGHT GET LOST ON AN ASTEROID THAT FOR ONCE I AM BREAKING THROUGH MY RESERVE
 CHILDREN I SAY PLAINLY WATCH OUT FOR THE BAOBABS
 MY FRIENDS LIKE MYSELF HAVE BEEN SKIRTING THIS DANGER FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT EVER KNOWING IT AND SO IT IS FOR THEM THAT I HAVE WORKED SO HARD OVER THIS DRAWING
 THE LESSON WHICH I PASS ON BY THIS MEANS IS WORTH ALL THE TROUBLE IT HAS COST ME
 PERHAPS YOU WILL ASK ME WHY ARE THERE NO OTHER DRAWING IN THIS BOOK AS MAGNIFICENT AND IMPRESSIVE AS THIS DRAWING OF THE BAOBABS
 THE REPLY IS SIMPLE
 I HAVE TRIED
 BUT WITH THE OTHERS I HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL
 WHEN I MADE THE DRAWING OF THE BAOBABS I WAS CARRIED BEYOND MYSELF BY THE INSPIRING FORCE OF URGENT NECESSITY
 OH LITTLE PRINCE
 BIT BY BIT I CAME TO UNDERSTAND THE SECRETS OF YOUR SAD LITTLE LIFE


 FOR A LONG TIME YOU HAD FOUND YOUR ONLY ENTERTAINMENT IN THE QUIET PLEASURE OF LOOKING AT THE SUNSET
 I LEARNED THAT NEW DETAIL ON THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH DAY WHEN YOU SAID TO ME I AM VERY FOND OF SUNSETS
 COME LET US GO LOOK AT A SUNSET NOW
 BUT WE MUST WAIT I SAID
 WAIT
 FOR WHAT
 FOR THE SUNSET
 WE MUST WAIT UNTIL IT IS TIME
 AT FIRST YOU SEEMED TO BE VERY MUCH SURPRISED
 AND THEN YOU LAUGHED TO YOURSELF
 YOU SAID TO ME I AM ALWAYS THINKING THAT I AM AT HOME
 JUST SO
 EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT WHEN IT IS NOON IN THE UNITED STATES THE SUN IS SETTING OVER FRANCE
 IF YOU COULD FLY TO FRANCE IN ONE MINUTE YOU COULD GO STRAIGHT INTO THE SUNSET RIGHT FROM NOON
 UNFORTUNATELY FRANCE IS TOO FAR AWAY FOR THAT
 BUT ON YOUR TINY PLANET MY LITTLE PRINCE ALL YOU NEED DO IS MOVE YOUR CHAIR A FEW STEPS
 YOU CAN SEE THE DAY END AND THE TWILIGHT FALLING WHENEVER YOU LIKE


 ONE DAY YOU SAID TO ME I SAW THE SUNSET FORTYFOUR TIMES
 AND A LITTLE LATER YOU ADDED YOU KNOW ONE LOVES THE SUNSET WHEN ONE IS SO SAD


 WERE YOU SO SAD THEN
 I ASKED ON THE DAY OF THE FORTYFOUR SUNSETS
 BUT THE LITTLE PRINCE MADE NO REPLY
 ON THE FIFTH DAY AGAIN AS ALWAYS IT WAS THANKS TO THE SHEEP THE SECRET OF THE LITTLE PRINCES LIFE WAS REVEALED TO ME
 ABRUPTLY WITHOUT ANYTHING TO LEAD UP TO IT AND AS IF THE QUESTION HAD BEEN BORN OF LONG AND SILENT MEDITATION ON HIS PROBLEM HE DEMANDED A SHEEP IF IT EATS LITTLE BUSHES DOES IT EAT FLOWERS TOO
 A SHEEP I ANSWERED EATS ANYTHING IT FINDS IN ITS REACH
 EVEN FLOWERS THAT HAVE THORNS
 YES EVEN FLOWERS THAT HAVE THORNS
 THEN THE THORNS WHAT USE ARE THEY
 I DID NOT KNOW
 AT THAT MOMENT I WAS VERY BUSY TRYING TO UNSCREW A BOLT THAT HAD GOT STUCK IN MY ENGINE
 I WAS VERY MUCH WORRIED FOR IT WAS BECOMING CLEAR TO ME THAT THE BREAKDOWN OF MY PLANE WAS EXTREMELY SERIOUS
 AND I HAD SO LITTLE DRINKING WATER LEFT THAT I HAD TO FEAR FOR THE WORST
 THE THORNS WHAT USE ARE THEY
 THE LITTLE PRINCE NEVER LET GO OF A QUESTION ONCE HE HAD ASKED IT
 AS FOR ME I WAS UPSET OVER THAT BOLT
 AND I ANSWERED WITH THE FIRST THING THAT CAME INTO MY HEAD THE THORNS ARE OF NO USE AT ALL
 FLOWERS HAVE THORNS JUST FOR SPITE
 OH
 THERE WAS A MOMENT OF COMPLETE SILENCE
 THEN THE LITTLE PRINCE FLASHED BACK AT ME WITH A KIND OF RESENTFULNESS I DONT BELIEVE YOU
 FLOWERS ARE WEAK CREATURES
 THEY ARE NAIVE
 THEY REASSURE THEMSELVES AS BEST THEY CAN
 THEY BELIEVE THAT THEIR THORNS ARE TERRIBLE WEAPONS


 I DID NOT ANSWER
 AT THAT INSTANT I WAS SAYING TO MYSELF IF THIS BOLT STILL WONT TURN I AM GOING TO KNOCK IT OUT WITH THE HAMMER
 AGAIN THE LITTLE PRINCE DISTURBED MY THOUGHTS
 AND YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THE FLOWERS


 OH NO
 I CRIED
 NO NO NO
 I DONT BELIEVE ANYTHING
 I ANSWERED YOU WITH THE FIRST THING THAT CAME INTO MY HEAD
 DONT YOU SEE I AM VERY BUSY WITH MATTERS OF CONSEQUENCE
 HE STARED AT ME THUNDERSTRUCK
 MATTERS OF CONSEQUENCE
 HE LOOKED AT ME THERE WITH MY HAMMER IN MY HAND MY FINGERS BLACK WITH ENGINE GREASE BENDING DOWN OVER AN OBJECT WHICH SEEMED TO HIM EXTREMELY UGLY


 YOU TALK JUST LIKE THE GROWNUPS
 THAT MADE ME A LITTLE ASHAMED
 BUT HE WENT ON RELENTLESSLY YOU MIX EVERYTHING UP TOGETHER


 YOU CONFUSE EVERYTHING


 HE WAS REALLY VERY ANGRY
 HE TOSSED HIS GOLDEN CURLS IN THE BREEZE
 I KNOW A PLANET WHERE THERE IS A CERTAIN REDFACED GENTLEMAN
 HE HAS NEVER SMELLED A FLOWER
 HE HAS NEVER LOOKED AT A STAR
 HE HAS NEVER LOVED ANY ONE
 HE HAS NEVER DONE ANYTHING IN HIS LIFE BUT ADD UP FIGURES
 AND ALL DAY HE SAYS OVER AND OVER JUST LIKE YOU I AM BUSY WITH MATTERS OF CONSEQUENCE
 AND THAT MAKES HIM SWELL UP WITH PRIDE
 BUT HE IS NOT A MAN HE IS A MUSHROOM
 A WHAT
 A MUSHROOM
 THE LITTLE PRINCE WAS NOW WHITE WITH RAGE
 THE FLOWERS HAVE BEEN GROWING THORNS FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS
 FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS THE SHEEP HAVE BEEN EATING THEM JUST THE SAME
 AND IS IT NOT A MATTER OF CONSEQUENCE TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE FLOWERS GO TO SO MUCH TROUBLE TO GROW   I  THORNS WHICH ARE NEVER OF ANY USE TO THEM
 IS THE WARFARE BETWEEN THE SHEEP AND THE FLOWERS NOT IMPORTANT
 IS THIS NOT OF MORE CONSEQUENCE THAN A FAT REDFACED GENTLEMANS SUMS
 AND IF I KNOW I MYSELF ONE FLOWER WHICH IS UNIQUE IN THE WORLD WHICH GROWS NOWHERE BUT ON MY PLANET BUT WHICH ONE LITTLE SHEEP CAN DESTROY IN A SINGLE BITE SOME MORNING WITHOUT EVEN NOTICING WHAT HE IS DOING OH
 YOU THINK THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT
 HIS FACE TURNED FROM WHITE TO RED AS HE CONTINUED IF SOME ONE LOVES A FLOWER OF WHICH JUST ONE SINGLE BLOSSOM GROWS IN ALL THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF STARS IT IS ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM HAPPY JUST TO LOOK AT THE STARS
 HE CAN SAY TO HIMSELF SOMEWHERE MY FLOWER IS THERE


 BUT IF THE SHEEP EATS THE FLOWER IN ONE MOMENT ALL HIS STARS WILL BE DARKENED


 AND YOU THINK THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT
 HE COULD NOT SAY ANYTHING MORE
 HIS WORDS WERE CHOKED BY SOBBING
 THE NIGHT HAD FALLEN
 I HAD LET MY TOOLS DROP FROM MY HANDS
 OF WHAT MOMENT NOW WAS MY HAMMER MY BOLT OR THIRST OR DEATH
 ON ONE STAR ONE PLANET MY PLANET THE EARTH THERE WAS A LITTLE PRINCE TO BE COMFORTED
 I TOOK HIM IN MY ARMS AND ROCKED HIM
 I SAID TO HIM THE FLOWER THAT YOU LOVE IS NOT IN DANGER
 I WILL DRAW YOU A MUZZLE FOR YOUR SHEEP
 I WILL DRAW YOU A RAILING TO PUT AROUND YOUR FLOWER
 I WILL


 I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HIM
 I FELT AWKWARD AND BLUNDERING
 I DID NOT KNOW HOW I COULD REACH HIM WHERE I COULD OVERTAKE HIM AND GO ON HAND IN HAND WITH HIM ONCE MORE
 IT IS SUCH A SECRET PLACE THE LAND OF TEARS
 I SOON LEARNED TO KNOW THIS FLOWER BETTER
 ON THE LITTLE PRINCES PLANET THE FLOWERS HAD ALWAYS BEEN VERY SIMPLE
 THEY HAD ONLY ONE RING OF PETALS THEY TOOK UP NO ROOM AT ALL THEY WERE A TROUBLE TO NOBODY
 ONE MORNING THEY WOULD APPEAR IN THE GRASS AND BY NIGHT THEY WOULD HAVE FADED PEACEFULLY AWAY
 BUT ONE DAY FROM A SEED BLOWN FROM NO ONE KNEW WHERE A NEW FLOWER HAD COME UP AND THE LITTLE PRINCE HAD WATCHED VERY CLOSELY OVER THIS SMALL SPROUT WHICH WAS NOT LIKE ANY OTHER SMALL SPROUTS ON HIS PLANET
 IT MIGHT YOU SEE HAVE BEEN A NEW KIND OF BAOBAB
 THE SHRUB SOON STOPPED GROWING AND BEGAN TO GET READY TO PRODUCE A FLOWER
 THE LITTLE PRINCE WHO WAS PRESENT AT THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF A HUGE BUD FELT AT ONCE THAT SOME SORT OF MIRACULOUS APPARITION MUST EMERGE FROM IT
 BUT THE FLOWER WAS NOT SATISFIED TO COMPLETE THE PREPARATIONS FOR HER BEAUTY IN THE SHELTER OF HER GREEN CHAMBER
 SHE CHOSE HER COLOURS WITH THE GREATEST CARE
 SHE ADJUSTED HER PETALS ONE BY ONE
 SHE DID NOT WISH TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD ALL RUMPLED LIKE THE FIELD POPPIES
 IT WAS ONLY IN THE FULL RADIANCE OF HER BEAUTY THAT SHE WISHED TO APPEAR
 OH YES
 SHE WAS A COQUETTISH CREATURE
 AND HER MYSTERIOUS ADORNMENT LASTED FOR DAYS AND DAYS
 THEN ONE MORNING EXACTLY AT SUNRISE SHE SUDDENLY SHOWED HERSELF
 AND AFTER WORKING WITH ALL THIS PAINSTAKING PRECISION SHE YAWNED AND SAID AH
 I AM SCARCELY AWAKE
 I BEG THAT YOU WILL EXCUSE ME
 MY PETALS ARE STILL ALL DISARRANGED


 BUT THE LITTLE PRINCE COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIS ADMIRATION OH
 HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE
 AM I NOT
 THE FLOWER RESPONDED SWEETLY
 AND I WAS BORN AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE SUN


 THE LITTLE PRINCE COULD GUESS EASILY ENOUGH THAT SHE WAS NOT ANY TOO MODEST BUT HOW MOVING AND EXCITING SHE WAS
 I THINK IT IS TIME FOR BREAKFAST SHE ADDED AN INSTANT LATER
 IF YOU WOULD HAVE THE KINDNESS TO THINK OF MY NEEDS AND THE LITTLE PRINCE COMPLETELY ABASHED WENT TO LOOK FOR A SPRINKLING CAN OF FRESH WATER
 SO HE TENDED THE FLOWER
 SO TOO SHE BEGAN VERY QUICKLY TO TORMENT HIM WITH HER VANITY WHICH WAS IF THE TRUTH BE KNOWN A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH
 ONE DAY FOR INSTANCE WHEN SHE WAS SPEAKING OF HER FOUR THORNS SHE SAID TO THE LITTLE PRINCE LET THE TIGERS COME WITH THEIR CLAWS
 THERE ARE NO TIGERS ON MY PLANET THE LITTLE PRINCE OBJECTED
 AND ANYWAY TIGERS DO NOT EAT WEEDS
 I AM NOT A WEED THE FLOWER REPLIED SWEETLY
 PLEASE EXCUSE ME


 I AM NOT AT ALL AFRAID OF TIGERS SHE WENT ON BUT I HAVE A HORROR OF DRAFTS
 I SUPPOSE YOU WOULDNT SCREEN FOR ME
 A HORROR OF DRAFTS THAT IS BAD LUCK FOR A PLANT REMARKED THE LITTLE PRINCE AND ADDED TO HIMSELF THIS FLOWER IS A VERY COMPLEX CREATURE


 AT NIGHT I WANT YOU TO PUT ME UNDER A GLASS GLOBE
 IT IS VERY COLD WHERE YOU LIVE
 IN THE PLACE I CAME FROM


 BUT SHE INTERRUPTED HERSELF AT THAT POINT
 SHE HAD COME IN THE FORM OF A SEED
 SHE COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN ANYTHING OF ANY OTHER WORLDS
 EMBARRASSED OVER HAVING LET HERSELF BE CAUGHT ON THE VERGE OF SUCH AN UNTRUTH SHE COUGHED TWO OR THREE TIMES IN ORDER TO PUT THE LITTLE PRINCE IN THE WRONG
 THE SCREEN
 I WAS JUST GOING TO LOOK FOR IT WHEN YOU SPOKE TO ME


 THEN SHE FORCED HER COUGH A LITTLE MORE SO THAT HE SHOULD SUFFER FROM REMORSE JUST THE SAME
 SO THE LITTLE PRINCE IN SPITE OF ALL THE GOOD WILL THAT WAS INSEPARABLE FROM HIS LOVE HAD SOON COME TO DOUBT HER
 HE HAD TAKEN SERIOUSLY WORDS WHICH WERE WITHOUT IMPORTANCE AND IT MADE HIM VERY UNHAPPY
 I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE LISTENED TO HER HE CONFIDED TO ME ONE DAY
 ONE NEVER OUGHT TO LISTEN TO THE FLOWERS
 ONE SHOULD SIMPLY LOOK AT THEM AND BREATHE THEIR FRAGRANCE
 MINE PERFUMED ALL MY PLANET
 BUT I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO TAKE PLEASURE IN ALL HER GRACE
 THIS TALE OF CLAWS WHICH DISTURBED ME SO MUCH SHOULD ONLY HAVE FILLED MY HEART WITH TENDERNESS AND PITY
 AND HE CONTINUED HIS CONFIDENCES THE FACT IS THAT I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING
 I OUGHT TO HAVE JUDGED BY DEEDS AND NOT BY WORDS
 SHE CAST HER FRAGRANCE AND HER RADIANCE OVER ME
 I OUGHT NEVER TO HAVE RUN AWAY FROM HER


 I OUGHT TO HAVE GUESSED ALL THE AFFECTION THAT LAY BEHIND HER POOR LITTLE STRATAGEMS
 FLOWERS ARE SO INCONSISTENT
 BUT I WAS TOO YOUNG TO KNOW HOW TO LOVE HER


 I BELIEVE THAT FOR HIS ESCAPE HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE MIGRATION OF A FLOCK OF WILD BIRDS
 ON THE MORNING OF HIS DEPARTURE HE PUT HIS PLANET IN PERFECT ORDER
 HE CAREFULLY CLEANED OUT HIS ACTIVE VOLCANOES
 HE POSSESSED TWO ACTIVE VOLCANOES AND THEY WERE VERY CONVENIENT FOR HEATING HIS BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING
 HE ALSO HAD ONE VOLCANO THAT WAS EXTINCT
 BUT AS HE SAID ONE NEVER KNOWS
 SO HE CLEANED OUT THE EXTINCT VOLCANO TOO
 IF THEY ARE WELL CLEANED OUT VOLCANOES BURN SLOWLY AND STEADILY WITHOUT ANY ERUPTIONS
 VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS ARE LIKE FIRES IN A CHIMNEY
 ON OUR EARTH WE ARE OBVIOUSLY MUCH TOO SMALL TO CLEAN OUT OUR VOLCANOES
 THAT IS WHY THEY BRING NO END OF TROUBLE UPON US
 THE LITTLE PRINCE ALSO PULLED UP WITH A CERTAIN SENSE OF DEJECTION THE LAST LITTLE SHOOTS OF THE BAOBABS
 HE BELIEVED THAT HE WOULD NEVER WANT TO RETURN
 BUT ON THIS LAST MORNING ALL THESE FAMILIAR TASKS SEEMED VERY PRECIOUS TO HIM
 AND WHEN HE WATERED THE FLOWER FOR THE LAST TIME AND PREPARED TO PLACE HER UNDER THE SHELTER OF HER GLASS GLOBE HE REALISED THAT HE WAS VERY CLOSE TO TEARS
 GOODBYE HE SAID TO THE FLOWER
 BUT SHE MADE NO ANSWER
 GOODBYE HE SAID AGAIN
 THE FLOWER COUGHED
 BUT IT WAS NOT BECAUSE SHE HAD A COLD
 I HAVE BEEN SILLY SHE SAID TO HIM AT LAST
 I ASK YOUR FORGIVENESS
 TRY TO BE HAPPY


 HE WAS SURPRISED BY THIS ABSENCE OF REPROACHES
 HE STOOD THERE ALL BEWILDERED THE GLASS GLOBE HELD ARRESTED IN MIDAIR
 HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THIS QUIET SWEETNESS
 OF COURSE I LOVE YOU THE FLOWER SAID TO HIM
 IT IS MY FAULT THAT YOU HAVE NOT KNOWN IT ALL THE WHILE
 THAT IS OF NO IMPORTANCE
 BUT YOU YOU HAVE BEEN JUST AS FOOLISH AS I
 TRY TO BE HAPPY


 LET THE GLASS GLOBE BE
 I DONT WANT IT ANY MORE
 BUT THE WIND


 MY COLD IS NOT SO BAD AS ALL THAT


 THE COOL NIGHT AIR WILL DO ME GOOD
 I AM A FLOWER
 BUT THE ANIMALS


 WELL I MUST ENDURE THE PRESENCE OF TWO OR THREE CATERPILLARS IF I WISH TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THE BUTTERFLIES
 IT SEEMS THAT THEY ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL
 AND IF NOT THE BUTTERFLIES AND THE CATERPILLARS WHO WILL CALL UPON ME
 YOU WILL BE FAR AWAY


 AS FOR THE LARGE ANIMALS I AM NOT AT ALL AFRAID OF ANY OF THEM
 I HAVE MY CLAWS
 AND NAIVELY SHE SHOWED HER FOUR THORNS
 THEN SHE ADDED DONT LINGER LIKE THIS
 YOU HAVE DECIDED TO GO AWAY
 NOW GO
 FOR SHE DID NOT WANT HIM TO SEE HER CRYING
 SHE WAS SUCH A PROUD FLOWER


 HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE ASTEROIDS      AND 
 HE BEGAN THEREFORE BY VISITING THEM IN ORDER TO ADD TO HIS KNOWLEDGE
 THE FIRST OF THEM WAS INHABITED BY A KING
 CLAD IN ROYAL PURPLE AND ERMINE HE WAS SEATED UPON A THRONE WHICH WAS AT THE SAME TIME BOTH SIMPLE AND MAJESTIC
 AH
 HERE IS A SUBJECT EXCLAIMED THE KING WHEN HE SAW THE LITTLE PRINCE COMING
 AND THE LITTLE PRINCE ASKED HIMSELF HOW COULD HE RECOGNISE ME WHEN HE HAD NEVER SEEN ME BEFORE
 HE DID NOT KNOW HOW THE WORLD IS SIMPLIFIED FOR KINGS
 TO THEM ALL MEN ARE SUBJECTS
 APPROACH SO THAT I MAY SEE YOU BETTER SAID THE KING WHO FELT CONSUMINGLY PROUD OF BEING AT LAST A KING OVER SOMEBODY
 THE LITTLE PRINCE LOOKED EVERYWHERE TO FIND A PLACE TO SIT DOWN BUT THE ENTIRE PLANET WAS CRAMMED AND OBSTRUCTED BY THE KINGS MAGNIFICENT ERMINE ROBE
 SO HE REMAINED STANDING UPRIGHT AND SINCE HE WAS TIRED HE YAWNED
 IT IS CONTRARY TO ETIQUETTE TO YAWN IN THE PRESENCE OF A KING THE MONARCH SAID TO HIM
 I FORBID YOU TO DO SO
 I CANT HELP IT
 I CANT STOP MYSELF REPLIED THE LITTLE PRINCE THOROUGHLY EMBARRASSED
 I HAVE COME ON A LONG JOURNEY AND I HAVE HAD NO SLEEP


 AH THEN THE KING SAID
 I ORDER YOU TO YAWN
 IT IS YEARS SINCE I HAVE SEEN ANYONE YAWNING
 YAWNS TO ME ARE OBJECTS OF CURIOSITY
 COME NOW
 YAWN AGAIN
 IT IS AN ORDER
 THAT FRIGHTENS ME


 I CANNOT ANY MORE


 MURMURED THE LITTLE PRINCE NOW COMPLETELY ABASHED
 HUM
 HUM
 REPLIED THE KING
 THEN I


 I ORDER YOU SOMETIMES TO YAWN AND SOMETIMES TO HE SPUTTERED A LITTLE AND SEEMED VEXED
 FOR WHAT THE KING FUNDAMENTALLY INSISTED UPON WAS THAT HIS AUTHORITY SHOULD BE RESPECTED
 HE TOLERATED NO DISOBEDIENCE
 HE WAS AN ABSOLUTE MONARCH
 BUT BECAUSE HE WAS A VERY GOOD MAN HE MADE HIS ORDERS REASONABLE
 IF I ORDERED A GENERAL HE WOULD SAY BY WAY OF EXAMPLE IF I ORDERED A GENERAL TO CHANGE HIMSELF INTO A SEA BIRD AND IF THE GENERAL DID NOT OBEY ME THAT WOULD NOT BE THE FAULT OF THE GENERAL
 IT WOULD BE MY FAULT
 MAY I SIT DOWN
 CAME NOW A TIMID INQUIRY FROM THE LITTLE PRINCE
 I ORDER YOU TO DO SO THE KING ANSWERED HIM AND MAJESTICALLY GATHERED IN A FOLD OF HIS ERMINE MANTLE
 BUT THE LITTLE PRINCE WAS WONDERING


 THE PLANET WAS TINY
 OVER WHAT COULD THIS KING REALLY RULE
 SIRE HE SAID TO HIM I BEG THAT YOU WILL EXCUSE MY ASKING YOU A QUESTION I ORDER YOU TO ASK ME A QUESTION THE KING HASTENED TO ASSURE HIM
 SIRE OVER WHAT DO YOU RULE
 OVER EVERYTHING SAID THE KING WITH MAGNIFICENT SIMPLICITY
 OVER EVERYTHING
 THE KING MADE A GESTURE WHICH TOOK IN HIS PLANET THE OTHER PLANETS AND ALL THE STARS
 OVER ALL THAT
 ASKED THE LITTLE PRINCE
 OVER ALL THAT THE KING ANSWERED
 FOR HIS RULE WAS NOT ONLY ABSOLUTE IT WAS ALSO UNIVERSAL
 AND THE STARS OBEY YOU
 CERTAINLY THEY DO THE KING SAID
 THEY OBEY INSTANTLY
 I DO NOT PERMIT INSUBORDINATION
 SUCH POWER WAS A THING FOR THE LITTLE PRINCE TO MARVEL AT
 IF HE HAD BEEN MASTER OF SUCH COMPLETE AUTHORITY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WATCH THE SUNSET NOT FORTYFOUR TIMES IN ONE DAY BUT SEVENTYTWO OR EVEN A HUNDRED OR EVEN TWO HUNDRED TIMES WITH OUT EVER HAVING TO MOVE HIS CHAIR
 AND BECAUSE HE FELT A BIT SAD AS HE REMEMBERED HIS LITTLE PLANET WHICH HE HAD FORSAKEN HE PLUCKED UP HIS COURAGE TO ASK THE KING A FAVOUR I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE A SUNSET


 DO ME THAT KINDNESS


 ORDER THE SUN TO SET


 IF I ORDERED A GENERAL TO FLY FROM ONE FLOWER TO ANOTHER LIKE A BUTTERFLY OR TO WRITE A TRAGIC DRAMA OR TO CHANGE HIMSELF INTO A SEA BIRD AND IF THE GENERAL DID NOT CARRY OUT THE ORDER THAT HE HAD RECEIVED WHICH ONE OF US WOULD BE IN THE WRONG
 THE KING DEMANDED
 THE GENERAL OR MYSELF
 YOU SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE FIRMLY
 EXACTLY
 ONE MUCH REQUIRE FROM EACH ONE THE DUTY WHICH EACH ONE CAN PERFORM THE KING WENT ON
 ACCEPTED AUTHORITY RESTS FIRST OF ALL ON REASON
 IF YOU ORDERED YOUR PEOPLE TO GO AND THROW THEMSELVES INTO THE SEA THEY WOULD RISE UP IN REVOLUTION
 I HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE OBEDIENCE BECAUSE MY ORDERS ARE REASONABLE
 THEN MY SUNSET
 THE LITTLE PRINCE REMINDED HIM FOR HE NEVER FORGOT A QUESTION ONCE HE HAD ASKED IT
 YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR SUNSET
 I SHALL COMMAND IT
 BUT ACCORDING TO MY SCIENCE OF GOVERNMENT I SHALL WAIT UNTIL CONDITIONS ARE FAVOURABLE
 WHEN WILL THAT BE
 INQUIRED THE LITTLE PRINCE
 HUM
 HUM
 REPLIED THE KING AND BEFORE SAYING ANYTHING ELSE HE CONSULTED A BULKY ALMANAC
 HUM
 HUM
 THAT WILL BE ABOUT


 ABOUT


 THAT WILL BE THIS EVENING ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES TO EIGHT
 AND YOU WILL SEE HOW WELL I AM OBEYED
 THE LITTLE PRINCE YAWNED
 HE WAS REGRETTING HIS LOST SUNSET
 AND THEN TOO HE WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO BE A LITTLE BORED
 I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO HERE HE SAID TO THE KING
 SO I SHALL SET OUT ON MY WAY AGAIN
 DO NOT GO SAID THE KING WHO WAS VERY PROUD OF HAVING A SUBJECT
 DO NOT GO
 I WILL MAKE YOU A MINISTER
 MINISTER OF WHAT
 MINSTER OF


OF JUSTICE
 BUT THERE IS NOBODY HERE TO JUDGE
 WE DO NOT KNOW THAT THE KING SAID TO HIM
 I HAVE NOT YET MADE A COMPLETE TOUR OF MY KINGDOM
 I AM VERY OLD
 THERE IS NO ROOM HERE FOR A CARRIAGE
 AND IT TIRES ME TO WALK
 OH BUT I HAVE LOOKED ALREADY
 SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE TURNING AROUND TO GIVE ONE MORE GLANCE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET
 ON THAT SIDE AS ON THIS THERE WAS NOBODY AT ALL


 THEN YOU SHALL JUDGE YOURSELF THE KING ANSWERED THAT IS THE MOST DIFFICULT THING OF ALL
 IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO J UDGE ONESELF THAN TO J UDGE OTHERS
 IF YOU SUCCEED IN J UDGING YOURSELF RIGHTLY THEN YOU ARE INDEED A MAN OF TRUE WISDOM
 YES SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE BUT I CAN JUDGE MYSELF ANYWHERE
 I DO NOT NEED TO LIVE ON THIS PLANET
 HUM
 HUM
 SAID THE KING
 I HAVE GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SOMEWHERE ON MY PLANET THERE IS AN OLD RAT
 I HEAR HIM AT NIGHT
 YOU CAN JUDGE THIS OLD RAT
 FROM TIME TO TIME YOU WILL CONDEMN HIM TO DEATH
 THUS HIS LIFE WILL DEPEND ON YOUR J USTICE
 BUT YOU WILL PARDON HIM ON EACH OCCASION FOR HE MUST BE TREATED THRIFTILY
 HE IS THE ONLY ONE WE HAVE
 I REPLIED THE LITTLE PRINCE DO NOT LIKE TO CONDEMN ANYONE TO DEATH
 AND NOW I THINK I WILL GO ON MY WAY
 NO SAID THE KING
 BUT THE LITTLE PRINCE HAVING NOW COMPLETED HIS PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE HAD NO WISH TO GRIEVE THE OLD MONARCH
 IF YOUR MAJESTY WISHES TO BE PROMPTLY OBEYED HE SAID HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE ME A REASONABLE ORDER
 HE SHOULD BE ABLE FOR EXAMPLE TO ORDER ME TO BE GONE BY THE END OF ONE MINUTE
 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT CONDITIONS ARE FAVOURABLE


 AS THE KING MADE NO ANSWER THE LITTLE PRINCE HESITATED A MOMENT
 THEN WITH A SIGH HE TOOK HIS LEAVE
 I MADE YOU MY AMBASSADOR THE KING CALLED OUT HASTILY
 HE HAD A MAGNIFICENT AIR OF AUTHORITY
 THE GROWNUPS ARE VERY STRANGE THE LITTLE PRINCE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE CONTINUED ON HIS JOURNEY
 THE SECOND PLANET WAS INHABITED BY A CONCEITED MAN
 AH
 AH
 I AM ABOUT TO RECEIVE A VISIT FROM AN ADMIRER
 HE EXCLAIMED FROM AFAR WHEN HE FIRST SAW THE LITTLE PRINCE COMING
 FOR TO CONCEITED MEN ALL OTHER MEN ARE ADMIRERS
 GOOD MORNING SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 THAT IS A QUEER HAT YOU ARE WEARING
 IT IS A HAT FOR SALUTES THE CONCEITED MAN REPLIED
 IT IS TO RAISE IN SALUTE WHEN PEOPLE ACCLAIM ME
 UNFORTUNATELY NOBODY AT ALL EVER PASSES THIS WAY
 YES
 SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CONCEITED MAN WAS TALKING ABOUT
 CLAP YOUR HANDS ONE AGAINST THE OTHER THE CONCEITED MAN NOW DIRECTED HIM
 THE LITTLE PRINCE CLAPPED HIS HANDS
 THE CONCEITED MAN RAISED HIS HAT IN A MODEST SALUTE
 THIS IS MORE ENTERTAINING THAN THE VISIT TO THE KING THE LITTLE PRINCE SAID TO HIMSELF
 AND HE BEGAN AGAIN TO CLAP HIS HANDS ONE AGAINST THE OTHER
 THE CONCEITED MAN AGAINST RAISED HIS HAT IN SALUTE
 AFTER FIVE MINUTES OF THIS EXERCISE THE LITTLE PRINCE GREW TIRED OF THE GAMES MONOTONY
 AND WHAT SHOULD ONE DO TO MAKE THE HAT COME DOWN
 HE ASKED
 BUT THE CONCEITED MAN DID NOT HEAR HIM
 CONCEITED PEOPLE NEVER HEAR ANYTHING BUT PRAISE
 DO YOU REALLY ADMIRE ME VERY MUCH
 HE DEMANDED OF THE LITTLE PRINCE
 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ADMIRE
 TO ADMIRE MEANS THAT YOU REGARD ME AS THE HANDSOMEST THE BESTDRESSED THE RICHEST AND THE MOST INTELLIGENT MAN ON THIS PLANET
 BUT YOU ARE THE ONLY MAN ON YOUR PLANET
 DO ME THIS KINDNESS
 ADMIRE ME JUST THE SAME
 I ADMIRE YOU SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS SLIGHTLY BUT WHAT IS THERE IN THAT TO INTEREST YOU SO MUCH
 AND THE LITTLE PRINCE WENT AWAY
 THE GROWNUPS ARE CERTAINLY VERY ODD HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE CONTINUED ON HIS JOURNEY
 THE NEXT PLANET WAS INHABITED BY A TIPPLER
 THIS WAS A VERY SHORT VISIT BUT IT PLUNGED THE LITTLE PRINCE INTO DEEP DEJECTION
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE
 HE SAID TO THE TIPPLER WHOM HE FOUND SETTLED DOWN IN SILENCE BEFORE A COLLECTION OF EMPTY BOTTLES AND ALSO A COLLECTION OF FULL BOTTLES
 I AM DRINKING REPLIED THE TIPPLER WITH A LUGUBRIOUS AIR
 WHY ARE YOU DRINKING
 DEMANDED THE LITTLE PRINCE
 SO THAT I MAY FORGET REPLIED THE TIPPLER
 FORGET WHAT
 INQUIRED THE LITTLE PRINCE WHO ALREADY WAS SORRY FOR HIM
 FORGET THAT I AM ASHAMED THE TIPPLER CONFESSED HANGING HIS HEAD
 ASHAMED OF WHAT
 INSISTED THE LITTLE PRINCE WHO WANTED TO HELP HIM
 ASHAMED OF DRINKING
 THE TIPPLER BROUGHT HIS SPEECH TO AN END AND SHUT HIMSELF UP IN AN IMPREGNABLE SILENCE
 AND THE LITTLE PRINCE WENT AWAY PUZZLED
 THE GROWNUPS ARE CERTAINLY VERY VERY ODD HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE CONTINUED ON HIS JOURNEY
 THE FOURTH PLANET BELONGED TO A BUSINESSMAN
 THIS MAN WAS SO MUCH OCCUPIED THAT HE DID NOT EVEN RAISE HIS HEAD AT THE LITTLE PRINCES ARRIVAL
 GOOD MORNING THE LITTLE PRINCE SAID TO HIM
 YOUR CIGARETTE HAS GONE OUT
 THREE AND TWO MAKE FIVE
 FIVE AND SEVEN MAKE TWELVE
 TWELVE AND THREE MAKE FIFTEEN
 GOOD MORNING
 FIFTEEN AND SEVEN MAKE TWENTYTWO
 TWENTYTWO AND SIX MAKE TWENTYEIGHT
 I HAVENT TIME TO LIGHT IT AGAIN
 TWENTYSIX AND FIVE MAKE THIRTYONE
 PHEW 
 THEN THAT MAKES FIVEHUNDRED ANDONEMILLION SIXHUNDREDTWENTYTWOTHOUSAND SEVENHUNDREDTHIRTYONE
 FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WHAT
 ASKED THE LITTLE PRINCE
 EH
 ARE YOU STILL THERE
 FIVEHUNDREDAND ONE MILLION I CANT STOP


 I HAVE SO MUCH TO DO
 I AM CONCERNED WITH MATTERS OF CONSEQUENCE
 I DONT AMUSE MYSELF WITH BALDERDASH
 TWO AND FIVE MAKE SEVEN


 FIVEHUNDREDANDONE MILLION WHAT
 REPEATED THE LITTLE PRINCE WHO NEVER IN HIS LIFE HAD LET GO OF A QUESTION ONCE HE HAD ASKED IT
 THE BUSINESSMAN RAISED HIS HEAD
 DURING THE FIFTYFOUR YEARS THAT I HAVE INHABITED THIS PLANET I HAVE BEEN DISTURBED ONLY THREE TIMES
 THE FIRST TIME WAS TWENTYTWO YEARS AGO WHEN SOME GIDDY GOOSE FELL FROM GOODNESS KNOWS WHERE
 HE MADE THE MOST FRIGHTFUL NOISE THAT RESOUNDED ALL OVER THE PLACE AND I MADE FOUR MISTAKES IN MY ADDITION
 THE SECOND TIME ELEVEN YEARS AGO I WAS DISTURBED BY AN ATTACK OF RHEUMATISM
 I DONT GET ENOUGH EXERCISE
 I HAVE NO TIME FOR LOAFING
 THE THIRD TIME WELL THIS IS IT
 I WAS SAYING THEN FIVE HUNDREDANDONE MILLIONS MILLIONS OF WHAT
 THE BUSINESSMAN SUDDENLY REALISED THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE OF BEING LEFT IN PEACE UNTIL HE ANSWERED THIS QUESTION
 MILLIONS OF THOSE LITTLE OBJECTS HE SAID WHICH ONE SOMETIMES SEES IN THE SKY
 FLIES
 OH NO
 LITTLE GLITTERING OBJECTS
 BEES
 OH NO
 LITTLE GOLDEN OBJECTS THAT SET LAZY MEN TO IDLE DREAMING
 AS FOR ME I AM CONCERNED WITH MATTERS OF CONSEQUENCE
 THERE IS NO TIME FOR IDLE DREAMING IN MY LIFE
 AH
 YOU MEAN THE STARS
 YES THATS IT
 THE STARS
 AND WHAT DO YOU DO WITH FIVEHUNDRED MILLIONS OF STARS
 FIVEHUNDREDANDONE MILLION SIXHUNDREDTWENTYTWO THOUSAND SEVENHUNDREDTHIRTYONE
 I AM CONCERNED WITH MATTERS OF CONSEQUENCE I AM ACCURATE
 AND WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THESE STARS
 WHAT DO I DO WITH THEM
 YES
 NOTHING
 I OWN THEM
 YOU OWN THE STARS
 YES
 BUT I HAVE ALREADY SEEN A KING WHO


 KINGS DO NOT OWN THEY REIGN OVER
 IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT MATTER
 AND WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO YOU TO OWN THE STARS
 IT DOES ME THE GOOD OF MAKING ME RICH
 AND WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO YOU TO BE RICH
 IT MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO BUY MORE STARS IF ANY ARE EVER DISCOVERED
 THIS MAN THE LITTLE PRINCE SAID TO HIMSELF REASONS A LITTLE LIKE MY POOR TIPPLER


 NEVERTHELESS HE STILL HAD SOME MORE QUESTIONS
 HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR ONE TO OWN THE STARS
 TO WHOM DO THEY BELONG
 THE BUSINESSMAN RETORTED PEEVISHLY
 I DONT KNOW
 TO NOBODY
 THEN THEY BELONG TO ME BECAUSE I WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO THINK OF IT
 IS THAT ALL THAT IS NECESSARY
 CERTAINLY
 WHEN YOU FIND A DIAMOND THAT BELONGS TO NOBODY IT IS YOURS
 WHEN YOU DISCOVER AN ISLAND THAT BELONGS TO NOBODY IT IS YOURS
 WHEN YOU GET AN IDEA BEFORE ANY ONE ELSE YOU TAKE OUT A PATENT ON IT IT IS YOURS
 SO WITH ME I OWN THE STARS BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE BEFORE ME EVER THOUGHT OF OWNING THEM
 YES THAT IS TRUE SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 AND WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THEM
 I ADMINISTER THEM REPLIED THE BUSINESSMAN
 I COUNT THEM AND RECOUNT THEM
 IT IS DIFFICULT
 BUT I AM A MAN WHO IS NATURALLY INTERESTED IN MATTERS OF CONSEQUENCE
 THE LITTLE PRINCE WAS STILL NOT SATISFIED
 IF I OWNED A SILK SCARF HE SAID I COULD PUT IT AROUND MY NECK AND TAKE IT AWAY WITH ME
 IF I OWNED A FLOWER I COULD PLUCK THAT FLOWER AND TAKE IT AWAY WITH ME
 BUT YOU CANNOT PLUCK THE STARS FROM HEAVEN


 NO
 BUT I CAN PUT THEM IN THE BANK
 WHATEVER DOES THAT MEAN
 THAT MEANS THAT I WRITE THE NUMBER OF MY STARS ON A LITTLE PAPER
 AND THEN I PUT THIS PAPER IN A DRAWER AND LOCK IT WITH A KEY
 AND THAT IS ALL
 THAT IS ENOUGH SAID THE BUSINESSMAN
 IT IS ENTERTAINING THOUGHT THE LITTLE PRINCE
 IT IS RATHER POETIC
 BUT IT IS OF NO GREAT CONSEQUENCE
 ON MATTERS OF CONSEQUENCE THE LITTLE PRINCE HAD IDEAS WHICH WERE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE GROWNUPS
 I MYSELF OWN A FLOWER HE CONTINUED HIS CONVERSATION WITH THE BUSINESSMAN WHICH I WATER EVERY DAY
 I OWN THREE VOLCANOES WHICH I CLEAN OUT EVERY WEEK FOR I ALSO CLEAN OUT THE ONE THAT IS EXTINCT ONE NEVER KNOWS
 IT IS OF SOME USE TO MY VOLCANOES AND IT IS OF SOME USE TO MY FLOWER THAT I OWN THEM
 BUT YOU ARE OF NO USE TO THE STARS


 THE BUSINESSMAN OPENED HIS MOUTH BUT HE FOUND NOTHING TO SAY IN ANSWER
 AND THE LITTLE PRINCE WENT AWAY
 THE GROWNUPS ARE CERTAINLY ALTOGETHER EXTRAORDINARY HE SAID SIMPLY TALKING TO HIMSELF AS HE CONTINUED ON HIS JOURNEY
 THE FIFTH PLANET WAS VERY STRANGE
 IT WAS THE SMALLEST OF ALL
 THERE WAS JUST ENOUGH ROOM ON IT FOR A STREET LAMP AND A LAMPLIGHTER
 THE LITTLE PRINCE WAS NOT ABLE TO REACH ANY EXPLANATION OF THE USE OF A STREET LAMP AND A LAMPLIGHTER SOMEWHERE IN THE HEAVENS ON A PLANET WHICH HAD NO PEOPLE AND NOT ONE HOUSE
 BUT HE SAID TO HIMSELF NEVERTHELESS IT MAY WELL BE THAT THIS MAN IS ABSURD
 BUT HE IS NOT SO ABSURD AS THE KING THE CONCEITED MAN THE BUSINESSMAN AND THE TIPPLER
 FOR AT LEAST HIS WORK HAS SOME MEANING
 WHEN HE LIGHTS HIS STREET LAMP IT IS AS IF HE BROUGHT ONE MORE STAR TO LIFE OR ONE FLOWER
 WHEN HE PUTS OUT HIS LAMP HE SENDS THE FLOWER OR THE STAR TO SLEEP
 THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL OCCUPATION
 AND SINCE IT IS BEAUTIFUL IT IS TRULY USEFUL
 WHEN HE ARRIVED ON THE PLANET HE RESPECTFULLY SALUTED THE LAMPLIGHTER
 GOOD MORNING
 WHY HAVE YOU JUST PUT OUT YOUR LAMP
 THOSE ARE THE ORDERS REPLIED THE LAMPLIGHTER
 GOOD MORNING
 WHAT ARE THE ORDERS
 THE ORDERS ARE THAT I PUT OUT MY LAMP
 GOOD EVENING
 AND HE LIGHTED HIS LAMP AGAIN
 BUT WHY HAVE YOU JUST LIGHTED IT AGAIN
 THOSE ARE THE ORDERS REPLIED THE LAMPLIGHTER
 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 THERE IS NOTHING TO UNDERSTAND SAID THE LAMPLIGHTER
 ORDERS ARE ORDERS
 GOOD MORNING
 AND HE PUT OUT HIS LAMP
 THEN HE MOPPED HIS FOREHEAD WITH A HANDKERCHIEF DECORATED WITH RED SQUARES
 I FOLLOW A TERRIBLE PROFESSION
 IN THE OLD DAYS IT WAS REASONABLE
 I PUT THE LAMP OUT IN THE MORNING AND IN THE EVENING I LIGHTED IT AGAIN
 I HAD THE REST OF THE DAY FOR RELAXATION AND THE REST OF THE NIGHT FOR SLEEP
 AND THE ORDERS HAVE BEEN CHANGED SINCE THAT TIME
 THE ORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN CHANGED SAID THE LAMPLIGHTER
 THAT IS THE TRAGEDY
 FROM YEAR TO YEAR THE PLANET HAS TURNED MORE RAPIDLY AND THE ORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN CHANGED
 THEN WHAT
 ASKED THE LITTLE PRINCE
 THEN THE PLANET NOW MAKES A COMPLETE TURN EVERY MINUTE AND I NO LONGER HAVE A SINGLE SECOND FOR REPOSE
 ONCE EVERY MINUTE I HAVE TO LIGHT MY LAMP AND PUT IT OUT
 THAT IS VERY FUNNY
 A DAY LASTS ONLY ONE MINUTE HERE WHERE YOU LIVE
 IT IS NOT FUNNY AT ALL
 SAID THE LAMPLIGHTER
 WHILE WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TOGETHER A MONTH HAS GONE BY
 A MONTH
 YES A MONTH
 THIRTY MINUTES
 THIRTY DAYS
 GOOD EVENING
 AND HE LIGHTED HIS LAMP AGAIN
 AS THE LITTLE PRINCE WATCHED HIM HE FELT THAT HE LOVED THIS LAMPLIGHTER WHO WAS SO FAITHFUL TO HIS ORDERS
 HE REMEMBERED THE SUNSETS WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD GONE TO SEEK IN OTHER DAYS MERELY BY PULLING UP HIS CHAIR AND HE WANTED TO HELP HIS FRIEND
 YOU KNOW HE SAID I CAN TELL YOU A WAY YOU CAN REST WHENEVER YOU WANT TO


 I ALWAYS WANT TO REST SAID THE LAMPLIGHTER
 FOR IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A MAN TO BE FAITHFUL AND LAZY AT THE SAME TIME
 THE LITTLE PRINCE WENT ON WITH HIS EXPLANATION YOUR PLANET IS SO SMALL THAT THREE STRIDES WILL TAKE YOU ALL THE WAY AROUND IT
 TO BE ALWAYS IN THE SUNSHINE YOU NEED ONLY WALK ALONG RATHER SLOWLY
 WHEN YOU WANT TO REST YOU WILL WALK AND THE DAY WILL LAST AS LONG AS YOU LIKE
 THAT DOESNT DO ME MUCH GOOD SAID THE LAMPLIGHTER
 THE ONE THING I LOVE IN LIFE IS TO SLEEP
 THEN YOURE UNLUCKY SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 I AM UNLUCKY SAID THE LAMPLIGHTER
 GOOD MORNING
 AND HE PUT OUT HIS LAMP
 THAT MAN SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE TO HIMSELF AS HE CONTINUED FARTHER ON HIS JOURNEY THAT MAN WOULD BE SCORNED BY ALL THE OTHERS BY THE KING BY THE CONCEITED MAN BY THE TIPPLER BY THE BUSINESSMAN
 NEVERTHELESS HE IS THE ONLY ONE OF THEM ALL WHO DOES NOT SEEM TO ME RIDICULOUS
 PERHAPS THAT IS BECAUSE HE IS THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE BESIDES HIMSELF
 HE BREATHED A SIGH OF REGRET AND SAID TO HIMSELF AGAIN THAT MAN IS THE ONLY ONE OF THEM ALL WHOM I COULD HAVE MADE MY FRIEND
 BUT HIS PLANET IS INDEED TOO SMALL
 THERE IS NO ROOM ON IT FOR TWO PEOPLE


 WHAT THE LITTLE PRINCE DID NOT DARE CONFESS WAS THAT HE WAS SORRY MOST OF ALL TO LEAVE THIS PLANET BECAUSE IT WAS BLEST EVERY DAY WITH  SUNSETS
 THE SIXTH PLANET WAS TEN TIMES LARGER THAN THE LAST ONE
 IT WAS INHABITED BY AN OLD GENTLEMAN WHO WROTE VOLUMINOUS BOOKS
 OH LOOK
 HERE IS AN EXPLORER
 HE EXCLAIMED TO HIMSELF WHEN HE SAW THE LITTLE PRINCE COMING
 THE LITTLE PRINCE SAT DOWN ON THE TABLE AND PANTED A LITTLE
 HE HAD ALREADY TRAVELLED SO MUCH AND SO FAR
 WHERE DO YOU COME FROM
 THE OLD GENTLEMAN SAID TO HIM
 WHAT IS THAT BIG BOOK
 SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING
 I AM A GEOGRAPHER THE OLD GENTLEMAN SAID TO HIM
 WHAT IS A GEOGRAPHER
 ASKED THE LITTLE PRINCE
 A GEOGRAPHER IS A SCHOLAR WHO KNOWS THE LOCATION OF ALL THE SEAS RIVERS TOWNS MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS
 THAT IS VERY INTERESTING SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 HERE AT LAST IS A MAN WHO HAS A REAL PROFESSION
 AND HE CAST A LOOK AROUND HIM AT THE PLANET OF THE GEOGRAPHER
 IT WAS THE MOST MAGNIFICENT AND STATELY PLANET THAT HE HAD EVER SEEN
 YOUR PLANET IS VERY BEAUTIFUL HE SAID
 HAS IT ANY OCEANS
 I COULDNT TELL YOU SAID THE GEOGRAPHER
 AH
 THE LITTLE PRINCE WAS DISAPPOINTED
 HAS IT ANY MOUNTAINS
 I COULDNT TELL YOU SAID THE GEOGRAPHER
 AND TOWNS AND RIVERS AND DESERTS
 I COULDNT TELL YOU THAT EITHER
 BUT YOU ARE A GEOGRAPHER
 EXACTLY THE GEOGRAPHER SAID
 BUT I AM NOT AN EXPLORER
 I HAVENT A SINGLE EXPLORER ON MY PLANET
 IT IS NOT THE GEOGRAPHER WHO GOES OUT TO COUNT THE TOWNS THE RIVERS THE MOUNTAINS THE SEAS THE OCEANS AND THE DESERTS
 THE GEOGRAPHER IS MUCH TOO IMPORTANT TO GO LOAFING ABOUT
 HE DOES NOT LEAVE HIS DESK
 BUT HE RECEIVES THE EXPLORERS IN HIS STUDY
 HE ASKS THEM QUESTIONS AND HE NOTES DOWN WHAT THEY RECALL OF THEIR TRAVELS
 AND IF THE RECOLLECTIONS OF ANY ONE AMONG THEM SEEM INTERESTING TO HIM THE GEOGRAPHER ORDERS AN INQUIRY INTO THAT EXPLORERS MORAL CHARACTER
 WHY IS THAT
 BECAUSE AN EXPLORER WHO TOLD LIES WOULD BRING DISASTER ON THE BOOKS OF THE GEOGRAPHER
 SO WOULD AN EXPLORER WHO DRANK TOO MUCH
 WHY IS THAT
 ASKED THE LITTLE PRINCE
 BECAUSE INTOXICATED MEN SEE DOUBLE
 THEN THE GEOGRAPHER WOULD NOTE DOWN TWO MOUNTAINS IN A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS ONLY ONE
 I KNOW SOME ONE SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE WHO WOULD MAKE A BAD EXPLORER
 THAT IS POSSIBLE
 THEN WHEN THE MORAL CHARACTER OF THE EXPLORER IS SHOWN TO BE GOOD AN INQUIRY IS ORDERED INTO HIS DISCOVERY
 ONE GOES TO SEE IT
 NO
 THAT WOULD BE TOO COMPLICATED
 BUT ONE REQUIRES THE EXPLORER TO FURNISH PROOFS
 FOR EXAMPLE IF THE DISCOVERY IN QUESTION IS THAT OF A LARGE MOUNTAIN ONE REQUIRES THAT LARGE STONES BE BROUGHT BACK FROM IT
 THE GEOGRAPHER WAS SUDDENLY STIRRED TO EXCITEMENT
 BUT YOU COME FROM FAR AWAY
 YOU ARE AN EXPLORER
 YOU SHALL DESCRIBE YOUR PLANET TO ME
 AND HAVING OPENED HIS BIG REGISTER THE GEOGRAPHER SHARPENED HIS PENCIL
 THE RECITALS OF EXPLORERS ARE PUT DOWN FIRST IN PENCIL
 ONE WAITS UNTIL THE EXPLORER HAS FURNISHED PROOFS BEFORE PUTTING THEM DOWN IN INK
 WELL
 SAID THE GEOGRAPHER EXPECTANTLY
 OH WHERE I LIVE SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE IT IS NOT VERY INTERESTING
 IT IS ALL SO SMALL
 I HAVE THREE VOLCANOES
 TWO VOLCANOES ARE ACTIVE AND THE OTHER IS EXTINCT
 BUT ONE NEVER KNOWS
 ONE NEVER KNOWS SAID THE GEOGRAPHER
 I HAVE ALSO A FLOWER
 WE DO NOT RECORD FLOWERS SAID THE GEOGRAPHER
 WHY IS THAT
 THE FLOWER IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING ON MY PLANET
 WE DO NOT RECORD THEM SAID THE GEOGRAPHER BECAUSE THEY ARE EPHEMERAL
 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EPHEMERAL
 GEOGRAPHIES SAID THE GEOGRAPHER ARE THE BOOKS WHICH OF ALL BOOKS ARE MOST CONCERNED WITH MATTERS OF CONSEQUENCE
 THEY NEVER BECOME OLDFASHIONED
 IT IS VERY RARELY THAT A MOUNTAIN CHANGES ITS POSITION
 IT IS VERY RARELY THAT AN OCEAN EMPTIES ITSELF OF ITS WATERS
 WE WRITE OF ETERNAL THINGS
 BUT EXTINCT VOLCANOES MAY COME TO LIFE AGAIN THE LITTLE PRINCE INTERRUPTED
 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EPHEMERAL
 WHETHER VOLCANOES ARE EXTINCT OR ALIVE IT COMES TO THE SAME THING FOR US SAID THE GEOGRAPHER
 THE THING THAT MATTERS TO US IS THE MOUNTAIN
 IT DOES NOT CHANGE
 BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EPHEMERAL
 REPEATED THE LITTLE PRINCE WHO NEVER IN HIS LIFE HAD LET GO OF A QUESTION ONCE HE HAD ASKED IT
 IT MEANS WHICH IS IN DANGER OF SPEEDY DISAPPEARANCE
  IS MY FLOWER IN DANGER OF SPEEDY DISAPPEARANCE
 CERTAINLY IT IS
 MY FLOWER IS EPHEMERAL THE LITTLE PRINCE SAID TO HIMSELF AND SHE HAS ONLY FOUR THORNS TO DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST THE WORLD
 AND I HAVE LEFT HER ON MY PLANET ALL ALONE
 THAT WAS HIS FIRST MOMENT OF REGRET
 BUT HE TOOK COURAGE ONCE MORE
 WHAT PLACE WOULD YOU ADVISE ME TO VISIT NOW
 HE ASKED
 THE PLANET EARTH REPLIED THE GEOGRAPHER
 IT HAS A GOOD REPUTATION
 AND THE LITTLE PRINCE WENT AWAY THINKING OF HIS FLOWER
 SO THEN THE SEVENTH PLANET WAS THE EARTH
 THE EARTH IS NOT JUST AN ORDINARY PLANET
 ONE CAN COUNT THERE  KINGS NOT FORGETTING TO BE SURE THE NEGRO KINGS AMONG THEM  GEOGRAPHERS  BUSINESSMEN  TIPPLERS  CONCEITED MEN THAT IS TO SAY ABOUT  GROWNUPS
 TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE SIZE OF THE EARTH I WILL TELL YOU THAT BEFORE THE INVENTION OF ELECTRICITY IT WAS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN OVER THE WHOLE OF THE SIX CONTINENTS A VERITABLE ARMY OF  LAMPLIGHTERS FOR THE STREET LAMPS
 SEEN FROM A SLIGHT DISTANCE THAT WOULD MAKE A SPLENDID SPECTACLE
 THE MOVEMENTS OF THIS ARMY WOULD BE REGULATED LIKE THOSE OF THE BALLET IN THE OPERA
 FIRST WOULD COME THE TURN OF THE LAMPLIGHTERS OF NEW ZEALAND AND AUSTRALIA
 HAVING SET THEIR LAMPS ALIGHT THESE WOULD GO OFF TO SLEEP
 NEXT THE LAMPLIGHTERS OF CHINA AND SIBERIA WOULD ENTER FOR THEIR STEPS IN THE DANCE AND THEN THEY TOO WOULD BE WAVED BACK INTO THE WINGS
 AFTER THAT WOULD COME THE TURN OF THE LAMPLIGHTERS OF RUSSIA AND THE INDIES THEN THOSE OF AFRICA AND EUROPE THEN THOSE OF SOUTH AMERICA THEN THOSE OF NORTH AMERICA
 AND NEVER WOULD THEY MAKE A MISTAKE IN THE ORDER OF THEIR ENTRY UPON THE STAGE
 IT WOULD BE MAGNIFICENT
 ONLY THE MAN WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE SINGLE LAMP AT THE NORTH POLE AND HIS COLLEAGUE WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SINGLE LAMP AT THE SOUTH POLE ONLY THESE TWO WOULD LIVE FREE FROM TOIL AND CARE THEY WOULD BE BUSY TWICE A YEAR
 WHEN ONE WISHES TO PLAY THE WIT HE SOMETIMES WANDERS A LITTLE FROM THE TRUTH
 I HAVE NOT BEEN ALTOGETHER HONEST IN WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU ABOUT THE LAMPLIGHTERS
 AND I REALISE THAT I RUN THE RISK OF GIVING A FALSE IDEA OF OUR PLANET TO THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW IT
 MEN OCCUPY A VERY SMALL PLACE UPON THE EARTH
 IF THE TWO BILLION INHABITANTS WHO PEOPLE ITS SURFACE WERE ALL TO STAND UPRIGHT AND SOMEWHAT CROWDED TOGETHER AS THEY DO FOR SOME BIG PUBLIC ASSEMBLY THEY COULD EASILY BE PUT INTO ONE PUBLIC SQUARE TWENTY MILES LONG AND TWENTY MILES WIDE
 ALL HUMANITY COULD BE PILED UP ON A SMALL PACIFIC ISLET
 THE GROWNUPS TO BE SURE WILL NOT BELIEVE YOU WHEN YOU TELL THEM THAT
 THEY IMAGINE THAT THEY FILL A GREAT DEAL OF SPACE
 THEY FANCY THEMSELVES AS IMPORTANT AS THE BAOBABS
 YOU SHOULD ADVISE THEM THEN TO MAKE THEIR OWN CALCULATIONS
 THEY ADORE FIGURES AND THAT WILL PLEASE THEM
 BUT DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS EXTRA TASK
 IT IS UNNECESSARY
 YOU HAVE I KNOW CONFIDENCE IN ME
 WHEN THE LITTLE PRINCE ARRIVED ON THE EARTH HE WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED NOT TO SEE ANY PEOPLE
 HE WAS BEGINNING TO BE AFRAID HE HAD COME TO THE WRONG PLANET WHEN A COIL OF GOLD THE COLOUR OF THE MOONLIGHT FLASHED ACROSS THE SAND
 GOOD EVENING SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE COURTEOUSLY
 GOOD EVENING SAID THE SNAKE
 WHAT PLANET IS THIS ON WHICH I HAVE COME DOWN
 ASKED THE LITTLE PRINCE
 THIS IS THE EARTH THIS IS AFRICA THE SNAKE ANSWERED
 AH
 THEN THERE ARE NO PEOPLE ON THE EARTH
 THIS IS THE DESERT
 THERE ARE NO PEOPLE IN THE DESERT
 THE EARTH IS LARGE SAID THE SNAKE
 THE LITTLE PRINCE SAT DOWN ON A STONE AND RAISED HIS EYES TOWARD THE SKY
 I WONDER HE SAID WHETHER THE STARS ARE SET ALIGHT IN HEAVEN SO THAT ONE DAY EACH ONE OF US MAY FIND HIS OWN AGAIN


 LOOK AT MY PLANET
 IT IS RIGHT THERE ABOVE US
 BUT HOW FAR AWAY IT IS
 IT IS BEAUTIFUL THE SNAKE SAID
 WHAT HAS BROUGHT YOU HERE
 I HAVE BEEN HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH A FLOWER SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 AH
 SAID THE SNAKE
 AND THEY WERE BOTH SILENT
 WHERE ARE THE MEN
 THE LITTLE PRINCE AT LAST TOOK UP THE CONVERSATION AGAIN
 IT IS A LITTLE LONELY IN THE DESERT


 IT IS ALSO LONELY AMONG MEN THE SNAKE SAID
 THE LITTLE PRINCE GAZED AT HIM FOR A LONG TIME
 YOU ARE A FUNNY ANIMAL HE SAID AT LAST
 YOU ARE NO THICKER THAN A FINGER


 BUT I AM MORE POWERFUL THAN THE FINGER OF A KING SAID THE SNAKE
 THE LITTLE PRINCE SMILED
 YOU ARE NOT VERY POWERFUL
 YOU HAVENT EVEN ANY FEET
 YOU CANNOT EVEN TRAVEL


 I CAN CARRY YOU FARTHER THAN ANY SHIP COULD TAKE YOU SAID THE SNAKE
 HE TWINED HIMSELF AROUND THE LITTLE PRINCES ANKLE LIKE A GOLDEN BRACELET
 WHOMEVER I TOUCH I SEND BACK TO THE EARTH FROM WHENCE HE CAME THE SNAKE SPOKE AGAIN
 BUT YOU ARE INNOCENT AND TRUE AND YOU COME FROM A STAR


 THE LITTLE PRINCE MADE NO REPLY
 YOU MOVE ME TO PITY YOU ARE SO WEAK ON THIS EARTH MADE OF GRANITE THE SNAKE SAID
 I CAN HELP YOU SOME DAY IF YOU GROW TOO HOMESICK FOR YOUR OWN PLANET
 I CAN


 OH
 I UNDERSTAND YOU VERY WELL SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 BUT WHY DO YOU ALWAYS SPEAK IN RIDDLES
 I SOLVE THEM ALL SAID THE SNAKE
 AND THEY WERE BOTH SILENT
 THE LITTLE PRINCE CROSSED THE DESERT AND MET WITH ONLY ONE FLOWER
 IT WAS A FLOWER WITH THREE PETALS A FLOWER OF NO ACCOUNT AT ALL
 GOOD MORNING SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 GOOD MORNING SAID THE FLOWER
 WHERE ARE THE MEN
 THE LITTLE PRINCE ASKED POLITELY
 THE FLOWER HAD ONCE SEEN A CARAVAN PASSING
 MEN
 SHE ECHOED
 I THINK THERE ARE SIX OR SEVEN OF THEM IN EXISTENCE
 I SAW THEM SEVERAL YEARS AGO
 BUT ONE NEVER KNOWS WHERE TO FIND THEM
 THE WIND BLOWS THEM AWAY
 THEY HAVE NO ROOTS AND THAT MAKES THEIR LIFE VERY DIFFICULT
 GOODBYE SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 GOODBYE SAID THE FLOWER
 AFTER THAT THE LITTLE PRINCE CLIMBED A HIGH MOUNTAIN
 THE ONLY MOUNTAINS HE HAD EVER KNOWN WERE THE THREE VOLCANOES WHICH CAME UP TO HIS KNEES
 AND HE USED THE EXTINCT VOLCANO AS A FOOTSTOOL
 FROM A MOUNTAIN AS HIGH AS THIS ONE HE SAID TO HIMSELF I SHALL BE ABLE TO SEE THE WHOLE PLANET AT ONE GLANCE AND ALL THE PEOPLE


 BUT HE SAW NOTHING SAVE PEAKS OF ROCK THAT WERE SHARPENED LIKE NEEDLES
 GOOD MORNING HE SAID COURTEOUSLY
 GOOD MORNING


GOOD MORNING


GOOD MORNING ANSWERED THE ECHO
 WHO ARE YOU
 SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 WHO ARE YOU


WHO ARE YOU


WHO ARE YOU
 ANSWERED THE ECHO
 BE MY FRIENDS
 I AM ALL ALONE HE SAID
 I AM ALL ALONE


ALL ALONE
 

ALL ALONE ANSWERED THE ECHO
 WHAT A QUEER PLANET
 HE THOUGHT
 IT IS ALTOGETHER DRY AND ALTOGETHER POINTED AND ALTOGETHER HARSH AND FORBIDDING
 AND THE PEOPLE HAVE NO IMAGINATION
 THEY REPEAT WHATEVER ONE SAYS TO THEM


 ON MY PLANET I HAD A FLOWER SHE ALWAYS WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK


 BUT IT HAPPENED THAT AFTER WALKING FOR A LONG TIME THROUGH SAND AND ROCKS AND SNOW THE LITTLE PRINCE AT LAST CAME UPON A ROAD
 AND ALL ROADS LEAD TO THE ABODES OF MEN
 GOOD MORNING HE SAID
 HE WAS STANDING BEFORE A GARDEN ALL ABLOOM WITH ROSES
 GOOD MORNING SAID THE ROSES
 THE LITTLE PRINCE GAZED AT THEM
 THEY ALL LOOKED LIKE HIS FLOWER
 WHO ARE YOU
 HE DEMANDED THUNDERSTRUCK
 WE ARE ROSES THE ROSES SAID
 AND HE WAS OVERCOME WITH SADNESS
 HIS FLOWER HAD TOLD HIM THAT SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF HER KIND IN ALL THE UNIVERSE
 AND HERE WERE FIVE THOUSAND OF THEM ALL ALIKE IN ONE SINGLE GARDEN
 SHE WOULD BE VERY MUCH ANNOYED HE SAID TO HIMSELF IF SHE SHOULD SEE THAT


 SHE WOULD COUGH MOST DREADFULLY AND SHE WOULD PRETEND THAT SHE WAS DYING TO AVOID BEING LAUGHED AT
 AND I SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO PRETEND THAT I WAS NURSING HER BACK TO LIFE FOR IF I DID NOT DO THAT TO HUMBLE MYSELF ALSO SHE WOULD REALLY ALLOW HERSELF TO DIE


 THEN HE WENT ON WITH HIS REFLECTIONS I THOUGHT THAT I WAS RICH WITH A FLOWER THAT WAS UNIQUE IN ALL THE WORLD AND ALL I HAD WAS A COMMON ROSE
 A COMMON ROSE AND THREE VOLCANOES THAT COME UP TO MY KNEES  AND ONE OF THEM PERHAPS EXTINCT FOREVER


 THAT DOESNT MAKE ME A VERY GREAT PRINCE


 AND HE LAY DOWN IN THE GRASS AND CRIED
 IT WAS THEN THAT THE FOX APPEARED
 GOOD MORNING SAID THE FOX
 GOOD MORNING THE LITTLE PRINCE RESPONDED POLITELY ALTHOUGH WHEN HE TURNED AROUND HE SAW NOTHING
 I AM RIGHT HERE THE VOICE SAID UNDER THE APPLE TREE
  WHO ARE YOU
 ASKED THE LITTLE PRINCE AND ADDED YOU ARE VERY PRETTY TO LOOK AT
 I AM A FOX SAID THE FOX
 COME AND PLAY WITH ME PROPOSED THE LITTLE PRINCE
 I AM SO UNHAPPY
 I CANNOT PLAY WITH YOU THE FOX SAID
 I AM NOT TAMED
 AH
 PLEASE EXCUSE ME SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 BUT AFTER SOME THOUGHT HE ADDED WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TAME
 YOU DO NOT LIVE HERE SAID THE FOX
 WHAT IS IT THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
 I AM LOOKING FOR MEN SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TAME
 MEN SAID THE FOX
 THEY HAVE GUNS AND THEY HUNT
 IT IS VERY DISTURBING
 THEY ALSO RAISE CHICKENS
 THESE ARE THEIR ONLY INTERESTS
 ARE YOU LOOKING FOR CHICKENS
 NO SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 I AM LOOKING FOR FRIENDS
 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TAME
 IT IS AN ACT TOO OFTEN NEGLECTED SAID THE FOX
 IT MEANS TO ESTABLISH TIES
 TO ESTABLISH TIES
 JUST THAT SAID THE FOX
 TO ME YOU ARE STILL NOTHING MORE THAN A LITTLE BOY WHO IS JUST LIKE A HUNDRED THOUSAND OTHER LITTLE BOYS
 AND I HAVE NO NEED OF YOU
 AND YOU ON YOUR PART HAVE NO NEED OF ME
 TO YOU I AM NOTHING MORE THAN A FOX LIKE A HUNDRED THOUSAND OTHER FOXES
 BUT IF YOU TAME ME THEN WE SHALL NEED EACH OTHER
 TO ME YOU WILL BE UNIQUE IN ALL THE WORLD
 TO YOU I SHALL BE UNIQUE IN ALL THE WORLD


 I AM BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 THERE IS A FLOWER


 I THINK THAT SHE HAS TAMED ME


 IT IS POSSIBLE SAID THE FOX
 ON THE EARTH ONE SEES ALL SORTS OF THINGS
 OH BUT THIS IS NOT ON THE EARTH
 SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 THE FOX SEEMED PERPLEXED AND VERY CURIOUS
 ON ANOTHER PLANET
 YES
 ARE THERE HUNTERS ON THIS PLANET
 NO
 AH THAT IS INTERESTING
 ARE THERE CHICKENS
 NO
 NOTHING IS PERFECT SIGHED THE FOX
 BUT HE CAME BACK TO HIS IDEA
 MY LIFE IS VERY MONOTONOUS THE FOX SAID
 I HUNT CHICKENS MEN HUNT ME
 ALL THE CHICKENS ARE JUST ALIKE AND ALL THE MEN ARE JUST ALIKE
 AND IN CONSEQUENCE I AM A LITTLE BORED
 BUT IF YOU TAME ME IT WILL BE AS IF THE SUN CAME TO SHINE ON MY LIFE
 I SHALL KNOW THE SOUND OF A STEP THAT WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE OTHERS
 OTHER STEPS SEND ME HURRYING BACK UNDERNEATH THE GROUND
 YOURS WILL CALL ME LIKE MUSIC OUT OF MY BURROW
 AND THEN LOOK YOU SEE THE GRAINFIELDS DOWN YONDER
 I DO NOT EAT BREAD
 WHEAT IS OF NO USE TO ME
 THE WHEAT FIELDS HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO ME
 AND THAT IS SAD
 BUT YOU HAVE HAIR THAT IS THE COLOUR OF GOLD
 THINK HOW WONDERFUL THAT WILL BE WHEN YOU HAVE TAMED ME
 THE GRAIN WHICH IS ALSO GOLDEN WILL BRING ME BACK THE THOUGHT OF YOU
 AND I SHALL LOVE TO LISTEN TO THE WIND IN THE WHEAT


 THE FOX GAZED AT THE LITTLE PRINCE FOR A LONG TIME
 PLEASE TAME ME
 HE SAID
 I WANT TO VERY MUCH THE LITTLE PRINCE REPLIED
 BUT I HAVE NOT MUCH TIME
 I HAVE FRIENDS TO DISCOVER AND A GREAT MANY THINGS TO UNDERSTAND
 ONE ONLY UNDERSTANDS THE THINGS THAT ONE TAMES SAID THE FOX
 MEN HAVE NO MORE TIME TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING
 THEY BUY THINGS ALL READYMADE AT THE SHOPS
 BUT THERE IS NO SHOP ANYWHERE WHERE ONE CAN BUY FRIENDSHIP AND SO MEN HAVE NO FRIENDS ANY MORE
 IF YOU WANT A FRIEND TAME ME


 WHAT MUST I DO TO TAME YOU
 ASKED THE LITTLE PRINCE
 YOU MUST BE VERY PATIENT REPLIED THE FOX
 FIRST YOU WILL SIT DOWN AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM ME LIKE THAT IN THE GRASS
 I SHALL LOOK AT YOU OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE AND YOU WILL SAY NOTHING
 WORDS ARE THE SOURCE OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS
 BUT YOU WILL SIT A LITTLE CLOSER TO ME EVERY DAY


 THE NEXT DAY THE LITTLE PRINCE CAME BACK
 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO COME BACK AT THE SAME HOUR SAID THE FOX
 IF FOR EXAMPLE YOU COME AT FOUR OCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THEN AT THREE OCLOCK I SHALL BEGIN TO BE HAPPY
 I SHALL FEEL HAPPIER AND HAPPIER AS THE HOUR ADVANCES
 AT FOUR OCLOCK I SHALL ALREADY BE WORRYING AND JUMPING ABOUT
 I SHALL SHOW YOU HOW HAPPY I AM
 BUT IF YOU COME AT JUST ANY TIME I SHALL NEVER KNOW AT WHAT HOUR MY HEART IS TO BE READY TO GREET YOU


 ONE MUST OBSERVE THE PROPER RITES


 WHAT IS A RITE
 ASKED THE LITTLE PRINCE
 THOSE ALSO ARE ACTIONS TOO OFTEN NEGLECTED SAID THE FOX
 THEY ARE WHAT MAKE ONE DAY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER DAYS ONE HOUR FROM OTHER HOURS
 THERE IS A RITE FOR EXAMPLE AMONG MY HUNTERS
 EVERY THURSDAY THEY DANCE WITH THE VILLAGE GIRLS
 SO THURSDAY IS A WONDERFUL DAY FOR ME
 I CAN TAKE A WALK AS FAR AS THE VINEYARDS
 BUT IF THE HUNTERS DANCED AT JUST ANY TIME EVERY DAY WOULD BE LIKE EVERY OTHER DAY AND I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ANY VACATION AT ALL
 SO THE LITTLE PRINCE TAMED THE FOX
 AND WHEN THE HOUR OF HIS DEPARTURE DREW NEAR


 AH SAID THE FOX I SHALL CRY
 IT IS YOUR OWN FAULT SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 I NEVER WISHED YOU ANY SORT OF HARM BUT YOU WANTED ME TO TAME YOU


 YES THAT IS SO SAID THE FOX
 BUT NOW YOU ARE GOING TO CRY
 SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 YES THAT IS SO SAID THE FOX
 THEN IT HAS DONE YOU NO GOOD AT ALL
 IT HAS DONE ME GOOD SAID THE FOX BECAUSE OF THE COLOUR OF THE WHEAT FIELDS
 AND THEN HE ADDED GO AND LOOK AGAIN AT THE ROSES
 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND NOW THAT YOURS IS UNIQUE IN ALL THE WORLD
 THEN COME BACK TO SAY GOODBYE TO ME AND I WILL MAKE YOU A PRESENT OF A SECRET
 THE LITTLE PRINCE WENT AWAY TO LOOK AGAIN AT THE ROSES
 YOU ARE NOT AT ALL LIKE MY ROSE HE SAID
 AS YET YOU ARE NOTHING
 NO ONE HAS TAMED YOU AND YOU HAVE TAMED NO ONE
 YOU ARE LIKE MY FOX WHEN I FIRST KNEW HIM
 HE WAS ONLY A FOX LIKE A HUNDRED THOUSAND OTHER FOXES
 BUT I HAVE MADE HIM MY FRIEND AND NOW HE IS UNIQUE IN ALL THE WORLD
 AND THE ROSES WERE VERY MUCH EMBARRASSED
 YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL BUT YOU ARE EMPTY HE WENT ON
 ONE COULD NOT DIE FOR YOU
 TO BE SURE AN ORDINARY PASSERBY WOULD THINK THAT MY ROSE LOOKED JUST LIKE YOU THE ROSE THAT BELONGS TO ME
 BUT IN HERSELF ALONE SHE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ALL THE HUNDREDS OF YOU OTHER ROSES BECAUSE IT IS SHE THAT I HAVE WATERED BECAUSE IT IS SHE THAT I HAVE PUT UNDER THE GLASS GLOBE BECAUSE IT IS SHE THAT I HAVE SHELTERED BEHIND THE SCREEN BECAUSE IT IS FOR HER THAT I HAVE KILLED THE CATERPILLARS EXCEPT THE TWO OR THREE THAT WE SAVED TO BECOME BUTTERFLIES BECAUSE IT IS SHE THAT I HAVE LISTENED TO WHEN SHE GRUMBLED OR BOASTED OR EVEN SOMETIMES WHEN SHE SAID NOTHING
 BECAUSE SHE IS MY ROSE
 AND HE WENT BACK TO MEET THE FOX
 GOODBYE HE SAID
 GOODBYE SAID THE FOX
 AND NOW HERE IS MY SECRET A VERY SIMPLE SECRET IT IS ONLY WITH THE HEART THAT ONE CAN SEE RIGHTLY WHAT IS ESSENTIAL IS INVISIBLE TO THE EYE
 WHAT IS ESSENTIAL IS INVISIBLE TO THE EYE THE LITTLE PRINCE REPEATED SO THAT HE WOULD BE SURE TO REMEMBER
 IT IS THE TIME YOU HAVE WASTED FOR YOUR ROSE THAT MAKES YOUR ROSE SO IMPORTANT
 IT IS THE TIME I HAVE WASTED FOR MY ROSE


 SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE SO THAT HE WOULD BE SURE TO REMEMBER
 MEN HAVE FORGOTTEN THIS TRUTH SAID THE FOX
 BUT YOU MUST NOT FORGET IT
 YOU BECOME RESPONSIBLE FOREVER FOR WHAT YOU HAVE TAMED
 YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ROSE


 I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR MY ROSE THE LITTLE PRINCE REPEATED SO THAT HE WOULD BE SURE TO REMEMBER
 GOOD MORNING SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 GOOD MORNING SAID THE RAILWAY SWITCHMAN
 WHAT DO YOU DO HERE
 THE LITTLE PRINCE ASKED
 I SORT OUT TRAVELLERS IN BUNDLES OF A THOUSAND SAID THE SWITCHMAN
 I SEND OFF THE TRAINS THAT CARRY THEM NOW TO THE RIGHT NOW TO THE LEFT
 AND A BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED EXPRESS TRAIN SHOOK THE SWITCHMANS CABIN AS IT RUSHED BY WITH A ROAR LIKE THUNDER
 THEY ARE IN A GREAT HURRY SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR
 NOT EVEN THE LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEER KNOWS THAT SAID THE SWITCHMAN
 AND A SECOND BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED EXPRESS THUNDERED BY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
 ARE THEY COMING BACK ALREADY
 DEMANDED THE LITTLE PRINCE
 THESE ARE NOT THE SAME ONES SAID THE SWITCHMAN
 IT IS AN EXCHANGE
 WERE THEY NOT SATISFIED WHERE THEY WERE
 ASKED THE LITTLE PRINCE
 NO ONE IS EVER SATISFIED WHERE HE IS SAID THE SWITCHMAN
 AND THEY HEARD THE ROARING THUNDER OF A THIRD BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED EXPRESS
 ARE THEY PURSUING THE FIRST TRAVELLERS
 DEMANDED THE LITTLE PRINCE
 THEY ARE PURSUING NOTHING AT ALL SAID THE SWITCHMAN
 THEY ARE ASLEEP IN THERE OR IF THEY ARE NOT ASLEEP THEY ARE YAWNING
 ONLY THE CHILDREN ARE FLATTENING THEIR NOSES AGAINST THE WINDOWPANES
 ONLY THE CHILDREN KNOW WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 THEY WASTE THEIR TIME OVER A RAG DOLL AND IT BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM AND IF ANYBODY TAKES IT AWAY FROM THEM THEY CRY


 THEY ARE LUCKY THE SWITCHMAN SAID
 GOOD MORNING SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 GOOD MORNING SAID THE MERCHANT
 THIS WAS A MERCHANT WHO SOLD PILLS THAT HAD BEEN INVENTED TO QUENCH THIRST
 YOU NEED ONLY SWALLOW ONE PILL A WEEK AND YOU WOULD FEEL NO NEED OF ANYTHING TO DRINK
 WHY ARE YOU SELLING THOSE
 ASKED THE LITTLE PRINCE
 BECAUSE THEY SAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME SAID THE MERCHANT
 COMPUTATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE BY EXPERTS
 WITH THESE PILLS YOU SAVE FIFTYTHREE MINUTES IN EVERY WEEK
 AND WHAT DO I DO WITH THOSE FIFTYTHREE MINUTES
 ANYTHING YOU LIKE


 AS FOR ME SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE TO HIMSELF IF I HAD FIFTYTHREE MINUTES TO SPEND AS I LIKED I SHOULD WALK AT MY LEISURE TOWARD A SPRING OF FRESH WATER
 IT WAS NOW THE EIGHTH DAY SINCE I HAD HAD MY ACCIDENT IN THE DESERT AND I HAD LISTENED TO THE STORY OF THE MERCHANT AS I WAS DRINKING THE LAST DROP OF MY WATER SUPPLY
 AH I SAID TO THE LITTLE PRINCE THESE MEMORIES OF YOURS ARE VERY CHARMING BUT I HAVE NOT YET SUCCEEDED IN REPAIRING MY PLANE I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DRINK AND I TOO SHOULD BE VERY HAPPY IF I COULD WALK AT MY LEISURE TOWARD A SPRING OF FRESH WATER
 MY FRIEND THE FOX


 THE LITTLE PRINCE SAID TO ME
 MY DEAR LITTLE MAN THIS IS NO LONGER A MATTER THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE FOX
 WHY NOT
 BECAUSE I AM ABOUT TO DIE OF THIRST


 HE DID NOT FOLLOW MY REASONING AND HE ANSWERED ME IT IS A GOOD THING TO HAVE HAD A FRIEND EVEN IF ONE IS ABOUT TO DIE
 I FOR INSTANCE AM VERY GLAD TO HAVE HAD A FOX AS A FRIEND


 HE HAS NO WAY OF GUESSING THE DANGER I SAID TO MYSELF
 HE HAS NEVER BEEN EITHER HUNGRY OR THIRSTY
 A LITTLE SUNSHINE IS ALL HE NEEDS


 BUT HE LOOKED AT ME STEADILY AND REPLIED TO MY THOUGHT I AM THIRSTY TOO
 LET US LOOK FOR A WELL


 I MADE A GESTURE OF WEARINESS
 IT IS ABSURD TO LOOK FOR A WELL AT RANDOM IN THE IMMENSITY OF THE DESERT
 BUT NEVERTHELESS WE STARTED WALKING
 WHEN WE HAD TRUDGED ALONG FOR SEVERAL HOURS IN SILENCE THE DARKNESS FELL AND THE STARS BEGAN TO COME OUT
 THIRST HAD MADE ME A LITTLE FEVERISH AND I LOOKED AT THEM AS IF I WERE IN A DREAM
 THE LITTLE PRINCES LAST WORDS CAME REELING BACK INTO MY MEMORY THEN YOU ARE THIRSTY TOO
 I DEMANDED
 BUT HE DID NOT REPLY TO MY QUESTION
 HE MERELY SAID TO ME WATER MAY ALSO BE GOOD FOR THE HEART


 I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THIS ANSWER BUT I SAID NOTHING
 I KNEW VERY WELL THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CROSSEXAMINE HIM
 HE WAS TIRED
 HE SAT DOWN
 I SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM
 AND AFTER A LITTLE SILENCE HE SPOKE AGAIN THE STARS ARE BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE OF A FLOWER THAT CANNOT BE SEEN
 I REPLIED YES THAT IS SO
 AND WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING MORE I LOOKED ACROSS THE RIDGES OF SAND THAT WERE STRETCHED OUT BEFORE US IN THE MOONLIGHT
 THE DESERT IS BEAUTIFUL THE LITTLE PRINCE ADDED
 AND THAT WAS TRUE
 I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE DESERT
 ONE SITS DOWN ON A DESERT SAND DUNE SEES NOTHING HEARS NOTHING
 YET THROUGH THE SILENCE SOMETHING THROBS AND GLEAMS


 WHAT MAKES THE DESERT BEAUTIFUL SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE IS THAT SOMEWHERE IT HIDES A WELL


 I WAS ASTONISHED BY A SUDDEN UNDERSTANDING OF THAT MYSTERIOUS RADIATION OF THE SANDS
 WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY I LIVED IN AN OLD HOUSE AND LEGEND TOLD US THAT A TREASURE WAS BURIED THERE
 TO BE SURE NO ONE HAD EVER KNOWN HOW TO FIND IT PERHAPS NO ONE HAD EVER EVEN LOOKED FOR IT
 BUT IT CAST AN ENCHANTMENT OVER THAT HOUSE
 MY HOME WAS HIDING A SECRET IN THE DEPTHS OF ITS HEART


 YES I SAID TO THE LITTLE PRINCE
 THE HOUSE THE STARS THE DESERT  WHAT GIVES THEM THEIR BEAUTY IS SOMETHING THAT IS INVISIBLE
 I AM GLAD HE SAID THAT YOU AGREE WITH MY FOX
 AS THE LITTLE PRINCE DROPPED OFF TO SLEEP I TOOK HIM IN MY ARMS AND SET OUT WALKING ONCE MORE
 I FELT DEEPLY MOVED AND STIRRED
 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I WAS CARRYING A VERY FRAGILE TREASURE
 IT SEEMED TO ME EVEN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE FRAGILE ON ALL EARTH
 IN THE MOONLIGHT I LOOKED AT HIS PALE FOREHEAD HIS CLOSED EYES HIS LOCKS OF HAIR THAT TREMBLED IN THE WIND AND I SAID TO MYSELF WHAT I SEE HERE IS NOTHING BUT A SHELL
 WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IS INVISIBLE


 AS HIS LIPS OPENED SLIGHTLY WITH THE SUSPICIOUS OF A HALFSMILE I SAID TO MYSELF AGAIN WHAT MOVES ME SO DEEPLY ABOUT THIS LITTLE PRINCE WHO IS SLEEPING HERE IS HIS LOYALTY TO A FLOWER  THE IMAGE OF A ROSE THAT SHINES THROUGH HIS WHOLE BEING LIKE THE FLAME OF A LAMP EVEN WHEN HE IS ASLEEP


 AND I FELT HIM TO BE MORE FRAGILE STILL
 I FELT THE NEED OF PROTECTING HIM AS IF HE HIMSELF WERE A FLAME THAT MIGHT BE EXTINGUISHED BY A LITTLE PUFF OF WIND


 AND AS I WALKED ON SO I FOUND THE WELL AT DAYBREAK
 MEN SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE SET OUT ON THEIR WAY IN EXPRESS TRAINS BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR
 THEN THEY RUSH ABOUT AND GET EXCITED AND TURN ROUND AND ROUND


 AND HE ADDED IT IS NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE


 THE WELL THAT WE HAD COME TO WAS NOT LIKE THE WELLS OF THE SAHARA
 THE WELLS OF THE SAHARA ARE MERE HOLES DUG IN THE SAND
 THIS ONE WAS LIKE A WELL IN A VILLAGE
 BUT THERE WAS NO VILLAGE HERE AND I THOUGHT I MUST BE DREAMING


 IT IS STRANGE I SAID TO THE LITTLE PRINCE
 EVERYTHING IS READY FOR USE THE PULLEY THE BUCKET THE ROPE


 HE LAUGHED TOUCHED THE ROPE AND SET THE PULLEY TO WORKING
 AND THE PULLEY MOANED LIKE AN OLD WEATHERVANE WHICH THE WIND HAS LONG SINCE FORGOTTEN
 DO YOU HEAR
 SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 WE HAVE WAKENED THE WELL AND IT IS SINGING


 I DID NOT WANT HIM TO TIRE HIMSELF WITH THE ROPE
 LEAVE IT TO ME I SAID
 IT IS TOO HEAVY FOR YOU
 I HOISTED THE BUCKET SLOWLY TO THE EDGE OF THE WELL AND SET IT THERE HAPPY TIRED AS I WAS OVER MY ACHIEVEMENT
 THE SONG OF THE PULLEY WAS STILL IN MY EARS AND I COULD SEE THE SUNLIGHT SHIMMER IN THE STILL TREMBLING WATER
 I AM THIRSTY FOR THIS WATER SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 GIVE ME SOME OF IT TO DRINK


 AND I UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR
 I RAISED THE BUCKET TO HIS LIPS
 HE DRANK HIS EYES CLOSED
 IT WAS AS SWEET AS SOME SPECIAL FESTIVAL TREAT
 THIS WATER WAS INDEED A DIFFERENT THING FROM ORDINARY NOURISHMENT
 ITS SWEETNESS WAS BORN OF THE WALK UNDER THE STARS THE SONG OF THE PULLEY THE EFFORT OF MY ARMS
 IT WAS GOOD FOR THE HEART LIKE A PRESENT
 WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY THE LIGHTS OF THE CHRISTMAS TREE THE MUSIC OF THE MIDNIGHT MASS THE TENDERNESS OF SMILING FACES USED TO MAKE UP SO THE RADIANCE OF THE GIFTS I RECEIVED
 THE MEN WHERE YOU LIVE SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE RAISE FIVE THOUSAND ROSES IN THE SAME GARDEN AND THEY DO NOT FIND IN IT WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR
 THEY DO NOT FIND IT I REPLIED
 AND YET WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR COULD BE FOUND IN ONE SINGLE ROSE OR IN A LITTLE WATER
 YES THAT IS TRUE I SAID
 AND THE LITTLE PRINCE ADDED BUT THE EYES ARE BLIND
 ONE MUST LOOK WITH THE HEART


 I HAD DRUNK THE WATER
 I BREATHED EASILY
 AT SUNRISE THE SAND IS THE COLOUR OF HONEY
 AND THAT HONEY COLOUR WAS MAKING ME HAPPY TOO
 WHAT BROUGHT ME THEN THIS SENSE OF GRIEF
 YOU MUST KEEP YOUR PROMISE SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE SOFTLY AS HE SAT DOWN BESIDE ME ONCE MORE
 WHAT PROMISE
 YOU KNOW A MUZZLE FOR MY SHEEP


 I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS FLOWER


 I TOOK MY ROUGH DRAFTS OF DRAWINGS OUT OF MY POCKET
 THE LITTLE PRINCE LOOKED THEM OVER AND LAUGHED AS HE SAID YOUR BAOBABS THEY LOOK A LITTLE LIKE CABBAGES
 OH
 I HAD BEEN SO PROUD OF MY BAOBABS
 YOUR FOX HIS EARS LOOK A LITTLE LIKE HORNS AND THEY ARE TOO LONG
 AND HE LAUGHED AGAIN
 YOU ARE NOT FAIR LITTLE PRINCE I SAID
 I DONT KNOW HOW TO DRAW ANYTHING EXCEPT BOA CONSTRICTORS FROM THE OUTSIDE AND BOA CONSTRICTORS FROM THE INSIDE
 OH THAT WILL BE ALL RIGHT HE SAID CHILDREN UNDERSTAND
 SO THEN I MADE A PENCIL SKETCH OF A MUZZLE
 AND AS I GAVE IT TO HIM MY HEART WAS TORN
 YOU HAVE PLANS THAT I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT I SAID
 BUT HE DID NOT ANSWER ME
 HE SAID TO ME INSTEAD YOU KNOW MY DESCENT TO THE EARTH


 TOMORROW WILL BE ITS ANNIVERSARY
 THEN AFTER A SILENCE HE WENT ON I CAME DOWN VERY NEAR HERE
 AND HE FLUSHED
 AND ONCE AGAIN WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHY I HAD A QUEER SENSE OF SORROW
 ONE QUESTION HOWEVER OCCURRED TO ME THEN IT WAS NOT BY CHANCE THAT ON THE MORNING WHEN I FIRST MET YOU  A WEEK AGO  YOU WERE STROLLING ALONG LIKE THAT ALL ALONE A THOUSAND MILES FROM ANY INHABITED REGION
 YOU WERE ON THE YOUR WAY BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU LANDED
 THE LITTLE PRINCE FLUSHED AGAIN
 AND I ADDED WITH SOME HESITANCY PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE ANNIVERSARY
 THE LITTLE PRINCE FLUSHED ONCE MORE
 HE NEVER ANSWERED QUESTIONS BUT WHEN ONE FLUSHES DOES THAT NOT MEAN YES
 AH I SAID TO HIM I AM A LITTLE FRIGHTENED


 BUT HE INTERRUPTED ME
 NOW YOU MUST WORK
 YOU MUST RETURN TO YOUR ENGINE
 I WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU HERE
 COME BACK TOMORROW EVENING


 BUT I WAS NOT REASSURED
 I REMEMBERED THE FOX
 ONE RUNS THE RISK OF WEEPING A LITTLE IF ONE LETS HIMSELF BE TAMED


 BESIDE THE WELL THERE WAS THE RUIN OF AN OLD STONE WALL
 WHEN I CAME BACK FROM MY WORK THE NEXT EVENING I SAW FROM SOME DISTANCE AWAY MY LITTLE PRINCE SITTING ON TOP OF A WALL WITH HIS FEET DANGLING
 AND I HEARD HIM SAY THEN YOU DONT REMEMBER
 THIS IS NOT THE EXACT SPOT
 ANOTHER VOICE MUST HAVE ANSWERED HIM FOR HE REPLIED TO IT YES YES
 IT IS THE RIGHT DAY BUT THIS IS NOT THE PLACE
 I CONTINUED MY WALK TOWARD THE WALL
 AT NO TIME DID I SEE OR HEAR ANYONE
 THE LITTLE PRINCE HOWEVER REPLIED ONCE AGAIN 


EXACTLY
 YOU WILL SEE WHERE MY TRACK BEGINS IN THE SAND
 YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT WAIT FOR ME THERE
 I SHALL BE THERE TONIGHT
 I WAS ONLY TWENTY METRES FROM THE WALL AND I STILL SAW NOTHING
 AFTER A SILENCE THE LITTLE PRINCE SPOKE AGAIN YOU HAVE GOOD POISON
 YOU ARE SURE THAT IT WILL NOT MAKE ME SUFFER TOO LONG
 I STOPPED IN MY TRACKS MY HEART TORN ASUNDER BUT STILL I DID NOT UNDERSTAND
 NOW GO AWAY SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 I WANT TO GET DOWN FROM THE WALL
 I DROPPED MY EYES THEN TO THE FOOT OF THE WALL


 AND I LEAPED INTO THE AIR
 THERE BEFORE ME FACING THE LITTLE PRINCE WAS ONE OF THOSE YELLOW SNAKES THAT TAKE JUST THIRTY SECONDS TO BRING YOUR LIFE TO AN END
 EVEN AS I WAS DIGGING INTO MY POCKED TO GET OUT MY REVOLVER I MADE A RUNNING STEP BACK
 BUT AT THE NOISE I MADE THE SNAKE LET HIMSELF FLOW EASILY ACROSS THE SAND LIKE THE DYING SPRAY OF A FOUNTAIN AND IN NO APPARENT HURRY DISAPPEARED WITH A LIGHT METALLIC SOUND AMONG THE STONES
 I REACHED THE WALL JUST IN TIME TO CATCH MY LITTLE MAN IN MY ARMS HIS FACE WAS WHITE AS SNOW
 WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
 I DEMANDED
 WHY ARE YOU TALKING WITH SNAKES
 I HAD LOOSENED THE GOLDEN MUFFLER THAT HE ALWAYS WORE
 I HAD MOISTENED HIS TEMPLES AND HAD GIVEN HIM SOME WATER TO DRINK
 AND NOW I DID NOT DARE ASK HIM ANY MORE QUESTIONS
 HE LOOKED AT ME VERY GRAVELY AND PUT HIS ARMS AROUND MY NECK
 I FELT HIS HEART BEATING LIKE THE HEART OF A DYING BIRD SHOT WITH SOMEONES RIFLE


 I AM GLAD THAT YOU HAVE FOUND WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH YOUR ENGINE HE SAID
 NOW YOU CAN GO BACK HOME HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT
 I WAS JUST COMING TO TELL HIM THAT MY WORK HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL BEYOND ANYTHING THAT I HAD DARED TO HOPE
 HE MADE NO ANSWER TO MY QUESTION BUT HE ADDED I TOO AM GOING BACK HOME TODAY


 THEN SADLY IT IS MUCH FARTHER


 IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT


 I REALISED CLEARLY THAT SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY WAS HAPPENING
 I WAS HOLDING HIM CLOSE IN MY ARMS AS IF HE WERE A LITTLE CHILD AND YET IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE WAS RUSHING HEADLONG TOWARD AN ABYSS FROM WHICH I COULD DO NOTHING TO RESTRAIN HIM


 HIS LOOK WAS VERY SERIOUS LIKE SOME ONE LOST FAR AWAY
 I HAVE YOUR SHEEP
 AND I HAVE THE SHEEPS BOX
 AND I HAVE THE MUZZLE


 AND HE GAVE ME A SAD SMILE
 I WAITED A LONG TIME
 I COULD SEE THAT HE WAS REVIVING LITTLE BY LITTLE
 DEAR LITTLE MAN I SAID TO HIM YOU ARE AFRAID


 HE WAS AFRAID THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT
 BUT HE LAUGHED LIGHTLY
 I SHALL BE MUCH MORE AFRAID THIS EVENING


 ONCE AGAIN I FELT MYSELF FROZEN BY THE SENSE OF SOMETHING IRREPARABLE
 AND I KNEW THAT I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF NEVER HEARING THAT LAUGHTER ANY MORE
 FOR ME IT WAS LIKE A SPRING OF FRESH WATER IN THE DESERT
 LITTLE MAN I SAID I WANT TO HEAR YOU LAUGH AGAIN
 BUT HE SAID TO ME TONIGHT IT WILL BE A YEAR


 MY STAR THEN CAN BE FOUND RIGHT ABOVE THE PLACE WHERE I CAME TO THE EARTH A YEAR AGO


 LITTLE MAN I SAID TELL ME THAT IT IS ONLY A BAD DREAM THIS AFFAIR OF THE SNAKE AND THE MEETING PLACE AND THE STAR


 BUT HE DID NOT ANSWER MY PLEA
 HE SAID TO ME INSTEAD THE THING THAT IS IMPORTANT IS THE THING THAT IS NOT SEEN


 YES I KNOW


 IT IS JUST AS IT IS WITH THE FLOWER
 IF YOU LOVE A FLOWER THAT LIVES ON A STAR IT IS SWEET TO LOOK AT THE SKY AT NIGHT
 ALL THE STARS ARE ABLOOM WITH FLOWERS


 YES I KNOW


 IT IS JUST AS IT IS WITH THE WATER
 BECAUSE OF THE PULLEY AND THE ROPE WHAT YOU GAVE ME TO DRINK WAS LIKE MUSIC
 YOU REMEMBER HOW GOOD IT WAS
 YES I KNOW


 AND AT NIGHT YOU WILL LOOK UP AT THE STARS
 WHERE I LIVE EVERYTHING IS SO SMALL THAT I CANNOT SHOW YOU WHERE MY STAR IS TO BE FOUND
 IT IS BETTER LIKE THAT
 MY STAR WILL JUST BE ONE OF THE STARS FOR YOU
 AND SO YOU WILL LOVE TO WATCH ALL THE STARS IN THE HEAVENS


 THEY WILL ALL BE YOUR FRIENDS
 AND BESIDES I AM GOING TO MAKE YOU A PRESENT


 HE LAUGHED AGAIN
 AH LITTLE PRINCE DEAR LITTLE PRINCE
 I LOVE TO HEAR THAT LAUGHTER
 THAT IS MY PRESENT
 JUST THAT
 IT WILL BE AS IT WAS WHEN WE DRANK THE WATER


 WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY
 ALL MEN HAVE THE STARS HE ANSWERED BUT THEY ARE NOT THE SAME THINGS FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE
 FOR SOME WHO ARE TRAVELLERS THE STARS ARE GUIDES
 FOR OTHERS THEY ARE NO MORE THAN LITTLE LIGHTS IN THE SKY
 FOR OTHERS WHO ARE SCHOLARS THEY ARE PROBLEMS
 FOR MY BUSINESSMAN THEY WERE WEALTH
 BUT ALL THESE STARS ARE SILENT
 YOU YOU ALONE WILL HAVE THE STARS AS NO ONE ELSE HAS THEM WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY
 IN ONE OF THE STARS I SHALL BE LIVING
 IN ONE OF THEM I SHALL BE LAUGHING
 AND SO IT WILL BE AS IF ALL THE STARS WERE LAUGHING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SKY AT NIGHT


 YOU ONLY YOU WILL HAVE STARS THAT CAN LAUGH
 AND HE LAUGHED AGAIN
 AND WHEN YOUR SORROW IS COMFORTED TIME SOOTHES ALL SORROWS YOU WILL BE CONTENT THAT YOU HAVE KNOWN ME
 YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MY FRIEND
 YOU WILL WANT TO LAUGH WITH ME
 AND YOU WILL SOMETIMES OPEN YOUR WINDOW SO FOR THAT PLEASURE


 AND YOUR FRIENDS WILL BE PROPERLY ASTONISHED TO SEE YOU LAUGHING AS YOU LOOK UP AT THE SKY
 THEN YOU WILL SAY TO THEM YES THE STARS ALWAYS MAKE ME LAUGH
 AND THEY WILL THINK YOU ARE CRAZY
 IT WILL BE A VERY SHABBY TRICK THAT I SHALL HAVE PLAYED ON YOU


 AND HE LAUGHED AGAIN
 IT WILL BE AS IF IN PLACE OF THE STARS I HAD GIVEN YOU A GREAT NUMBER OF LITTLE BELLS THAT KNEW HOW TO LAUGH


 AND HE LAUGHED AGAIN
 THEN HE QUICKLY BECAME SERIOUS TONIGHT YOU KNOW


 DO NOT COME SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
 I SHALL NOT LEAVE YOU I SAID
 I SHALL LOOK AS IF I WERE SUFFERING
 I SHALL LOOK A LITTLE AS IF I WERE DYING
 IT IS LIKE THAT
 DO NOT COME TO SEE THAT
 IT IS NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE


 I SHALL NOT LEAVE YOU
 BUT HE WAS WORRIED
 I TELL YOU IT IS ALSO BECAUSE OF THE SNAKE
 HE MUST NOT BITE YOU
 SNAKES THEY ARE MALICIOUS CREATURES
 THIS ONE MIGHT BITE YOU JUST FOR FUN


 I SHALL NOT LEAVE YOU
 BUT A THOUGHT CAME TO REASSURE HIM IT IS TRUE THAT THEY HAVE NO MORE POISON FOR A SECOND BITE
 THAT NIGHT I DID NOT SEE HIM SET OUT ON HIS WAY
 HE GOT AWAY FROM ME WITHOUT MAKING A SOUND
 WHEN I SUCCEEDED IN CATCHING UP WITH HIM HE WAS WALKING ALONG WITH A QUICK AND RESOLUTE STEP
 HE SAID TO ME MERELY AH
 YOU ARE THERE


 AND HE TOOK ME BY THE HAND
 BUT HE WAS STILL WORRYING
 IT WAS WRONG OF YOU TO COME
 YOU WILL SUFFER
 I SHALL LOOK AS IF I WERE DEAD AND THAT WILL NOT BE TRUE


 I SAID NOTHING
 YOU UNDERSTAND


 IT IS TOO FAR
 I CANNOT CARRY THIS BODY WITH ME
 IT IS TOO HEAVY
 I SAID NOTHING
 BUT IT WILL BE LIKE AN OLD ABANDONED SHELL
 THERE IS NOTHING SAD ABOUT OLD SHELLS


 I SAID NOTHING
 HE WAS A LITTLE DISCOURAGED
 BUT HE MADE ONE MORE EFFORT YOU KNOW IT WILL BE VERY NICE
 I TOO SHALL LOOK AT THE STARS
 ALL THE STARS WILL BE WELLS WITH A RUSTY PULLEY
 ALL THE STARS WILL POUR OUT FRESH WATER FOR ME TO DRINK


 I SAID NOTHING
 THAT WILL BE SO AMUSING
 YOU WILL HAVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION LITTLE BELLS AND I SHALL HAVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION SPRINGS OF FRESH WATER


 AND HE TOO SAID NOTHING MORE BECAUSE HE WAS CRYING


 HERE IT IS
 LET ME GO ON BY MYSELF
 AND HE SAT DOWN BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID
 THEN HE SAID AGAIN YOU KNOW MY FLOWER


 I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR HER
 AND SHE IS SO WEAK
 SHE HAS FOUR THORNS OF NO USE AT ALL TO PROTECT HERSELF AGAINST ALL THE WORLD


 I TOO SAT DOWN BECAUSE I WAS NOT ABLE TO STAND UP ANY LONGER
 THERE NOW THAT IS ALL


 HE STILL HESITATED A LITTLE THEN HE GOT UP
 HE TOOK ONE STEP
 I COULD NOT MOVE
 THERE WAS NOTHING BUT A FLASH OF YELLOW CLOSE TO HIS ANKLE
 HE REMAINED MOTIONLESS FOR AN INSTANT
 HE DID NOT CRY OUT
 HE FELL AS GENTLY AS A TREE FALLS
 THERE WAS NOT EVEN ANY SOUND BECAUSE OF THE SAND
 AND NOW SIX YEARS HAVE ALREADY GONE BY


 I HAVE NEVER YET TOLD THIS STORY
 THE COMPANIONS WHO MET ME ON MY RETURN WERE WELL CONTENT TO SEE ME ALIVE
 I WAS SAD BUT I TOLD THEM I AM TIRED
 NOW MY SORROW IS COMFORTED A LITTLE
 THAT IS TO SAY NOT ENTIRELY
 BUT I KNOW THAT HE DID GO BACK TO HIS PLANET BECAUSE I DID NOT FIND HIS BODY AT DAYBREAK
 IT WAS NOT SUCH A HEAVY BODY


 AND AT NIGHT I LOVE TO LISTEN TO THE STARS
 IT IS LIKE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION LITTLE BELLS


 BUT THERE IS ONE EXTRAORDINARY THING


 WHEN I DREW THE MUZZLE FOR THE LITTLE PRINCE I FORGOT TO ADD THE LEATHER STRAP TO IT
 HE WILL NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FASTEN IT ON HIS SHEEP
 SO NOW I KEEP WONDERING WHAT IS HAPPENING ON HIS PLANET
 PERHAPS THE SHEEP HAS EATEN THE FLOWER


 AT ONE TIME I SAY TO MYSELF SURELY NOT
 THE LITTLE PRINCE SHUTS HIS FLOWER UNDER HER GLASS GLOBE EVERY NIGHT AND HE WATCHES OVER HIS SHEEP VERY CAREFULLY


 THEN I AM HAPPY
 AND THERE IS SWEETNESS IN THE LAUGHTER OF ALL THE STARS
 BUT AT ANOTHER TIME I SAY TO MYSELF AT SOME MOMENT OR OTHER ONE IS ABSENTMINDED AND THAT IS ENOUGH
 ON SOME ONE EVENING HE FORGOT THE GLASS GLOBE OR THE SHEEP GOT OUT WITHOUT MAKING ANY NOISE IN THE NIGHT


 AND THEN THE LITTLE BELLS ARE CHANGED TO TEARS


 HERE THEN IS A GREAT MYSTERY
 FOR YOU WHO ALSO LOVE THE LITTLE PRINCE AND FOR ME NOTHING IN THE UNIVERSE CAN BE THE SAME IF SOMEWHERE WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE A SHEEP THAT WE NEVER SAW HAS EATEN A ROSE


 LOOK UP AT THE SKY
 ASK YOURSELVES IS IT YES OR NO
 HAS THE SHEEP EATEN THE FLOWER
 AND YOU WILL SEE HOW EVERYTHING CHANGES


 AND NO GROWNUP WILL EVER UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A MATTER OF SO MUCH IMPORTANCE
 THIS IS TO ME THE LOVELIEST AND SADDEST LANDSCAPE IN THE WORLD
 IT IS THE SAME AS THAT ON THE PRECEDING PAGE BUT I HAVE DRAWN IT AGAIN TO IMPRESS IT ON YOUR MEMORY
 IT IS HERE THAT THE LITTLE PRINCE APPEARED ON EARTH AND DISAPPEARED
 LOOK AT IT CAREFULLY SO THAT YOU WILL BE SURE TO RECOGNISE IT IN CASE YOU TRAVEL SOME DAY TO THE AFRICAN DESERT
 AND IF YOU SHOULD COME UPON THIS SPOT PLEASE DO NOT HURRY ON
 WAIT FOR A TIME EXACTLY UNDER THE STAR
 THEN IF A LITTLE MAN APPEARS WHO LAUGHS WHO HAS GOLDEN HAIR AND WHO REFUSES TO ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU WILL KNOW WHO HE IS
 IF THIS SHOULD HAPPEN PLEASE COMFORT ME
 SEND ME WORD THAT HE HAS COME BACK
